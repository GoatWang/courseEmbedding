long days without wearing out the crew boyle enlisted makeup effects designer tony gardner and his effects company alterian inc to recreate the characters amputation of his own arm boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audiences investing in the characters experience and that the makeup effects success would impact the films success the false arm

with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful as he wanted to do justice to the story he credits james franco equally with the success of

enlisted makeup effects designer tony gardner and his effects company alterian inc to recreate the characters amputation of his own arm boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the

increasingly unpopular instead there was a toxic and destructive environment in which the interests of the client continue to be sidelined senior management described clients as muppets and colleagues

financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to

untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s

morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as

harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for

july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs

deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has

destructive environment in which the interests of the client continue to be sidelined senior management described clients as muppets and colleagues callously talked about ripping their clients off in

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal

financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on the sp  index by making multiple false entries into a goldman trading system when goldman sachs management uncovered the trades taylor was immediately fired the trades cost the company  million which taylor was ordered to repay in  taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to  months in prison in addition to the monetary damages danish utility sale edit goldman sachss purchase of an  stake

a nerve with the danish public which is still suffering from the aftereffects of the global financial crisis protesters in copenhagen gathered around a banner with a drawing of a vampire squid—the

slot canyon in blue john canyon southeastern utah in april  it is a british and american venture produced by everest entertainment film productions handmade films and cloud eight films the film based on ralstons memoir between a rock and a hard place  was written by boyle and simon beaufoy produced by christian colson and john smithson and scored by a r rahman beaufoy colson and rahman had all

ralston begins hiking at utahs canyonlands national park on foot he befriends hikers kristi and megan and shows them an underground pool after swimming aron parts ways with the hikers and continues through a slot canyon in blue john canyon while climbing down he slips and falls knocking a boulder which smashes his right hand and wrist against the wall stuck he tries calling for help but realizes that he is alone he begins recording a video diary to maintain morale chipping away parts of the boulder in order to free himself and to keep warm at night he rations his food and water in order to survive the ordeal he sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder days after being trapped ralston considers using his pocket knife to cut himself free but finds the dull blade unable to cut bone with no water he is forced to drink his urine his videos become desperate and depressed and he hallucinates about escape relationships and past experiences including a former lover family and kristi and megan during one of the hallucinations he realizes that his mistake was that he didnt tell anyone where he was going he thinks that it was destiny that the boulder trapped him using his knowledge of applying torque ralston fashions a crude tourniquet out of camelbak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it he then slowly amputates his arm successfully he wraps the stump of his arm to prevent exsanguination and takes a picture of the boulder he then rappels down a foot rockface using his other arm and drinks rainwater from a small pond he meets a family on a day hike who alert the authorities to ralstons presence and a utah highway patrol helicopter already dispatched arrives to bring him to a hospital the epilogue sequence reveals that he got married and started a family he continues to be a climber and a canyoneer and he now leaves a note saying where he has gone castedit james franco as aron ralston kate mara as kristi moore amber

aron ralston and his wife and son make cameo appearances at the end of the film authenticityedit inaccuraciesedit the scenes early in the film of ralstons encounter with the two hikers were altered to portray ralston showing them a hidden pool when in reality he just showed them some basic climbing moves despite these changes with which he was initially uncomfortable ralston says the rest of the film is so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama other changes from the book include omissions of descriptions of ralstons efforts after freeing himself his bike was chained to itself not to the tree as depicted at the beginning of the movie he had to decide where to seek the fastest medical attention he took a photo of himself at the small brown pool from which he really did drink he had his first bowel movement of the week he abandoned a lot of the items he had kept throughout his confinement he got lost in a side canyon and he met a family from the netherlands not an american family eric monique and andy meijer who already knew that he was probably lost in the area thanks to the searches of his parents and the authorities the actor who plays eric meijer pieter jan brugge is dutch accuraciesedit franco is never shown uttering even an ow ralston wrote that this is accurate ralston did send monique and andy to run ahead to get help and ralston did walk seven miles before the helicopter came although this trek is shown in the films alternative endingcitation needed productionedit danny boyle had been wanting to make a film about ralstons ordeal for four years he wrote a film treatment and simon beaufoy wrote the screenplay boyle describes  hours as an action movie with a guy who cant move he also expressed an interest for a more intimate film than his previous film slumdog millionaire  i remember thinking i must do a film where i follow an actor the way darren aronofsky did with the wrestler so  hours is my version of that boyle and fox searchlight announced plans to create  hours in november  and news of the world reported that month that cillian murphy was boyles top choice to play ralston in january  james franco was cast as ralston in march  filming began in utah boyle intended to shoot the first part of the film with no dialogue by  june  the film was in postproduction boyle made the very unusual move of hiring two cinematographers to work first unit anthony dod mantle and enrique chediak each of whom shot  percent of the film by trading off with each other this allowed boyle and franco to work long days without wearing out the crew boyle enlisted makeup effects designer tony gardner and his effects company alterian inc to recreate the characters amputation of his own arm boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audiences investing in the characters experience and that the makeup effects success would impact the films success the false arm rigs were created in layers from fiberglass and steel bone through silicone and fibrous muscle and tendon to functional veins and arteries and finally skinned with a translucent silicone layer of skin with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful as he wanted to do justice to the story he credits james franco equally with the success of the effects workcitation needed three prosthetics were used in all with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine  franco admitted that shooting the film was physically hard on him there was a lot of physical pain and danny knew that it was going to cause a lot of pain and i asked him after we did the movie how did you know how far you could push it  i had plenty of scarsnot only am i feeling physical pain but im getting exhausted it became less of a façade i put on and more of an experience that i went through releaseedit  hours was screened at the toronto international film festival on

emami wrote for the huffington post franco is mesmerizing as he steers his character from one who acts with reckless disregard to an introspective remorseful soul all the while maintaining his playful

kristi and megan and shows them an underground pool after swimming aron parts ways with the hikers and continues through a slot canyon in blue john canyon while climbing down he slips and falls knocking a boulder which smashes his right hand and wrist against the wall stuck he tries calling for help but realizes that he is alone he begins recording a video diary to maintain morale chipping away parts of the boulder in order to free himself and to keep warm at night he rations his food and water in order to survive the ordeal he sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder days after being trapped ralston considers using his pocket knife to cut himself free but finds the dull blade unable to cut bone with no water he is forced to drink his urine his videos become desperate and depressed and he hallucinates about escape relationships and past experiences including a former lover family and kristi and megan during one of the hallucinations he realizes that his mistake was that he didnt tell anyone where he was going he thinks that it was destiny that the boulder trapped him using his knowledge of applying torque ralston fashions a crude tourniquet out of camelbak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it he then slowly amputates his arm successfully he wraps the stump of his arm to prevent exsanguination and takes a picture of the boulder he then rappels down a foot rockface using his other arm and drinks rainwater from a small pond he meets a family on a day hike who alert the authorities to ralstons presence and a utah highway patrol helicopter already dispatched arrives to bring him to a hospital the epilogue sequence reveals that he got married and started a family he continues to be a climber

lover lizzy caplan as sonja ralston arons sister kate burton as donna ralston arons mother treat williams as larry ralston arons father aron ralston and his wife and son make cameo appearances at the end of the film authenticityedit inaccuraciesedit the scenes early in the film of ralstons encounter with the two hikers were altered to portray ralston showing them a hidden pool when in reality he just showed them some basic climbing moves despite these changes with which he was initially uncomfortable ralston says the rest of the film is so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama other changes from the book include omissions of descriptions of ralstons efforts after freeing himself his bike was chained to itself not to the tree as depicted at the beginning of the movie he had to decide where to seek the fastest medical attention he took a photo of himself at the small brown pool from which he really did drink he had his first bowel movement of the week he abandoned a lot of the items he had kept throughout his confinement he got lost in a side canyon and he met a family from the netherlands not an american family eric monique and andy meijer who already knew that he was probably lost in the area thanks to the searches of his parents and the authorities the actor who plays eric meijer pieter jan brugge is dutch accuraciesedit franco is never shown uttering even an ow ralston wrote that this is accurate ralston did send monique and andy to run ahead to get help and ralston did walk seven miles before the helicopter came although this trek is shown in the films alternative endingcitation needed productionedit danny boyle had been wanting to make a film about ralstons ordeal for four years he wrote a film treatment and simon beaufoy wrote the screenplay boyle describes  hours as an action movie with a guy who cant move he also expressed an interest for a more intimate film than his previous film slumdog millionaire  i remember thinking i must do a film where i follow an actor the way darren aronofsky did with the wrestler so  hours is my version of that boyle and fox searchlight announced plans to create  hours in november  and news of the world reported that month that cillian murphy was boyles top choice to play ralston in january  james franco was cast as ralston in march  filming began in utah boyle intended to shoot the first part of the film with no dialogue by  june  the film was in postproduction boyle made the very unusual move of hiring two cinematographers to work first unit anthony dod mantle and enrique chediak each of whom shot  percent of the film by trading off with each other this allowed boyle and franco to work long days without wearing out the crew boyle enlisted makeup effects designer tony gardner and his effects company alterian inc to recreate the characters amputation of his own arm boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audiences investing in the characters experience and that the makeup effects success would impact the films success the false arm rigs were created in layers from fiberglass and steel bone through silicone and fibrous muscle and tendon to functional veins and arteries and finally skinned with a translucent silicone layer of skin with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful as he wanted to do justice to the story he credits james franco equally with the success of the effects workcitation needed three prosthetics were used in all with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine  franco admitted that shooting the film was physically hard on him there was a lot of physical pain and danny knew that it was going to cause a lot of pain and i asked him after we did the movie how did you know how far you could push it  i had plenty of scarsnot only am i feeling physical pain but im getting exhausted it

one from investment banking and one from securities trading for most of the s and s this would be weinberg and levy levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance due to weinbergs heavy influence at the firm it formed an investment banking division in  in an attempt to spread around influence and not focus it all on weinberg in  levy took over as

future that same year weinberg retired from the firm another financial crisis for the firm occurred in  when the penn central transportation company went bankrupt with over  million in commercial

commission that resulted in goldman paying a  million settlement goldman sachs was excoriated by the press and the public according to journalists mclean and nocera  this despite the nonretail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye visibility and antagonism came from the  billion goldman received—more than any other firm—from aig counterparty payments

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to investors one of the largest penalties ever paid by a wall street firm in august  tourre was found liable on  of  counts by a federal jury the company did not admit or deny wrongdoing but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment contained incomplete information and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on

slot canyon in blue john canyon southeastern utah in april  it is a british and american venture produced by everest entertainment film productions handmade films and cloud eight films the film based on ralstons memoir between a rock and a hard place  was written by boyle and simon beaufoy produced by christian colson and john smithson and scored by a r rahman beaufoy colson and rahman had all

ralston begins hiking at utahs canyonlands national park on foot he befriends hikers kristi and megan and shows them an underground pool after swimming aron parts ways with the hikers and continues through a slot canyon in blue john canyon while climbing down he slips and falls knocking a boulder which smashes his right hand and wrist against the wall stuck he tries calling for help but realizes that he is alone he begins recording a video diary to maintain morale chipping away parts of the boulder in order to free himself and to keep warm at night he rations his food and water in order to survive the ordeal he sets up a pulley using his climbing rope in a futile attempt to lift the boulder days after being trapped ralston considers using his pocket knife to cut himself free but finds the dull blade unable to cut bone with no water he is forced to drink his urine his videos become desperate and depressed and he hallucinates about escape relationships and past experiences including a former lover family and kristi and megan during one of the hallucinations he realizes that his mistake was that he didnt tell anyone where he was going he thinks that it was destiny that the boulder trapped him using his knowledge of applying torque ralston fashions a crude tourniquet out of camelbak tube insulation and uses a carabiner to tighten it he then slowly amputates his arm successfully he wraps the stump of his arm to prevent exsanguination and takes a picture of the boulder he then rappels down a foot rockface using his other arm and drinks rainwater from a small pond he meets a family on a day hike who alert the authorities to ralstons presence and a utah highway patrol helicopter already dispatched arrives to bring him to a hospital the epilogue sequence reveals that he got married and started a family he continues to be a climber and a canyoneer and he now leaves a note saying where he has gone castedit james franco as aron ralston kate mara as kristi moore amber tamblyn as megan mcbride clémence poésy as rana aron ralstons lover lizzy caplan as sonja ralston arons sister kate burton as donna ralston arons mother treat williams as larry ralston arons father aron ralston and his wife and son make cameo appearances at the end of the film authenticityedit inaccuraciesedit the scenes early in the film of ralstons encounter with the two hikers were altered to portray ralston showing them a hidden pool when in reality he just showed them some basic climbing moves despite these changes with which he was initially uncomfortable ralston says the rest of the film is so factually accurate it is as close to a documentary as you can get and still be a drama other changes from the book include omissions of descriptions of ralstons efforts after freeing himself his bike was chained to itself not to the tree as depicted at the beginning of the movie he had to decide where to seek the fastest medical attention he took a photo of himself at the small brown pool from which he really did drink he had his first bowel movement of the week he abandoned a lot of the items he had kept throughout his confinement he got lost in a side canyon and he met a family from the netherlands not an american family eric monique and andy meijer who already knew that he was probably lost in the area thanks to the searches of his parents and the authorities the actor who plays eric meijer pieter jan brugge is dutch accuraciesedit franco is never shown uttering even an ow ralston wrote that this is accurate ralston did send monique and andy to run ahead to get help and ralston did walk seven miles before the helicopter came although this trek is shown in the films alternative endingcitation needed productionedit danny boyle had been wanting to make a film about ralstons ordeal for four years he wrote a film treatment and simon beaufoy wrote the screenplay boyle describes  hours as an action movie with a guy who cant move he also expressed an interest for a more intimate film than his previous film slumdog millionaire  i remember thinking i must do a film where i follow an actor the way darren aronofsky did with the wrestler so  hours is my version of that boyle and fox searchlight announced plans to create  hours in november  and news of the world reported that month that cillian murphy was boyles top choice to play ralston in january  james franco was cast as ralston in march  filming began in utah boyle intended to shoot the first part of the film with no dialogue by  june  the film was in postproduction boyle made the very unusual move of hiring two cinematographers to work first unit anthony dod mantle and enrique chediak each of whom shot  percent of the film by trading off with each other this allowed boyle and franco to work long days without wearing out the crew boyle enlisted makeup effects designer tony gardner and his effects company alterian inc to recreate the characters amputation of his own arm boyle stressed that the realism of the arm as well as the process itself were key to the audiences investing in the characters experience and that the makeup effects success would impact the films success the false arm rigs were created in layers from fiberglass and steel bone through silicone and fibrous muscle and tendon to functional veins and arteries and finally skinned with a translucent silicone layer of skin with a thin layer of subcutaneous silicone fat gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful as he wanted to do justice to the story he credits james franco equally with the success of the effects workcitation needed three prosthetics were used in all with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine  franco admitted that shooting the film was physically hard on him there was a lot of physical pain and danny knew that it was going to cause a lot of pain and i asked him after we did the movie how did you know how far you could push it  i had plenty of scarsnot only am i feeling physical pain but im getting exhausted it became less of a façade i put on and more of an experience that i went through releaseedit  hours was screened at the toronto international film festival on  september  following its premiere at the  telluride film festival the film was selected to close the  london film festival on  october  it was given a limited release in the united states on  november

financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors us million including  million to the us government and  million to

untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department

metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more

the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into

warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former

commission that resulted in goldman paying a  million settlement goldman sachs was excoriated by the press and the public according to journalists mclean and nocera  this despite the nonretail nature

destructive environment in which the interests of the client continue to be sidelined senior management described clients as muppets and colleagues callously talked about ripping their clients off in

supervised release and ordered to pay  million in fines stub month and allegedly misleading results in december edit in april  floyd norris chief financial correspondent of the new york times accused goldman sachs of misleading investors by having puffed up its first quarter  earnings by creating a december orphan month into which it shifted large writedowns so they did not appear in any quarterly number in april  the company reported a  million net loss for the single month of december but reported net earnings of  billion for the first quarter of  however the accounting change to a calendar fiscal year which created the stub month of december  was required when the firm converted to a bank holding company and declared in item  of its form k us securities and exchange commission sec filing of december   the december loss also included a  million marktomarket writedown on loans to chemical maker lyondellbasell since it became clear in december that lyondell would file for bankruptcy protection and would not be able to meet its debt obligations while the results of december  were detailed in the press release reporting the results of december  and the first quarter of  and the related conference call with analysts according to an article in the washington post by david s hilzenrath the company included a page of charts in its monday news release showing its december results but it didnt include a narrative description of those results as it did for the januarythroughmarch period most financial analysts and the mainstream financial press were aware of the required change in fiscal year and deteriorating market conditions into december and were not surprised by the december loss analysts focused more on the first quarter results and the planned repayment of tarp funds but even merrill lynch told its clients not to forget about december merrill lynch took at least  billion of losses in the same period and morgan stanley which was also required to switch to a calendar year for accounting purposes as a result of its conversion to a bank holding company also reported a large loss for its stub month of december although unlike goldman morgan stanley also lost money in the first quarter of  bonuses paid to employees in  despite financial crisisedit in june  after the firm repaid the tarp investment from the us treasury goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance andrew cuomo then new york attorney general questioned goldmans decision to pay  employees bonuses of at least  million each after it received tarp funds in  that same period however ceo lloyd blankfein and  other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses stating they believed it was the right thing to do in light of the fact that we are part of an industry thats directly associated with the ongoing economic distress benefits from the government bailout of aigedit american international group received  billion in government loans during the financial crisis the money was used to repay customers of its securitylending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from aig however due to the size and nature of the payouts there was considerable controversy in the media and amongst some politicians as to whether banks including goldman sachs should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full in full via government loans to aig the new york state attorney general andrew cuomo announced in march  that he was investigating whether aigs trading counterparties improperly received government money goldman sachs was a major beneficiary of the government loans to aig and received  billion during the unwind of credit default swap cds contracts by aig after receiving the government loans firms response to criticism of aig paymentsedit goldman sachs maintained that its net exposure to aig was not material and that the firm was protected by hedges in the form of cdss with other counterparties and  billion of collateral the firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over  million according to goldman both the collateral and cdss would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an aig bankruptcy however because aig was bailed out and not allowed to fail these hedges did not pay out cfo david viniar stated that profits related to aig in the first quarter of  rounded to zero and profits in december were not significant he went on to say that he was mystified by the interest the government and investors have shown in the banks trading relationship with aig considerable speculation remains that goldmans hedges against its aig exposure would not have paid out if aig was allowed to fail according to a report by the united states office of the inspector general of tarp if aig had collapsed it would have made it difficult for goldman to liquidate its trading positions with aig even at discounts and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that might have made it difficult for goldman sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an aig default finally the report said an aig default would have forced goldman sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations goldman argued that cdss are marked to market ie valued at their current market price and their positions netted between counterparties daily thus as the cost of insuring aigs obligations against default rose substantially in the leadup to its bailout the sellers of the cds contracts had to post more collateral to goldman sachs the firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an aig bankruptcy and the risk of knockon defaults had aig been allowed to fail however in practice the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an aig bankruptcy if the government let aig default according to money manager michael lewitt its collapse would be as close to an extinctionlevel event as the financial markets have seen since the great depression september   meetings at the new york federal reserveedit some have said incorrectly according to others that goldman sachs received preferential treatment from the government by being the only wall street firm to have participated in the crucial september meetings at the new york fed which decided aigs fate much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted new york times article the article was later corrected to state that blankfein ceo of goldman sachs was one of the wall street chief executives at the meeting emphasis added bloomberg has also reported that representatives from other firms were indeed present at the september aig meetings furthermore goldman sachs cfo david viniar stated that ceo blankfein had never met with his predecessor and thenus treasury secretary henry paulson to discuss aig however there were frequent phone calls between the two of them paulson was not present at the september meetings at the new york fed morgan stanley was hired by the federal reserve to advise on the aig bailout according to the new york times paulson spoke with the ceo of goldman sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so while it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence particularly in a crisis the times noted he spoke with goldmans blankfein more frequently than with other large banks federal officials say that although paulson was involved in decisions to rescue aig it was the federal reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the aig bailout  million settlement for massachusetts subprime mortgages edit on may   goldman sachs agreed to pay up to  million to end an investigation by the massachusetts attorney generals office into whether the firm helped promote unfair home loans in the state the settlement will be used to reduce the mortgage payments of  massachusetts residents who had secured subprime mortgages funded by goldman sachs michael duvally a spokesman for goldman said it was pleased to have resolved this matter and declined to comment further this settlement may open the door to state government actions against goldman throughout the united states aimed at securing compensation for predatory mortgage lending practices abacus mortgagebacked cdos and  million settlement edit see also merrill lynch § cdo controversies and magnetar capital unlike many investors and investment bankers goldman sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis that developed in  some of its traders became bearish on the housing boom beginning in  and developed mortgagerelated securities originally intended to protect goldman from investment losses in the housing market in late  goldman management changed the firms overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative as the market began its downturn goldman created even more of these securities no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but according to business journalist gretchen morgenson enabling it to pocket huge profits from the mortgage defaults and that goldman used the cdos to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes authors bethany mclean and joe nocera stated that the firms later insistence that it was merely a market maker in these transactions—implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients—became less true over time the investments were called synthetic cdos because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults—the insurance known as credit default swaps goldman and some other hedge funds held a short position in the securities paying the premiums while the investors insurance companies pension funds etc receiving the premiums were the long position the longs were responsible for paying the insurance claim to goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted through april  goldman issued over  cdos in its abacus series worth a total of  billion all together goldman packaged sold and shorted a total of  synthetic cdos with an aggregate face value of  billion between july   and may   but while goldman was praised for its foresight some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure these securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by april  at least us billion worth of the securities either carried junk ratings or had defaulted one cdo examined by critics which goldman bet against but also sold to investors was the  million hudson mezzanine cdo issued in  in the senate permanent subcommittee hearings goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books unable to sell them directly it included them in the underlying securities of the cdo and took the short side but critics mclean and nocera complained the cdo prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as assets sourced from the street making it sound as though goldman randomly selected the securities instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book the cdo did not perform well and by march —just  months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out about us million to goldman and others who had bet against it goldmans head of european fixedincome sales lamented in an email made public by the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations the real bad feeling across european sales about some of the trades we did with clients who had invested in the cdo the damage this has done to our franchise is very significant critics also complain that while goldmans investors were large ostensibly sophisticated banks and insurers at least some of the cdo securities and their losses filtered down to small public agencies—money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets for example an investor in abacus ikb bank created a structured investment vehicle called rhinebridge rhinebridge like other sivs issued debt that it then used to buy mortgagebacked securities and cdos like abacus the debt issued by rhinebridge  was bought by among others king county washington which managed money on behalf of one hundred other public agencies this was money used to run schools and fix potholes and fund municipal budgets   for all of goldmans later claims that it dealt only with the most sophisticated of investors the fact remained that those investors could be fiduciaries investing on behalf of school districts fire departments pensioners and municipalities all across the country ikb paid for its share of the deal with money it collected from a number of relatively unsophisticated investors including king county in washington state in  the county bought us million of commercial paper a type of shortterm debt from rhineland a special fund created by ikb that in turn snapped up nearly us million of the securities created by the goldman vehicle known as abacus ac  king county also made a usmillion purchase  in  from another ikb fund dubbed rhinebridge the county lost us million when rhinebridge collapsed—and an additional us million when other similar funds defaulted about  county agencies in the seattle area including some that deal with libraries and schools saw their budgets cut as a result in public statements goldman claimed that it shorted simply to hedge and was not expecting the cdos to fail it also denied that its investors were unaware of goldmans bets against the products it was selling to them there were intricate links between a goldman sachs trader jonathan m egol synthetic collateralized debt obligations or cdo abacus and assetbacked securities index abx goldman is also alleged to have tried to pressure the credit rating agency moodys give its products a higher rating than they deserved according to an article in propublica goldman and other firms often seemed to have pressured the agencies to give good ratings emails released last week by the senate investigations subcommittee give a glimpse of the backandforth pdf i am getting serious pushback from goldman on a deal that they want to go to market with today wrote one moodys employee in an internal email message in april  the senate subcommittee found that rating decisions were often subject to concerns about losing market share to competitors the agencies are after all paid by the firms whose products they rate  sec civil fraud lawsuitedit in april  the us securities and exchange commission sec charged goldman sachs and one of its vicepresidents fabrice tourre with securities fraud the sec alleged that goldman had told buyers of a synthetic cdo a type of investment that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent cdo manager aca management in fact paulson  co a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a significant role in the selection and the package of securities turned out to become one of the worstperforming mortgage deals of the housing crisis because less than a year after the deal was completed  of the bonds selected for abacus had been downgraded the particular synthetic cdo that the secs  fraud suit charged goldman with misleading investors with was called abacus ac unlike many of the abacus securities ac did not have goldman sachs as a short seller in fact goldman sachs lost money on the deal that position was taken by the customer john paulson who hired goldman to issue the security according to the secs complaint paulson and his employees selected  bbbrated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for paulson and the manager of the cdo aca management worked on the portfolio of  bonds to be insured aca allegedly unaware of paulsons short position coming to an agreement in late february  paulson paid goldman approximately us million for its work in the deal paulson ultimately made a us billion from the short investments the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers these were primarily ikb deutsche industriebank us million loss and the investors and insurers of another us million—aca financial guaranty corp abn amro and the royal bank of scotland the sec alleged that goldman materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents about the financial security including the fact that it had permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market the hedge fund manager paulson  co to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent objective third party aca management the sec further alleged that tourre also misled aca into believing  that paulsons interests in the collateral section sic process were aligned with acas when in reality paulsons interests were sharply conflicting in reply goldman issued a statement saying the secs charges were unfounded in law and fact and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the cdo that it had lost  million that aca selected the portfolio without goldman suggesting paulson was to be a long investor that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller and vice versa as it was not normal business practice for a market maker and that aca was itself the largest purchaser of the abacus pool investing us million goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector rather than from a particular security in the cdo while some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading others believed goldmans defense was strong and the secs case was weak some experts on securities law such as duke university law professor james cox believed the suit had merit because goldman was aware of the relevance of paulsons involvement and took steps to downplay it others including wayne state university law school law professor peter henning noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved even without knowledge of the part played by paulson critics of goldman sachs point out that paulson went to goldman sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank bear stearns who he had asked to build a cdo ira wagner the head of bear stearnss cdo group in  told the financial crisis inquiry commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal paulson was proposing encouraged paulson to pick the worst assets describing bear stearnss reasoning one author compared the deal to a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team goldman claimed it lost  million critics maintain it was simply unable not due to a lack of trying to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted critics also question whether the deal was ethical even if it was legal goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers according to mclean and nocera there were dozens of securities being insured in the cdo—for example another abacus—had  credits from several different mortgage originators commercial mortgagebacked securities debt from sallie mae credit cards etc goldman bought mortgages to create securities which made it far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like new century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgageholders back—which is why the fine print on at least one abacus prospectus warned long investors that the protection buyer goldman may have information including material nonpublic information which it was not providing to the long investors according to an article in the houston chronicle critics also worried that abacus might undermine the position of the us as a safe harbor for the worlds investors and that the involvement of european interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that regions political leaders most notably british prime minister gordon brown who has accused goldman of moral bankruptcy this is in short a big global story  is what goldman sachs did with its abacus investment vehicle illegal that will be for the courts to decide  but it doesnt take a judge and jury to conclude that legalities aside this was just wrong on july   goldman settled out of court agreeing to pay the sec and investors

regarding mortgage investments tourre defense of abacus lawsuitedit the  goldman settlement did not cover charges against goldman vice president and salesman for abacus fabrice tourre tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit which then went to trial in  on august  a federal jury found tourre liable on six of seven counts including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal he was found not liable on the charge that he had deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement senate report on the causes of the financial crisis of edit on april   the united states senates permanent subcommittee on investigations released a page report entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse which described some of the causes of the financial crisis the report alleged that goldman sachs may have misled investors and profited from the collapse of the mortgage market at their expense the chairman of the subcommittee referred the report to the united states department of justice to determine whether goldman executives had broken the law and two months later the manhattan district attorney subpoenaed goldman for relevant information on possible securities fraud but on august  the justice department announced it had decided not to file charges against goldman sachs or its employees for trades made during the subprime mortgage portfolio alleged commodity price manipulationedit see also s commodities boom a provision of the  financial deregulation law the grammleachbliley act allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally in the years since the laws passing goldman sach and other investment banks morgan stanley jpmorgan chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials such as food products zinc copper tin nickel and aluminum some critics such as matt taibbi believe that allowing a company to both control the supply of crucial physical commodities and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets is akin to letting casino owners who take book on nfl games during the week also coach all the teams on sundays goldman sachs commodity index and the – food bubbleedit frederick kaufman a contributing editor of harpers magazine argued in a  article that goldmans creation of the goldman sachs commodity index now the sp gsci helped passive investors such as pension funds mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index these financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange a june  article in the economist defended commodity investors and oil indextracking funds citing a report by the organisation for economic cooperation and development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by indextracking funds also saw price rises during the period aluminum price and supplyedit in a july  article david kocieniewski a journalist with the new york times accused goldman sachs and other wall street firms of capitalizing on loosened federal regulations to manipulate a variety of commodities markets particularly aluminum citing financial records regulatory documents and interviews with people involved in the activities after goldman sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company metro international in  the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories—to make beer cans home siding and other products—went from an average of  weeks to more than  months according to industry records aluminum industry analysts say that the lengthy delays at metro international after goldman took over are a major reason the premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market has doubled since  the price increase has cost american consumers more than  billion from  to  according to former industry executives analysts and consultants the cause of this was alleged to be goldmans ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum—a million and a half tons—in network of  metro international warehouses goldman owns in detroit michigan to avoid hoarding and price manipulation the london metal exchange requires that at least  tons of that metal must be moved out each day goldman has dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum—not to factories but from one warehouse to another—according to the times in august  goldman sachs was subpoenaed by the federal commodity futures trading commission as part of an investigation into complaints that goldmanowned metals warehouses had intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum in december  it was announced that  cases accusing goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase the two investment banks warehousing businesses and the london metal exchange in various combinations—of violating us antitrust laws would be assigned to united states district court for the southern district of new york judge katherine b forrest in manhattan according to lydia depillis of wonkblog when goldman bought the warehouses it started paying traders extra to bring their metal to goldmans warehouses rather than anywhere else the longer it stays the more rent goldman can charge which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium the effect is amplified by another company glencore which is doing the same thing in its warehouse in vlissingen michael duvally a spokesman for goldman sachs said the cases are without merit robert lenzner a columnist at forbes wrote that goldman sachs controls only  of the global market and is therefore too small to have pricing power an article published by bloomberg lp also debunked the conspiracy theory in december  goldman sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to ruben brothers oil futures speculationedit investment banks including goldman have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange in august  confidential documents were leaked detailing the positions in the oil futures market of several investment banks including goldman sachs morgan stanley jpmorgan chase deutsche bank and barclays just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of  the presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets and so the means to significantly sway prices and unlike traditional market participants neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold journalist kate sheppard of mother jones called it a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude however another source stated that just before crude oil hit its record high in mid  of the worlds largest banks were betting that prices would fall according to private trading data in april  a couple of observers—brad johnson of the blog climate progress founded by joseph j romm and alain sherter of cbs moneywatch—noted that goldman sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil climate progress quoted goldman as warning that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation in petroleum futures and that net speculative positions are four times as high as in june  when the price of oil peaked it stated that goldman sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least  higher than supply and demand dictate sherter noted that goldmans concern over speculation did not prevent it along with other speculators from lobbying against regulations by the commodity futures trading commission to establish position limits which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold and thus prevent speculation according to joseph p kennedy ii by  prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by hedge funds and bankers pumping billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price the problem started according to kennedy in  when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the new york mercantile exchange goldman sachs made an argument to the commodity futures trading commission that wall street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades the commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed goldman sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades other exemptions followed and by  eight investment banks accounted for  of the total oil futures market initial public offering kickback bribesedit goldman sachs is accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting documents under seal in a decadelong lawsuit concerning etoyscoms initial public offering ipo in  but released accidentally to the new york times show that ipos managed by goldman were underpriced and that goldman asked clients able to profit from the prices to increase business with it the clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary in order to participate in further such undervalued ipos companies going public and their initial consumer stockholders are both defrauded by this practice unauthorized trades by goldman sachs trader matthew marshall tayloredit former goldman sachs trader matthew marshall taylor was convicted of hiding  billion worth of unauthorized trades involving derivatives on the sp  index by making multiple false entries into a goldman trading system when goldman sachs management uncovered the trades taylor was immediately fired the trades cost the company  million which taylor was ordered to repay in  taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to  months in prison in addition to the monetary damages danish utility sale edit goldman sachss purchase of an  stake

a nerve with the danish public which is still suffering from the aftereffects of the global financial crisis protesters in copenhagen gathered around a banner with a drawing of a vampire squid—the
