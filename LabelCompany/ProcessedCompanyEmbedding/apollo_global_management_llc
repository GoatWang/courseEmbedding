shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world the best use of the pe ratio is to compare the stocks current pe ratio with a where this ratio has been in the past b how it compares to the average for the industrysector and c how it compares to the market as a whole on this front apollo global has a trailing twelve months pe ratio of  as you can see in the chart below this level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large as the pe for the sp  stands at about  if we focus on the longterm pe trend apollo globals current pe level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years further the stocks pe also compares favorably with the zacks classified investment management industrys trailing twelve months pe ratio which stands at  at the very least this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now compared to its peers we should also point out that apollo global has a forward pe ratio price relative to this years earnings of just  so it is fair to say that the stock price might appreciate in future ps ratio another key metric to note is the pricesales ratio this approach compares a given stocks price to its total sales where a lower reading is generally considered better some people like this metric more than other valuefocused ones because it looks at sales something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings right now apollo global has a ps ratio of about  this is lower than the sp

tradingat least compared to historical norms broad value outlook in aggregate apollo global currently has a zacks value style score of a putting it into the top  of all stocks we cover from this look this makes apollo global a solid choice for value investors and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too for example the peg ratio for apollo global is just  a level that is lower than the industry average of  the peg ratio is a modified pe ratio that takes into account the stocks earnings growth rate clearly apo is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles what about

seen two up and three down in the same time period this has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen by  in the past two months while the full year estimate has inched lower by  you can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below apollo global management llc price and consensus apollo global management llc price and consensus  apollo global management llc quote this bearish trend is why the stock has just a zacks rank  hold and why we are looking for inline performance from
