provides maximum reuse of standardized technology that will protect your investment for the long haul making it “future proof” flexibility by providing many system designs with multiple building blocks interoperability driven by modular architecture standardized control plane and advanced software design what led mercury to tackle this type of technology architecture mercury has extensive experience in building and promoting standardized solutions in the world of embedded computing mercury helped establish the now widely adopted embedded computing standard openvpx we helped establish and lead the working group that was formed behind openvpx in january  in june  ansi the standards governing body formally ratified openvpx as a true open architecture and standard in embedded computing within the rf and microwave domain much of the technology supporting ew ea and sigint applications require much the same standardized modular open systems architecture approach applied in embedded computing on top of this consideration the us department of defense has issued directives for some time asking that the defense industrial base employ open system architectures osa wherever possible in short mercury systems has announced openrfm as a first step in building a standardized open system architecture that customers and the dod has been asking for this osa can and will be applied to key ew ea and sigint applications   any other considerations on why mercury has taken the lead with openrfm there is one other very important consideration that is born out of both a desire to lead and also from a requirement to integrate many disparate products over the last  years mercury has acquired several companies within the digital signal processing rf and microwave space starting with arc in the early ’s then echotek in  lnx in  and micronetics in  mercury found itself with several leading rf and microwave technologies and capabilities and the need to bring together integrate make modular and standardize these technologies also mercury could build solutions in a sustainable scalable and affordable way for customers as a company mercury systems has gotten very good at integrating and standardizing rf and microwave solutions this skill set that has been acquired over several years is now applied to customers both prime contractors and the dod need to standardize around an open systems architecture in rf and microwave solutions openrfm takes advantage of mercury’s ability to take several leading technologies and make them work as one without this important skill set it would be nearly impossible to develop the kinds of open affordable standardized solutions that are called for today within the rf and microwave domain is openrfm a standard already no not yet mercury is in the early stages to drive openrfm to becoming a true standard in the meantime mercury systems is already working with select customers on standardized modular solutions that are being applied to key programs that require advanced ew ea and sigint capabilities mercury systems is launching openrfm as a standardized modular approach to rf and microwave solutions that is supported with products and company representatives readily on hand to answer questions as it did with openvpx mercury intends to initiate work and possibly establish a working group to help create an ecosystem and drive adoption of openrfm as a true standard in the meantime the benefits of openrfm and the ability to provide a modular open architecture in the rf and microwave space can be taken full advantage of by customers right away the improvements in affordability driven by this type of technology are not something that is in the distant future mercury has examples of
