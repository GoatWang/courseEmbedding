productsa year old man has  in a  cd in a roth ira account at his bank assuming he is in a  marginal income tax bracket and the cd continues to earn the same interest how much money will the man have at age  the man will have  and if he chooses to cash it in at age  he will pay no income taxes because roth ira accounts are income tax freeanother year old man has  in a  cd in a tax deferred fixed annuity bought at his bank assuming he is in a  marginal income tax bracket and the cd continues to earn the same interest how much money will the man have at age  the man will have  and if he chooses to cash it in at age  he will pay income taxes of  at that time another year old man has  in a regular cd also earning  at his bank he has selected to compound the interest in the account until age  without making any withdrawals assuming he is in the  marginal income tax bracket and the cd continues to earn the same interest how much money will the man have at age although the three men above have the same amount of money at age  their costs to acquire the  in the account were quite different the man with the roth ira faired the best with no income tax costs  the man with the traditional ira faired second best when he paid an income tax cost of  the man with the regular cd who compounded his interest had the most cost while he paid  in income taxes they were not paid out in one sum at age  rather taxes were paid out incrementally each year as the interest was earned therefore one must use the time value of money to calculate true costs assuming an aftertax investment rate of  for the time value of money purposes this man loses  in taxes plus  in lost earnings on those taxes in other words if a person pays income taxes sooner than later it has a higher cost the cost of compounding the income taxes paid out over  years  is actually  in this example  one may ask what if the third man paid the income taxes from the regular cd account each year netting instead of compounding the interest he would have faired better the man would have  at age  but he would also have avoided the time value of money cost of  that the man compounding the interest experienced therefore of the four possible ways to accumulate longterm savings tax free tax deferred and netting are all less costly than taxable compound interest this fact is generally true regardless of the interest rate and tax rate assumptions used the leap system® may help you eliminate some or all of the financial costs associated with owning a taxable compound interest account while still maintaining its benefits leap uses a unique cash flow money strategy to help accomplish these goals     leap systems inc no part of this page may be reproduced abstracted excerpted transmitted in any

dollar cost averagingback to strategies and productsdollar cost averaging is a popular way for people to average out the cost of their investments over time when prices are high they buy fewer shares when prices are lower they buy more shares however one must recognize that a dollarcostaveraging strategy does not by itself provide for risk management of the assets against market risk death disability or creditor protection therefore one may need to protect the dollar cost averaging assets from these potential eroding factors by using the cash flow money concepts and strategies utilized in the leap system® one may build in these most important protection elementsnote any periodic investment plan does not assume a profit or protect against losses in declining markets dollar cost averaging involves continuous investment in securities regardless of the fluctuation price of such securities investors should carefully consider their financial ability to continue their investments

understood is that this savings may come at the expense of paying more income taxes and experiencing lost opportunity costs on the extra payments which may result in costs greater than the loan interest savings the estimated total cost to the consumer is rarely explained or calculated by many financial institutions while the interest saved is always shown consumers should be careful to

insurance it is generally recognized as the best strategy in the longrun not to have low deductibles since premiums are generally higher for the low deductible coverage this increased premium cost may

minors  back to strategies and productsleap systems inc has found that special gifting accounts for minors may not be the best overall strategy for funding college education capital for the few dollars it may save in income taxes the restrictions and lost opportunity costs can potentially be significant restrictions on the availability of money and the loss of protection against death disability and future income taxes make this strategy a weaker choice for most consumers than other more productive choices a program that pays little or no income taxes maintains control over the assets potentially keeps the assets out of the hands of creditors and completes the plan in the event of death or disability would be superior consumers should consider all of the alternatives for funding college tuition and other costs before selecting special gifting accounts for minorsthe leap® process provides a complete and comprehensive approach to college education funding techniques

productsthe leap® process can show you why in many cases a taxdeferral strategy may be ineffective for wealth building and protection opportunities taxdeferral strategies may not avoid income taxes but only postpone them or actually cause a larger tax later if ones marginal tax bracket increases one should also consider reducing or avoiding income taxes as an effective financial strategy than just postponing taxes in addition many consumers are never provided any information about the potential estate distribution and estate conservation problems of a taxdeferred asset strategy or programall of the benefits and potential disadvantages of a taxdeferral strategy or product should be evaluated before its implementation every consumer needs to review other alternatves with the same outlay before allocating any dollars to a taxdeferral program it may be that a taxdeferral program makes sense and is the best alternative but until a comparison with a fully intergated program is provided one may not come to the conclusion that a taxdeferred program is always best      leap systems inc no part of this page may be reproduced abstracted excerpted transmitted in any form by any

invest the difference back to strategies and productsterm life insurance plays an important role in protecting individuals businesses and families from the premature death of a breadwinner or key person in many instances term life insurance is chosen because of its apparent low cost like most things in life if something is low cost there usually is a reason contrary to the public understanding a longterm strategy of buy term and invest the difference can have significant costs to the insured and the ultimate beneficiariesthe leap system® helps consumers understand that term life premiums and its lost opportunity cost can be very expensive over the life expectancy of any consumer who employs such a strategy the potential loss of the death benefit of the term life policy may leave the invested difference account vulnerable to income taxes estate taxes market declines and liquidity problemsalthough term life insurance plays an important role in many financial situations one must consider all of the factors associated with the cost of the premiums over time the potential loss of the earnings on those premiums and the ultimate possible loss of the death benefit if the term life policy has expired and the stock market is perhaps in a downward cycle at the time of the ultimate death the effects of this strategy can be financially damaging to heirsfor a more complete understanding of this subject this approach educates consumers on all aspects of various forms of life insurance coverages no particular type of policy is uniformly the best in all circumstances each type of insurance policy must be evaluated and selected in an appropriate evaluation process such as the leap system     leap systems inc no part of this page may be reproduced abstracted excerpted

payroll deduction of series eee bonds by employees in corporate america has been a popular way to forced savings for the future no one can deny the value these bonds have contributed to many americans over the years for certain investors these bonds have great appealthere are features of these financial products that need explanation for the overall understanding these financial instruments earn what is called phantom income that is they accrue interest rather than currently paying it out the consumers inability to use this income or interest during the bond holding period prevents the use of the interest for other financial needs wants and desires that they may have therefore one may lose the opportunity to build additional wealth or protect those assets from eroding factorsmoney that is idle may be less productive than money that is being used for other financial needs and objectives one should assess the advantage of receiving a benefit from one financial product and weigh it

financial arsenal for this purpose unfortunately at the same time many people overlook the disadvantages and fail to protect their hard earned money leap systems inc explains that for many americans these taxdeferred strategies may contain problems due to their inability to prevent eventual large income tax payments estate taxes and potential losses due to market fluctuationsince these accounts are usually longterm in nature inflation market fluctuation and taxation can significantly reduce the purchasing value of the accounts americans may lose considerable amounts of their account values because they may not have been made aware of the possible economic dangers both before and after retirement or deathin order to be most effective these accounts need to be properly structured and coordinated and integrated with other financial strategies and products in order to protect them otherwise the accounts will always be vulnerable to possible losses one must make sure that their

they may be identical in cost in order to get the cheaper loan interest rate you have to pay a higher premium for the monthly payment if one took the difference in the payment and invested it into an ira roth ira paid off credit cards or put it into a guaranteed annuity there is a good chance that they would have more money at the end of the year period no guarantees of course but one needs to consider the alternativesfor a large percentage of american consumers the net cost of a year mortgage is greater than a year mortgage given similar or even lower interest rates although one can save actual interest costs with a year mortgage after considering the income taxes paid and the lost opportunity costs on the invested difference in monthly payments a year mortgage may actually be cheaper in the long runa year mortgage may still be paid off in years and potentially still have more money left over compared to a year mortgage if the difference in monthly payments had actually been faithfully saved in a conservative alternative in addition the lower monthly payments of a year mortgage versus the higher monthly payments of a year mortgage may provide the consumer with more safety

debt back to strategies and productshigh nondeductible interest costs makes using credit cards for loans a serious wealth eroder there is no doubt that in our fast paced society credit cards are a

insurance policies have a low premium in the early years at older ages the premiums increase and can become very expensive and in some cases prohibitive when term life insurance policies expire or are cancelled their overall cost to the insured and beneficiaries is made up of the following factors total premiums paid plus the potential earnings lost on the premium payments plus the loss of the

every investment product works effectively the longer one holds it given equal rates of return assumptions the potential management fees income taxes lost opportunity costs inflation and estate taxes can substantially reduce or negate much of the growth some investments create in the long run these facts may necessitate the use of other cash flow techniques in the planning process in order to protect any investments from these potential eroding factors most investments have choices as to what to do with dividends capital gains and interest the leap system® can show you how to coordinate and integrate these choices to help protect the investments from income taxes estate taxes creditors and other eroding factorsnote investments involve market risk including fluctuating returns and

life insurance is a product used mostly for estate tax planning purposes where estates are large but illiquid this financial tool can be effective for raising necessary funds to conserve the estate from taxation many attorneys and cpas recommend this type product for the estate tax purpose and usually recommend that it be placed into an irrevocable life insurance trust survivorship life works best for ages  and overhowever for ages  and over survivorship life insurance may have some serious consequences for the insured and their heirs that sometimes get overlooked one such risk is whereby one spouse lives to or beyond life expectancy since the policy doesnt pay until the second of the spouses to die such a long time frame may reduce the advantage of the death benefit as an effective way to pay the estate taxa more serious consequence may occur when one spouse dies at an early age example age  and the other spouse lives to an old age example age  the loss of not paying a death benefit on the first spouses death has a large lost opportunity cost to the eventual heirs in either of the two cases just mentioned a significant portion of the estate assets may be lost for the heirs these losses occur because the future value of the premium payments andor death benefits not paid out at the first death may be equal to or greater than the value of the death benefit these costs should always be explained and clearly calculated to consumers before considering survivorship life insurance as an estate planning strategythe leap® process offers consumers many choices in the
