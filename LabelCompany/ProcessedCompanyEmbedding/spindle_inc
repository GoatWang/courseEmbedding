some real growth  payments as the core of a meteoric rise airbnb has built its reputation as a new kind of hospitality business in the sharing economy but maybe it should get recognition for payments innovation as well the company has changed the way many consumers book their travel accommodations but it’s actually built its infrastructure around payments unlike many other platforms the company decided to process its own payments inhouse shortly after opening for business in a recent interview kapil mokhat the company’s director of payments and partnerships told pymnts that having a customized payments processing engine has helped the company’s rapid expansion“from  to now the growth at airbnb has been incredible and it hasn’t been a marketbymarket approach — it’s really grown and spread in every direction with that challenge in front of us we needed to be able to rethink how to approach payments in a way that worked for us” he said “that doesn’t mean we haven’t partnered

opinions expressed by forbes contributors are their ownkrossover founder vasu kulkarni says his companys exit is a pretty good sign for the sports tech world photo by grant lamos ivgetty images for awxiisports video analysis and statistics company krossover has been acquired by dallasbased blue star sports a company linked to dallas cowboys owner jerry jones and focused on building sports management software the acquisition comes after krossover an eight year old company has raised over  million through a variety of rounds of fundingkrossover founder vasu kulkarni thinks that the deal is especially notable because there are very few true sports technology exitsits one of the reasons why in general venture capitalists are a little worried about investing in the space explains kulkarni not that this is an instagram exit but it is special for a company in new york that raised decent money to have a decent exit and be one of the true sports tech companies to exit outside of a media entity like bleacher report its a pretty good sign for the sports tech world and generally a good sign considering how much money has been spent in this space in the past few yearskulkarni remembers that when he first went out to raise money he could not get a dime especially from usbased investors now he laughs about the fact that he could not get anyone in america to take sports analytics seriously that was advertisinginread invented by teadsthere were never institutional guys willing to get behind us recalls kulkarni it was always team owners or people related to game of basketball or football who understood itbut those individuals who understood kulkarnis concept to provide a webbased video indexing platform are pretty prominent in the world of sports they include cleveland cavaliers owner dan gilbert former nba player david robinson and miami dolphins owner stephen ross all of whom in krossovers series b round of fundingand then came blue star sports at a very important timeif blue star hadnt come around eighteen months ago with rob wechsler who is a rock star and has sold multiple companies in the past i dont think a big private equity group would back someone with  million from day one to go on an acquisition spree says kulkarni who else has enough capital to make this type of purchase in this spacerecommended by forbesmost popular photos the richest person in every state views samsung leak reveals massive galaxy note sapvoice going digital five things to considerblue star sports was a fit for krossover when kulkarni did not see many others aroundi think that people dont think you can get a return here says kulkarni about the sports tech space theyre not entirely wrong it is certainly a difficult space to make moneyfortunately for kulkarni and his team who will be sticking around at krossover they never had to worry about replacing blue star sports which reached out to kulkarni roughly eighteen months ago right when blue star sports was getting startedtheyre a private equity group and we were kind of like were not a private equity backable company at this point or one that people will buy    we are still in startup mode and still not profitable explains kulkarni but they came back to us earlier this year after they raised more money from genstar capital and said they think we would really be able to help drive revenue for all these other businesses because video is driving so much revenue in sportsin exchange for the sale kulkarni and his team will receive a mix of cash and stock he says that the amount of overlap between krossover and blue star sports companies is crazy and if everything goes according to plan then it will be a very good exit for investors and founders but that there exist a lot of variable componentsif things dont go as well then it will be an okay exit and we will all make out alright adds kulkarnidarren heitner the founder of south floridabased heitner legal pllc and sports

of late with low trading volumes again might be that folks are waiting on q report that is due out by monday may th as well as the promised shareholder update mentioned in the sathianathan news report i would expect that with all the effort put forth to get the  annual report out that the stage would be set to have a timely q  filing but no guarantees with spdl shareholder letter likely will come out with the q report or a day or so later as has been their practice in the past i would not expect much in the way of revenue in q as with only  full time employees not much infrastructure to run a business engine without a lot of rd party support staff we will see in my view spdl has built a payments transactional engine  platform with some valuable boltons that has advantages and may simply be

merchants are struggling with personalization nearly half of respondents said it’s important for retailers to consider their browsing history and online purchases when customizing marketing for them§  more interactive search methods top consumers’ wish lists one in five consumers are interested in using voice or photo search but not a single top  retailer extended either option to shoppers through primary ecommerce sites§  limited site search capabilities are degrading the customer experience the vast majority of retailers relied heavily on basic keyword terms to itemize search results and didn’t accurately guess what a shopper might be looking for based on browsing history onethird of retailers’ search bars utilized visuals with product thumbnails in suggested results as shoppers typed a querymorereplymmishagoogle the guy quoted in yesterday from covercake pr brian sathianathan big name in bay area vc community not a bad guy to have in company corner or ours as shareholder u dont
