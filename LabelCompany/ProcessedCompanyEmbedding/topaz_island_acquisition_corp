board leaders posted on may    leave a comment this is part two of a series read part one the ascent of activist investors and the need to adapt to boardtoinvestor communications are producing drastic changes in the way companies interact with their shareholders question  institutional investors are demanding more process and access to board leaders traditionally companies have avoided this at all costs is that still an appropriate strategy lex suvanto  companies are actively thinking about how best to leverage their directors as part of their shareholder communications strategy traditionally board members and companies have been averse to doing this at all there have always been exceptions such as when ceo succession or leadership compensation were in question but now companies in all

the directors are most relevant and helpful for jason m halper  there are at least a couple of issues to keep in mind when companies are considering how best to approach board engagement if you’re talking about the us and a public company you need to be careful about disclosing material nonpublic information in the course of those communications because of sec regulation fair disclosure rules whoever is doing the engagement needs to have a very clear sense of which information is and is not permissible to disclose if you’re going to disclose nonpublic information you need a confidentiality agreement from the shareholder as for outside directors they are not going to be as familiar with the daytoday activities of the company so you would generally want to limit them to areas they’re familiar with – things like corporate governance executive compensation perhaps high level strategy chris ruggieri  if you go back  years we would routinely refer to institutional investors as “passive” the reality today is that there is no such thing as a passive investor it has always been important for companies to be engaged with their owners and to stimulate interest and demand and we’re seeing more of that the advice i give our clients is that it is imperative for you to have a constructive relationship with your investors you should have a regular calendar of interactions with them and you should be listening closely to gather their input you should be trying to find out if there are any misperceptions about the company or its stock to understand if there is any misalignment in terms of expectations and to get a general sense of their sentiment about how you’re running the company and their level of satisfaction i think the one area where debate continues is when it comes to who is responsible for interacting with shareholders what we’re hearing from investors is that they want more direct access to csuite executives and some investors are asserting that the board should play a role in shareholder engagement even though that’s not a routine board responsibility increasingly we’ve seen letters from vanguard and other large institutions regarding expectations of board engagement and board participation i think we’re going to continue to have that discussion until we find a point of equilibrium where investors are satisfied with the level of board interaction and companies and board directors feel comfortable and confident that it’s the right balance       share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in investor relations the ins and outs of preparing for an ipo phase two b posted on may    leave a comment this is the fifth in a series of posts the ins and outs of preparing for an ipo what your company needs to know  phase ii – executing an ipo   corporate governance and a board of directors all of the major stock exchanges require a registrant to have a majority of independent directors on its board according to pwc “…one of the best sources of objective advice can come from an independent or outside director” as with every other element of the ipo journey a company should seek qualified board members well in advance of the ipo launch “a potential board member who is unfamiliar with a company may be reluctant to join the board immediately before an ipo since a director has personal liability for information contained in or omitted from the registration statement” pwc adds ey’s guide to going public survey revealed that recruiting qualified independent board members was the greatest corporate governance issue faced during the ipo process choosing an investment bank of all the external advisory professionals involved in an ipo the underwriter is potentially the most important while no company is obligated to use an underwriter to go to market garnering their expertise has its advantages an investment bank can ensure an ipo will be properly managed and successfully marketed investment banks also have an instinct for timing an issue and they can often anticipate pitfalls and calculate risks the size and scope of a company and its offering will in part determine the size of the underwriter it will need to enlist for its ipo for more on the ipo process listen to the complete webinar here other characteristics to look for when choosing investment bankers include the candidate’s likeability communication style and trustworthiness it is also important to find an investment banker that specializes in businesses or industry segments similar to that of the ipo candidate and one that has proven experience in underwriting ipos regulatory compliance the financial healthcheck according to kpmg the process of going public will necessitate a fundamental shift in financial reporting and planning ipo candidates will need to comply with the local regulatory requirements for their respective exchange in the us this means compliance with both the federal sarbanes–oxley act and local us gaap accounting practices sarbanesoxley requires a registrant’s management ceo and cfo to provide certifications in periodic filings with the sec and to have an independent audit committee with at least one member qualified as a financial expert any public company will need a suite of boardapproved risk management and control policies companies in today’s business environment are focusing more on risk assessment and response as a result of increased regulatory and investor scrutiny shareholders are also increasingly expecting transparency open communication and effective global risk management enhancing internal controls can help meet evolving tax legal accounting and procedural challenges establishing an internal audit committee is key to meeting these requirements audit committees typically examine the annual and quarterly financial reports and review the financial reporting and budgeting processes   share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin

and trends posted on may     comment management teams are facing a formidable new challenge in the growing ranks of activist investors expectations for shareholder dialogue have also risen how can companies meet these new demands activist investors have officially reached rockstar status carl icahn whose tactics strike fear into csuite executives worldwide has  twitter followers the pronouncements of bill ackman head of activist fund pershing square are chronicled almost daily by the press indeed the likes of icahn and ackman are in the lead of a growing movement veteran activists such as them are increasingly being joined by firsttimers in   campaigns were waged by new activists according to the wall street journal representing a  increase from a year earlier activists can bring innovation and discipline yet companies are often caught offguard by their approach leading to major disruptions in their strategic plans in order to prepare adequately firms must assume that an activist could enter the picture at any time learning the new language of shareholders  preparation means being proactive with communication efforts and constantly engaging in dialogue with investors both current and prospective individual and institutioned to this end improvements in technology have allowed companies to reach stakeholders faster and with greater ease speeding up the process   as these trends take shape we’ve interviewed five experts to discuss how shareholder communications practices are changing these experienced professionals give insights into how to respond to activist campaigns how best to grant access to board members and what to keep in mind as companies prepare for a new rule regarding ceo compensation the ascent of activist investors and the need to adapt to boardtoinvestor communications are producing drastic changes in the way companies interact with their shareholders question  what trends legal or otherwise are you noting that have affected shareholder communications kai haakon e liekefett  the overall trend which has been going on for many years is shareholder activism this is clearly having an effect on the way companies go about shareholder communications probably forever about  years ago companies and boards were not very focused on shareholder communications – it was more a boardcentric world but the entire system in the us has changed to a more shareholdercentric world one especially noteworthy development is a change in companies’ governance structures most companies used to have a corporate secretary in charge of corporate governance and then they had the investor relations ir officer in the past they did not work together very much but this has been changing dramatically for the last couple of years there is a widespread realization in particular at largecap companies that the corporate secretary and ir officer need to work handinhand because when you’re dealing primarily with large institutional investors as your shareholder base and they are all focused on corporate governance you need to make sure that the left hand understands what the right hand is doing lex suvanto  i think the most serious trend happening now is what i would call the “uberization” of industry there are many industries undergoing profound change – digital industries first and foremost but also the automobile industry the media industry and just about any other industry that is being upended by significant innovation their business models are being called into question as new entrants create a different future for a sector that is putting significant pressure on industry incumbents to talk about their strategy and about how they’re going to continue to grow despite the ubers of the world coming in and paving new ground for themselves a related trend to consider is the drive by companies to cultivate more longterm shareholders the focus is turning away from shortterm shareholders and companies are contemplating how to talk more about longterm strategy – longer than just one or two years this raises questions about whether companies should provide guidance especially longterm guidance which is often difficult given the lack of visibility into the distant future and a third trend is the impact of macroeconomic volatility on the way companies communicate with their investors in january when we had pretty severe market volatility it caused companies to emphasize the resilience of their models and to think again about the debt side of the business rather than just the equity story the markets have leveled off somewhat since january but we saw how macroeconomic concerns can drive the content of shareholder communications john viglotti  one notable trend has to do with the proxy – companies are spending more effort and more money to create engaging materials around their proxy oftentimes the proxy will include color graphs and charts because companies want to emphasize certain proxy issues with investments by contrast many companies’ annual reports now have zero color – it’s all just blackandwhite text with doddfrank and other sec regulations there is also more and more information required to be included in the proxy especially in terms of executive compensation and analysis at the same time every company takes an individual approach to its communications strategy there are a lot of companies that are “just compliant” – they follow the letter of the law in terms of how they communicate with shareholders and not really telling the story of the company where they’re going or why you should be investing in them in contrast there are other companies that are focused not just on communicating with current shareholders but also on attracting prospective investors they are interested in telling a story a vision and they’re more frequent communicators so instead of just sending a press release every quarter around their earnings they may be sending  press releases chris ruggieri  over the last several years there has been a fundamental change in the relationship between public companies and their owners one aspect of that change is related to regulations and governance the dodd frank law’s “say on pay” rule for instance is a regulatory change that has emboldened investors to speak their minds directly about executive compensation we’ve also seen an increase in proxy access – this issue is being hotly debated in the industry another key area is the emergence of new asset classes most notably activist hedge funds up through  activist hedge funds were one of the bestperforming asset classes and activists have been very bold in making assertions about how companies should be managed and how capital should be deployed the rise of activism was driven in part by the financial crisis which made investors seek more direct engagement with the companies in which they’re invested the last key area i would mention is the information technology revolution the advent of the internet and mobile technology has made it easier than ever for investors to communicate with one another as a consequence companies have lost some degree of control over the dissemination of information the velocity and transparency of information have never been higher jason m halper  on the investment side i think we’re seeing an acceleration of trends that have been around for a couple of years now those include an increase in assets under management of activist hedge funds an increase in the success rates of activists depending on how you define success and a shortening of the time periods from when an activist comes on the scene until the end of a campaign on the corporate side you’re seeing more firms adopting formal protocols for shareholder engagement when it comes to director engagement these protocols could address what permissible topics are the process by which a shareholder can request dialogue steps for preparing a director to engage in dialogue and particularly specifying which directors are tasked with engaging in that dialogue you’re also seeing increased engagement by institutional shareholders who represent the third leg of that stool if you will they are much more active and vocal about things such as corporate governance and executive compensation and much more willing to engage with both activists and

growth mergers  acquisitions news how topaz will make couchetard a better companywhat does ceo hannasch see as the “real prize”by  greg lindenberg editor csp december   dublin ireland  alimentation couchetard inc’s acquisition of topaz energy ltd in ireland offers insights into the canadabased retail giant’s goals on a global scale “we’re on a journey as a company to become the world’s preferred destination for convenience and fuel” brian hannasch ceo of couchetard said during the press conference on the deal“that doesn’t mean ‘big’ to usit means truly ‘preferred’” he said “we looked at what topaz was doing here in ireland not only when they launched the topaz brand and restore they are on a journey to become preferred with the irish consumerintroducing food healthier products differentiated products for the consumers in ireland we share a very similar dreamto differentiate our products make the visit easy and provide great customer service we share a lot of the same dna on our journey to becoming the preferred brand”hannasch offered some background on the deal“we’ve been looking at ireland for six years” he said “topaz is the premiere operator in the country and we’re all about thatacquiring great companies and great management teams that are winning and investing in their stores and winning with the customers we’re here to help further that journey”the transaction which the companies announced last week also includes topaz’s recent acquisition of the esso ireland subject to eu competition bureau approval the companies anticipate that the closing will be in february or early marchdublinbased topaz now has  gas stations including those in the esso network of these stations  are owned by topaz and  by dealersthe irish times estimated the deal to be worth  million euros  million us“it’s a truly monumental day for topaz” emmet o’neill topaz ceo said at the press conference “the last few years have been a period of transformation and we’ve grown from an organization that was challenged that was weak and that had an uncertain future into a business which is the no  operator in the countryextremely well invested well branded and well respected and we’re now going further to actually joining the world’s no  fuel and retail convenience operator that is also well branded well invested and strong so it’s a great marriage we realize we’re the junior partner in the marriage but we’re actually thrilled to become part of the couchetard family”as part of couchetard’s recently announced global brand initiative topaz will be rebranded as circle k“we have declared that our global brand is circle k” said hannasch “we have told the topaz team that will be the brand on the stores we have to figure out the fuel brand quite honestly we’ve got a large dealer network very independent operators … so we have to work that out with local management to what is the right strategy from a fuel standpoint in ireland and from an esso standpoint i think we have the right to use that brand for some period of time”couchetard bought statoil fuel  retail in  for  billion with a promise for more european expansion “three and a half years later we’re very impressed with the operations of our team here in europe” he said “we’ve done a lot of sharing of best practices and learned from each other and today we’ve got that platform ready to grow certainly the topaz deal is a big first step in that journey to grow across europe”couchetard has never shied away from acquisitions over the years “but we certainly believe we are more than just an acquisition story” said hannasch “we focus on convenience and fuel we have  employees so it’s a lot about people doing the right things everyday with the customer and we focus back on reinvesting in the stores and investing in the people we think there’s a great opportunity to continue the journey that started here with topaz in the last couple years”he continued “we’re here ireland to win but we pride ourselves on being very global and we recognize that the irish consumer is different than the indiana consumer where i’m from or quebec or oslo so we learn we adapt locally we use local management there will not be a team of north americans or scandinavians coming here it’s very much about an irish team an irish consumer and we’ll share in what we do well learn what topaz does well and become a better company for it we’re in a very local business most of our customers live within a very small radius of our stores we understand that so our mission is to act as locally as we can”at the press conference jacob schram couchetard’s group president for europe added “threeandahalf years after couchetard acquired statoil it is the best that could happen to these companies we have now joined a global familya very strong financial familyand a company that is  dedicated to convenience and fuel … it is very good at benchmarking at sharing best practices sharing best ideas locally but also understanding what we could do globally to be even stronger but now united no longer as cousins but now as brothers and sisters within the common brand circle k we have a lot of passion for that our task now is to include topaz i know them because they were a part of statoil in  we are coming back to a very good companyeven better very strong””we’re very much here to learn” hannasch said “one thing company founder alain bouchard has taught us along the way is there’s a lot of good ideas out there … we make it a point to learn from each and every acquisition”he concluded “we’re very optimistic that there are synergies on the cost side supply chain fuel side and most importantly on the intellectual sidethe sharing of best practices and ideas from other countries and from our experiences here and vice versa that’s where the real prize is”laval quebecbased couchetards network includes  convenience stores in north america including  stores offering fuel its north american

investment decision a potential investor should read the following summary together with the more detailed information regarding the company and the common stock being sold in this offering including “risk factors” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus   the company   history   diverse development group inc the company or ddg a delaware corporation is a company that is in the business of developing and purchasing real estate across all spectrums of the industry throughout the united states the company intends to focus on credit tenant development and acquisitions utilizing a strong balance of holding and selling projects the company will be using the cash raised from the sale of shares to implement its business plan the company is a real estate development and investment company that will build a strong portfolio of investmentgrade retail and commercial leasing properties through acquisition and the pursuit of opportunistic ground up land developments the company intends to utilize market research to diversify its assets nationwide and responsibly optimize its portfolio against risk furthermore the company is seeking external capital from investors the company will operate with little to no debt and hopes to be traded on the otcqb   the company was incorporated in the state of delaware in april  and was formerly known as topaz island acquisition corporation in may  topaz island acquisition corporation filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on form  by which it became a public reporting company   in december  the company implemented a change of control by redeeming shares of existing shareholders issuing shares to new shareholders electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors in connection with the change of control the shareholders of the company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the company’s name from topaz island acquisition corporation to diverse development group inc   business   the companys primary objective is to buy sell and develop real estate assets located within the united states however unlike traditional real estate investment groups ddg intends to operate using cash and little to no debt should the company at any time require debt financing to fulfill its business plan the company shall target shortterm loans only   the companys philosophy is that by using cash for the companys endeavors and by utilizing a development and purchase model using a blend of existing assets with stabilized cash flows and groundup development projects ddg will be able to amass and sustain a strong cash flow with no debt all while maintaining significant assets on the companys books the company also aims to keep overhead low and limit expenses as they relate to soft costs   the company intends to utilize funds pooled from investors to directly invest in incomeyielding properties the company will primarily invest in diversified credit tenant investmentgrade nnn properties with longterm leases the company’s strategic roadmap includes it investing   of its capital for higher return groundup land development projects income will be largely generated from rent and capital gains from development projects the company will not have any debt other than an occasional short term loan that is projectspecific the company’s purchase of existing investmentgrade credit tenant properties should be completed within the first two quarters of total capitalization generating the cash flow and liquidity needed to continue operations      table of contents    risks and uncertainties facing the company   as a development stage company the company has limited operating history and has continuously experienced losses since its inception the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern that is the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has no prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale   one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to raise adequate capital to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations which it had not been able to accomplish to the date of the report and or obtain additional financing from its stockholders andor other third parties   due to financial constraints the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for continued operations it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed   due to these and other factors the company’s need for additional capital the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   trading market   currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board   the offering   the maximum number of shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of this offering is  the offering will terminate twentyfour  months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier terminated by the company   this prospectus relates to the offer and sale of  shares “shares” of common stock of the company as follows a  shares offered by the holders thereof the “selling shareholder shares” who are deemed to be statutory underwriters the selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of  per share   common stock outstanding before the offering                 common stock for sale by selling shareholders                  common stock outstanding after the offering                  offering price     per share             proceeds to the company          based on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this prospectus      table of contents    risk factors   a purchase of any shares is an investment in the companys common stock and involves a high degree of risk investors should consider carefully the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part before the purchase of any shares if any of the following risks actually occur the business financial condition or results of operations of the company would likely suffer the market price of the common stock would likely decline and investors could lose all or a portion of their investment the company has listed the following risk factors which it believes to be that material to an investment decision in this offering   the company has limited operating history and as such an investor cannot assess its profitability or performance but must rely on the experience of its chief executive officer and other officers forming its management team   the company is a development stage company and has limited operating history and it is therefore difficult for an investor to assess prior performance or determine whether it likely that the company will meet its projected business plan an investor will be required to make an investment decision based primarily on recent developing operations on management’s history and on projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered management believes that it is has formulated a business model with sufficient detail and associated expertise to result in a highly successful business venture however there can be no assurance that the company will succeed in its business plans and generate significant revenues   an investment in the company requires a longterm commitment with no certainty of return   it is anticipated that there will be a significant period of time before the company has completed its investments in ground up development projects and each investment may not be liquidated for one to two years after the initial purchase losses on unsuccessful investments may be realized before gains on successful investments are realized dispositions of such investments may require a lengthy time period while it is the intention of the company to achieve target returns over such period other factors such as overall economic conditions the competitive environment and the availability of potential acquirers may shorten or lengthen ddgs holding period therefore it is unlikely that the company will realize substantial gains during its early years   public market risk   it is impossible to predict the price at which units of the company will trade and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the units will be sustained the units will not necessarily trade at values determined solely by reference to the value of the properties of the company accordingly the units may trade at a premium or a discount to the value implied by the value of the properties of ddg the market price for the units may be affected by changes in general market conditions fluctuations in the markets for equity securities and numerous other factors beyond the control of ddg   the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the companys ability to continue as a going concern   in their audited financial report the company’s independent auditors have issued added an explanatory paragraph that unless the company is able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations andor obtain additional financing there is a substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern the company anticipates that it would need substantial capital over the next  months to continue as a going concern to expand its operations in accordance with its current business plan   the company has accumulated deficit as of september   of    as of september   the company has an accumulated deficit of  this deficit may impact on the company in various ways including but not limited to making it more difficult to borrow money sell stock or to maintain a good market price      table of contents    prior investments no indication of future performance   the past investment performance of the company its founder andor its officers cannot be relied upon as an indication of the companys future performance or success that information is solely intended to illustrate the experience of the company and its management and the type of transactions the company intends to pursue on behalf of ddg those transactions are not intended to be complete or representative of all the transactions in which the company its founder andor its officers have been involved   risk of limited number of investments   although the company intends to achieve diversification of investments the company could deploy its capital in a relatively small number of investments the company may also be less diversified should it raise less capital than anticipated accordingly unfavorable performance by a small number of investments could have a substantial adverse impact on the returns realized by investors in the company   potential difficulty consummating attractive investments   the business of identifying and structuring projects of the nature contemplated by the company is highly competitive ddg will be competing for projects with other acquirers there can be no assurance that the company will be able to invest its capital on terms favorable to the company or in comparison to its competitors it is possible that the company will never be fully invested if insufficient quality projects are available or identified   general risks associated with investment in real estate   the investments of the company will be subject to the risks generally incident to ownership of real property including but not limited to uncertainty of cash flow to meet fixed and other obligations adverse changes in local employment conditions interest rates and real estate tax rates changes in fiscal policies and uninsured losses and other risks that are beyond the control of the company there can be no assurance of profitable operations because the cost of owning real estate assets may exceed the income produced particularly since certain expenses related to real estate and its development and ownership such as property taxes utility costs maintenance costs and insurance tend to increase over time and are largely beyond the control of the owner   investments in real estate development projects   a decision to invest in land or buildings for development will be made based upon certain assumptions about the cost of development time periods for completion of various phases of development and the market value of the developed product while there may be past development or operating history on which to base these assumptions many factors may change resulting in such assumptions being untrue such conditions may contribute to reduced demand for the finished product due to competition economic factors or default or changes in the capital markets such as interest rates or the availability of capital to the extent development costs are financed an investment will be subject to real estate financing risks building construction or site development entails risk related to materials and labor cost increases work stoppages or delays regulatory delays failure of performance or defective materials or workmanship by contractors and suppliers unforeseen weather and unforeseen land conditions such risks can be mitigated to some extent by obtaining performance bonds construction and development guaranties letters of credit andor liens on assets under construction no assurance can be given however that any of the foregoing will be obtained or if obtained will be adequate to cover any loss resulting from any such risks   investments in industrial or commercial assets   investments in industrial or other commercial office properties involve certain risks in addition to those which exist for real estate properties generally including certain environmental risks the financial failure and resulting lease default of a tenant which occupies a material amount of space at a commercial property would cause a reduction in the cash flow to the company moreover such reduction could have the effect of decreasing the value of the property in the event of such a termination there can be no assurance that the company would be able to find a replacement tenant to occupy the space on similar terms and it is probable that the costs incurred to renovate and prepare the space to meet the needs of a replacement tenant would be significant it is also possible that such reductions in cash flow could result in the company to default on the mortgage financing secured by the property industrial and commercial office properties are also subject to competition from providers of similar or alternative space competitors may be able to supply space of similar or superior value at prices equal to or lower than those charged by the company or the entity that owns the industrial or other commercial property such space is also subject to obsolescence as trends styles and technologies change thereby requiring significant infusions of capital to remain competitive and viable in the marketplace      table of contents   financing of real estate projects   although it is contemplated that the acquisition and development of assets will be financed by utilizing minimal or no debt if the company were to acquire debt to finance operations this aspect would increase ddgs exposure to loss principal and interest payments on indebtedness including mortgages having “balloon” payments will have to be made regardless of the sufficiency of cash flow from the assets mortgages requiring “balloon” payments may involve greater risks than mortgages where the principal amount is fully amortized over the term of the loan since the ability to repay the outstanding principal amount of the “balloon” loan may be dependent upon the ability to obtain adequate replacement financing which will in turn be dependent upon interest rates and lenders’ policies at the time of refinancing economic conditions in general and the value of the underlying assets in particular there is no assurance that replacement financing will be available to make “balloon” payments or that if available any replacement financing will be on favorable terms depending on the level of leverage and decline in value if mortgage payments are not made when due one or more of the assets may be lost and the investment therein rendered valueless as a result of foreclosure by the mortgagee   risks on disposition of certain investments   in connection with the disposition of a project the company may be required to make representations about the project typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business or real estate interest the company may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate incorrect or misleading   volatile market conditions for mortgages and mortgagerelated assets   the company’s results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgagerelated assets including commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs as well as the broader financial markets and the economy generally beginning in the summer of  significant adverse changes in financial market conditions resulted in a deleveraging of the entire global financial system and the forced sale of large quantities of mortgagerelated and other financial assets concerns over economic recession geopolitical issues unemployment the availability and cost of financing the mortgage market and a declining real estate market contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets as a result of these conditions many traditional mortgage investors suffered severe losses in their residential mortgage portfolios and several major market participants failed or have been impaired resulting in a significant contraction in market liquidity for mortgagerelated assets this illiquidity negatively affected both the terms and availability of financing for all mortgagerelated assets increased volatility and deterioration in the markets for mortgages and mortgagerelated assets as well as the broader financial markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of any cmbs holdings the company may own at the time if these conditions occur institutions from which the company seeks financing for the company’s investments may tighten their lending standards or become insolvent which could make it more difficult for the company to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all adverse developments in the broader residential mortgage market may adversely affect the value of the assets in which the company invests   since the summer of  the residential mortgage market in the united states experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions including defaults credit losses and liquidity concerns certain commercial banks investment banks and insurance companies have announced extensive losses from exposure to the residential mortgage market these losses have reduced financial industry capital leading to reduced liquidity for some institutions these factors have impacted investor perception of the risk associated with cmbs in which the company intends to invest as a result values for cmbs in which the company may invest may experience a certain amount of volatility further increased volatility and deterioration in the broader mortgagebacked securities markets may adversely affect the performance and market value of the companys investments   actions of the us government federal reserve and treasury to stabilize financial markets   in response to the financial issues affecting the banking system and the financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions the us government the federal reserve the treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken action to attempt to stabilize the financial markets it is not possible to predict how future us government actions will impact the financial markets including current significant levels of volatility or the companys current or future investments in addition the us government federal reserve treasury and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address causes of the financial crisis the company cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur and such actions could have a dramatic impact on the companys business results of operations and financial condition   congress has enacted sweeping financial legislation the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the “doddfrank act” signed into law by president obama on july   regarding among other areas the operation of financial institutions many provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented through regulatory rulemakings and similar processes over several years and many of these rules have not been issued in final form therefore the impact of the doddfrank act and of followon regulation on trading strategies and operations is impossible to predict and may be adverse practices and areas of operation subject to significant change based on the impact direct or indirect of the doddfrank act and followon regulation may change in manners that are unforeseeable with uncertain effects by way of example and not limitation direct and indirect changes from the doddfrank act and followon regulation may occur to a significant degree with regard to among other areas the trading and use of many derivative instruments including swaps and strengthening the oversight and supervision of securities and capital market activities by the us securities and exchange commission “sec” there can be no assurance that such legislation or regulation will not have a material adverse effect on the company in addition congress may address tax policy which also could have uncertain direct and indirect impact on trading and operations      table of contents    further the doddfrank act created the financial stability oversight council “fsoc” an interagency body charged with identifying and monitoring systemic risks to financial markets the fsoc has the authority to require that nonbank financial companies that are “predominantly engaged in financial activities” whose failure it determines would pose systemic risk be placed under the supervision of the federal reserve and subject to enhanced prudential standards the fsoc has the authority to recommend that the federal reserve adopt more stringent prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements for nonbank financial companies supervised by the federal reserve but the federal reserve is expected to establish the prudential standards applicable to such companies the fsoc also has the authority to make recommendations to the federal reserve on various other matters that may affect the company the fsoc may also recommend that other federal financial regulators impose more stringent regulation upon or ban altogether financial activities of any financial firm that poses what it determines are significant risks to the financial system   the implementation of the doddfrank act could also adversely affect the company by increasing transaction andor regulatory compliance costs in addition greater regulatory scrutiny and the implementation of enhanced and new regulatory requirements may increase the companys exposure to potential liabilities and in particular liabilities arising from violating any such enhanced andor new regulatory requirements increased regulatory oversight could also impose administrative burdens on the company including without limitation responding to investigations and implementing new policies and procedures the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation is not yet certain and the company d may be affected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable   general economic and market conditions   the company’s investments will be affected by general economic conditions and local market conditions economic conditions could affect interest rates the extent and timing of the company’s investment activities and the availability of investments economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s ability to carry out its business or cause it to incur losses   the company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the company’s stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability   if the shares commence trading the trading price of the companys common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the company’s common stock   little experience in being a public company   the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the company’s operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the company’s business is unlikely to thrive   the company is an earlystage company with limited developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group as a reporting company the company is already subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources   the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the companys business financial condition and results of operations   these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed      table of contents    the board of directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the company that may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders   the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal for instance the issuance of a series of preferred stock might impede a business combination by including class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a transaction or facilitate a business combination by including voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders in addition under certain circumstances the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the common stock although the company’s board of directors is required to make any determination to issue such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the stockholders of the company the board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then market price of such stock the board of directors does not intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock unless otherwise required by law or otherwise   potential need for additional capital even beyond that offered herein   the company does not presently have sufficient operating capital to implement its existing business model and is dependent upon receipt of proceeds from this offering or elsewhere to expand and develop its business as intended the company believes that the proceeds to the company from the sale of the shares assuming that all shares offered are sold will provide the company with sufficient capital to develop and market the company’s business until it can begin generating enough profits from operations to fund future expansion many factors may however affect the company’s cash needs including the company’s possible failure to generate sufficient revenues from operation if less than all shares are sold the company may not have sufficient capital to fund expansion until sufficient revenues are generated from operations or elsewhere and may be unable to find suitable financing on terms acceptable to the company this event would significantly increase the risk to those persons who invest in this offering   no assurance of investment return   the companys investment portfolio will consist primarily of investments in real estate development projects and operating results in a specified period will be difficult to predict there is no assurance that ddg will be able to generate returns for its investors even if one or more of the projects are successful there can be no guarantee that the shareholders will receive distributions from the company in an amount equal to their investment or at all the returns generated by investors will also be affected by the amount of capital successfully raised by the company   use of any invested funds are immediately available to the company   the offering is being conducted on a best efforts basis and the proceeds from the shares offered hereby will not be subject to escrow and will be made available to the company for its immediate use no assurance can be given as to what number of shares if any will be subscribed or what amount of proceeds if any will be raised and available to the company should the company receive an amount less than offered hereby no assurance can be given as to the companys ability to finance its intended business objectives   the offering price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined by the company and such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the shares   currently there is no public market for the companys common stock the offering price for the shares has been arbitrarily determined by the company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the shares   investors in the offering may experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares   purchasers of the shares may experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the initial offering price per share paid by investors and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the price paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the purchase price   there has been no prior public market for the companys common stock and the lack of such a market may make resale of the shares difficult   no prior public market has existed for the companys securities and the company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop subsequent to this offering the company’s common stock is not presently included for trading on any exchange and there can be no assurances that the company will ultimately be registered on any exchange no assurance can be given that the shares of the company will ever qualify for inclusion on any trading market      table of contents   restrictions on transferability   the shares offered herein are restricted securities and unless registered with the securities and exchange commission can only be sold in compliance with rule  which provides that such securities cannot be sold or transferred for one year the rule  transferability requirements continue after one year for officers directors and greater  percent shareholders who may thereafter sell such securities every three months in an amount equal to the greater of  of the company’s outstanding common stock or the weekly average trading volume over the preceding four weeks to satisfy the requirements of such exemptions from registration under the securities act and to conform to applicable state securities laws each investor must acquire his shares for investment purposes only and not with a view towards distribution   consequently certain conditions of the securities act may need to be satisfied prior to any sale transfer or other disposition of the shares some of these conditions may include but are not limited to a minimum holding period availability of certain reports including financial statements and limitations on the percentage of shares sold and the manner in which they are sold the company can prohibit any sale transfer or disposition unless it receives an opinion of counsel provided at the holder’s expense in a form satisfactory to the company stating that the proposed sale transfer or other disposition will not result in a violation of applicable federal or state securities laws and regulations no public market exists for the shares no market is expected to develop for the foreseeable future and no market may ever develop at all consequently owners of the shares may have to hold their investment indefinitely and may not be able to liquidate their investments or pledge them as collateral for a loan in the event of an emergency   purchase of the shares is a long term investment   an investment in the shares may be long term and illiquid as discussed above the offer and sale of the shares will not be registered under the securities act or any foreign or state securities laws by reason of exemptions from such registration which depends in part on the investment intent of the investors prospective investors will be required to represent in writing that they are purchasing the shares for their own account for longterm investment and not with a view towards resale or distribution accordingly purchasers of shares must be willing and able to bear the economic risk of their investment for an indefinite period of time it is likely that investors will not be able to liquidate their investment in the event of an emergency   no dividends   the company does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying such dividends at any time in the immediate future at present the company will follow a policy of retaining all of its earnings if any to finance development and expansion of its business   arbitration   by execution of the subscription agreement for purchase of the shares investors in this offering agree to submit to arbitration for all claims arising from their investment arbitration may not afford investors all the relief they might obtain outside arbitration arbitration narrows procedural and other steps available to claimants such as discovery broad choice of venue and scope of appellate review and is in general a more informal process than court action on the other hand arbitration is normally a less expensive process for a claimant than court action and normally results in a quicker final decision however investors may find that as a result of arbitration they are more restricted in the resolution of claims if any arising from this investment   limited liability of management   the company has provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws which limit the liability of its officers and directors and provide for indemnification by the company of its officers and directors to the full extent permitted by delaware corporate law such provisions may substantially limit a shareholders ability to hold officers and directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty   lack of firm underwriter may impact the sale of the shares   the shares are offered on a “best efforts” basis by the management and board of directors without compensation and on a “best efforts” basis through certain finra registered brokerdealers which enter into participating brokerdealer agreements with the company accordingly there is no assurance that the company or any finra brokerdealer will sell the minimum

transactions larger than m investor demand has risen and is projected to continue to rise and diversify for the net lease sector with an increased desirability for singleasset product types this projection is denoted by an increase in singleasset sales which have reached the highest of the cycle – up  percent year over  year across sectors it should be noted however that net lease portfolio transactions have been constrained throughout  following a peak year in  factor in overall net lease volume declines of  percent yearoveryear   institutions drive onethird of primary market acquisitions primary market competition drives developers and highnetworth individuals deeper into secondary markets assessing net lease cap rates the  jll research study has indicated that office

net lease cap rate at  and office net lease cap rate at    the  jll research study further notes that after increased financial market volatility in the first half of  the quality of assets closed and brought to market during the third quarter has increased evidenced by many assets having stronger lease quality with greater than ten years of remaining lease term for instance in the third quarter of   headquarters assets sold for a combined billion in aggregate value indicating that industrial acquisitions are demonstrating a strong connection between market liquidity and leasehold quality with risk appetites higher in the primary markets   the  jll research study further concluded that institutional equity fund and offshore capital have of late been sustaining the competitive primary market environment the basis of this conclusion stems from the following analysis of recent market trends that as cap rates continue to compress and deployment pressures increase for select buyer types the pricing environment in turn has depended on the transfer of buyers between primary and secondary markets real estate investment trusts reits have been noted to experience a continued difficulty buying accretive assets that fit their acquisition profiles as seen with a steady shift from primary to tertiary markets since  with this primary market acquisitions have shifted further to institutional investors and equity funds as private buyers struggle to compete institutional buyers have consistently increased participation in acquisition across primary markets since  – notably in the office

industry operators are expected to benefit from improvements in the lending conditions that changed during the five years to  over the fiveyear period operators with sufficient means purchased properties below market values as banks and competitors desperately tried to unload real estate assets to generate capital meanwhile tight lending conditions forced many operators to consolidate with

prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date   level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of
