daily wok cooking goes at his newest restaurants in arlington and rockville in the old days in china he says via business partner gen lee meat for the dish was seasoned and roasted whole for hours the

fact sheets provide useful information on various topics related to sheep view the list of fact sheets sheep byproducts the hidden resource when most people think of sheep products two items come to mind meat and wool  granted these two products account for the majority of the income for sheep producers however there are numerous possibilities to use all parts of the sheep  in using the carcass to the full extent everybody from the producer to the consumer benefits  the major benefits come from both economical and environmental aspects  by using all parts of the carcass it becomes more valuable to the processor and as a result the lamb becomes more valuable meaning that the producer benefits economically  most importantly the consumer saves money in two ways from the processor using the entire lamb  first the price of lamb meat is reduced because the processors income increases by using the entire carcass  second since sheep byproducts can be sold at a low price the products that they go into can also be sold at a lower cost  from an environmental standpoint in using the entire carcass less waste is accumulated  by producing less waste that needs to be disposed of everyone benefits from a cleaner environment   although byproducts provide a great opportunity for everyone in the sheep industry to profit few in the industry are actually reaping the benefits  it is only through educating those integrally involved in the industry that the full resources of this opportunity may come into fruition  the purpose of this web site is to explore and educate on the many byproduct of sheep   to begin with lets divide the parts of a sheep carcass that can be used for byproducts and describe how these products can be extracted �         from the intestines �         from the horns hooves  bone �         from manure �         from fats  fatty acids �         from wool �         from hide from the intestines in most cases after the intestines are eviscerated they would be disposed of  however they can be converted to many valuable products  once cleaned the intestines can be used as natural casings for foods such as sausages and frankfurters  this type of casing provides an economical and safe packing material for these popular foods  a high value byproduct of the intestines are instrument strings  though labor intensive this product can be sold at a high price  sheep intestines provide a critical product for the veterinary field  once processed the intestines are made into suture material  by using natural sutures from sheep veterinarians avoid complications such as immune responses that arise from synthetic sutures  also these sutures are less invasive because the body reabsorbs them over time   from horns hooves  bone the horns hooves and bones are rich sources of keratin and collagen among other things  these two proteins are important due to their binding ability and strength  the properties of these proteins allow the horns hooves and bones of sheep to be used for a wide variety of products  these products include bone charcoal for high grade steel shampoo and conditioner bone china collagen and bone for plastic surgery horn and bone handles bone meal bone jewelry adhesive tape gelatin capsules bone charcoal pencils marshmallows piano keys gelatin desserts ice cream yogart and jello film and shepard crooks   from manure one of the last places that one would look for a usable byproduct is sheep manure  however due to the ruminant digestive action of sheep many valuable minerals are found in the manure  the manure contains nitrogen phosphorous potassium carbonate and lower levels of various minerals  since manure contains these minerals it is a valuable part of such products as fertilizer and potash           from fats  fatty acids although ill regarded and of little per unit value fats and fatty acids can add to the value of the carcass  due to the high quantities available on the carcass once fats and fatty acids are further processed uses can be found for these otherwise worthless attributes of the carcass  sheep fat and fatty acids can be added to dog and chicken feeds with relatively little further processing  they provide an inexpensive source of energy to fill the needs of the diet  through further processing fats and fatty acids can be used as components in wax products  examples of these products are paraffin crayons candles and floor wax  also fats and fatty acids play an integral role in chemicals glycol is found in brake fluid and glycerol is the ingredient that makes asphalt stick together to top things off most people dont realize that products they use on themselves everyday such as makeup cosmetics tanning lotion shaving cream and hand cream contain sheep fat and fatty acids   from wool wool itself is a common product of the sheep industry and like all other sheep products there is waste material generated that can be converted into profitable items  these products include lanolin artists brushes insulation and rug pads  without wool byproducts there would be no baseball because the ball is stuffed with wool it is sewn with wool thread its rubber lining is made from stearic acid and the cork center contains processed blood       from hide as an alternative to expensive leather from beef hides sheep hides can be used as an economical alternative once removed and processed the hides can be used in the making of sporting goods such as baseballs footballs tennis balls and basketballs  also the leather from sheep hide can replace virtually all leather products made from the leather of beef hide such as footwear and drum heads       in conclusion hopefuly this site has shown the potential of sheep byproducts to benefit all those involved in the industry  from the producer to the consumer everyone can enjoy lower prices and a better environment through the use of the many byproducts described here  the knowledge of sheep byproducts is the key that opens the door to both profits and a better environment for all those in the sheep industry   references and resoures wwwsheepusaorg for shepards crooks wwwymccollcommidihtml for sheep

big stink by david wencer the peter r lamb and co glue factory after a fire on may   city of toronto archives fonds  item  “the offensive odours which are wafted into the necropolis from lamb’s glue factory are so powerful that they drive people out of the graveyard” so claimed an item that ran in the globe on june   typical of the increasing public complaints about the factory the factory in question was the peter r lamb and co glue and blacking manufactory which for  years stood at the eastern end of amelia street directly north of the toronto necropolis cemetery near the don river while it provided employment and various necessary industrial products to the city lamb’s glue factory was one of the city’s most fragrant and thus unpopular industries an article by e louise boyd in the york pioneer suggests that peter lamb tried other businesses in the united states before coming to toronto in  boyd writes that his earlier ventures included managing a shoe company which he left upon discovering that the factory employed slave labour a description of lamb’s business in the wc chewett  co city directory for  claims the factory first opened in  although other sources suggest it may have started a few years earlier sources also disagree about the factory’s earliest locations boyd writes that lamb first set up business at yonge and temperance whereas early toronto historian john ross robertson notes an s site of lamb’s factory on front street west of the don in  an anonymous writer contributed childhood memories of toronto to the globe and claimed that the lamb factory was initially located at church and carlton sketch of front street showing what is believed to be an earlier site of the lamb factory in the late s at “” robertson’s landmarks of toronto a collection of historical sketches of the old town of york from  until  and of toronto from  to  j ross robertson  toronto in  peter lamb established a new factory at amelia and sumach where it would remain until  lamb’s factory was the first major industrial site in the immediate vicinity which was at this time a sparsely populated area on the fringes of toronto the move to this location was in line with a thengrowing movement to establish heavier industries along the lower portion of the don river spurred by cheap available land and convenient shipping access the location also put lamb in close proximity to industries farther south along the don many of which supplied him with necessary materials or which used lamb’s glue or other products in reclaiming the don jennifer bonnell asserts that the industrial growth along the lower don at this time created “constellations of mutually supportive operations soapworks in the lower valley for example took advantage of local supplies of tallow from nearby animal processing plants while tanneries produced leather belts used for power transmission in early factories and mills” in the days before synthetic adhesives most glues were made by subjecting hides bone hooves fish and other animal parts to high heat these animal parts were usually supplied to glue manufacturers by tanners meatpackers and other industries whose processes produced small scraps that would otherwise go to waste in an  globe advertisement for peter r lamb and co the company directly appealed to other toronto industries for materials using the line “tanners save your glue pieces cash paid for tanners’ size pieces cattle tails and horns” right advertisement for peter r lamb and co the globe august   getting highgrade waste products could prove challenging for glue manufacturers in a  publication on glue manufacturing paul i smith lamented that “most tanners simply ‘dump’ their hide and skin waste in a convenient spot and leave it until the gluemaker sends his compliments” smith observed that such practices reduce the quality of the glue that could be obtained and advocates turning over the scrap heaps at least once a day to keep them fresh and thus maintain their quality “by keeping his hide and skin offal in sweet condition the tanner not only ensures a better market but also eliminates some of the bad smells with which a tanyard is usually associated as well as facilitating the entire process of glue production” in addition to glue the lamb factory also produced a variety of other industrial products derived from animal sources advertisements indicate the company also produced “neat’s foot oil” sic a substance derived from cattle bones and often used in the preservation of leather the factory was also well known for its blacking polish derived from animal charcoal and its bonebased fertilizer which was often referred to as “manure” in company promotional material lamb also produced gelatine a review of lamb products in the  globe observes that “perhaps some of our lady readers do not know that the delicate jelly which they receive from the confectioner for evening parties is made of the same material as the dark sticky glue which they may have chanced to see in a carpenter’s pot” the glue factory seen at right on the  goad fire insurance map despite producing an array of products glue appears to have been the product with which peter r lamb and co was mostly publicly associated advertisements reveal that the company had a variety of types on offer likely derived from different sources and intended for various purposes one  advertisement boasts that lamb made glue “adapted to the use of pianoforte carriage cabinet and paper hanging manufacturers rock oil refiners printers bookbinders etc” lamb’s glue was not marketed for home use but for other industrial purposes and was likely purchased by other toronto companies although advertisements suggest that some of the final products were shipped to other parts of the british empire early descriptions of lamb’s factory and its products in the toronto newspapers are positive a february  globe article reports recent improvements and expansion on the site and indicates that lamb has received several patents for manufacturing techniques and design in reviewing the company’s products the same article notes that “in the manufacture of glue the greatest difficulty has been to get tanners to save in good state their cuttings or pieces but gradually they are seeing the importance of properly preserving them as a much better rate is realized therefore mr lamb’s glue is well known to the trade on account of its good quality” after the factory was destroyed by a fire a few months later a globe editorial rejoiced at the news that it would be rebuilt writing “mr lamb has done a great good in making use of the refuse of our kitchens—converting it into a most valuable manure and also in supplying two very necessary articles of domestic economy for which we were before obliged to send abroad we are glad to hear that he is soon to be at work again” peter lamb died in  and control of the glue factory passed to his son daniel then only  years old while lamb products particularly the fertilizers continued to receive positive reviews the factory soon came under close scrutiny in the toronto press left daniel lamb the globe december   turning animal parts into glue over high heat produces an intensely strong smell in her  thesis imagined futures and unintended consequences jennifer bonnell writes that “the stench of dead animals and boiling flesh would have been palpable to residents as the area south and west of the factory became increasingly built up in the s and ’s” in addition to the nearby necropolis cemetery and toronto general hospital which was then located near gerrard and sumach residential development had populated the area some of it housing designed specifically for local factory workers a notice in the globe on july   described the smell coming as a “nuisance” adding that “every window in toronto general hospital had to be closed by reason of it monday night” responding to this allusion to the lamb factory at mccord one of the trustees of the necropolis cemetery wrote to the globe decrying the stench from the glue factory “it is at times intolerable” mccord wrote “and drives away those who desire to visit the remains of the dead…glue factories are an insufferable nuisance and should never be permitted within the limits of any city or town” the city of toronto was also in the process of establishing what would become riverdale park which mccord claimed “will be comparatively useless if this factory is permitted to remain” the globe sympathized with mccord “the line has been passed where what in former years was practically inoffensive owing to a small population in the neighbourhood becomes a serious grievance to a portion of the city now well populated” the company responded to the complaints with letters in several of the toronto dailies noting that they had taken action to reduce odours after previous complaints and claiming that this recent incident was an isolated one brought on by being shut down over a long weekend lamb also mentioned the jobs it supplied to the area and claimed that despite concerns about the pollution “there has been not one case of sickness attributed to our works and in all the epidemics of cholera smallpox typhoid fever etc there has never been in a case in our immediate neighbourhood” advertisement for peter r lamb from hutchinson’s toronto directory  lamb’s letters prompted several rebuttals from the public one letter to the globe took issue with the claim that the recent incident was an isolated one claiming “not only is it necessary for the hospital to close its windows but also evening after evening this spring and summer and for many springs and summers past every house in the locality…has been almost hermetically sealed to prevent the disgusting odour from permeating them through and through” another intense round of letters deploring the factory came in the summer of  again daniel lamb wrote to the newspapers to defend the glue factory this time suggesting that his factory was being unfairly blamed for smells emanating from other sources in response a letter in the telegram noted that “we know the peculiar sickening odour of his factory too well to mistake any smell arising from a scavenger dump for it” a globe editorial concluded that “it appears quite evident that there never was a more favourable time in which to take action for the removal of the nuisance” and suggested that the complainants “appoint a committee to confer with messrs lamb as to the best means of procuring the removal” some meetings did indeed take place but it appears that no action was taken the problem was effectively solved next spring on may   a police patrolman noticed flames coming from the factory’s main fivestorey building a small crowd gathered to watch the fire but scattered for safety when it learned that a magazine containing  pounds of gunpowder used by local industries was a mere  yards from the rear of the factory firefighters were able to keep the flames from reaching the magazine but were otherwise hampered in their efforts as only one hydrant existed in the immediate area and the majority of the works were lost the globe noted that the heat from the fire was “so great at times that three of the firemen had their rubber coats melted on their backs” also of note the telegram reported that “the horses about the factory were turned loose but a pet bear on the premise had to be dragged out by a rope to a place of safety” fire damage following the fire on may   city of toronto archives fonds  item  despite some early claims by lamb that he would rebuild his glue works the city resumed negotiations for the purchase of the site although the land was not acquired until several years later the matter appears to have been effectively settled by the end of the  when the globe noted that alderman and future mayor rj fleming had been instrumental “in having the lamb glue factory nuisance abolished” the factory was not rebuilt and a  toronto star article indicates that bricks from the old glue factory building were used in the construction of houses on hillcrest park for daniel lamb the fire proved somewhat convenient public pressure to remove the factory likely would have escalated as efforts were already underway to tackle pollution and health concerns in the area by straightening the lower section of the don river only in his s lamb retired from the glue business having briefly served as an alderman a few years earlier he soon returned to city politics serving again as an alderman from  to  he is best known today however for helping to establish and advocating for the riverdale zoo the immediate predecessor of the toronto zoo when daniel lamb died
