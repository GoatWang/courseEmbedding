of the us air travel market several consumer organizations as well as orbitzs primary competitors at the time expedia sabre travelocity galileo spent significant amounts of money lobbying the united states department of transportation to block the project from the outset and some  state attorneys general also voiced concerns due to the complaints of local competitors when the dot permitted the company to move ahead in april  the competitive lobbying effort was switched to the antitrust division of the united states department of justice and the us house committee on energy and commercecitation needed among the concerns raised were these above all the socalled most favored nation provision by which the airlines agreed not to cut deals with competing sites under more favorable terms than with orbitz the airlines agreement to release certain discount fares only to orbitz or other entities at orbitz low distribution cost at the expense of its online and offline competitors that computer reservation system fee discounts extended to partner airlines would undermine competitors and damage the fledgling online travel industry that the airlines would coordinate efforts secretly to reduce discounts orbitz was breaking out the service fee from the ticket price not making the total price clear in july  two years after the orbitz launch the department of justice ruled that orbitz was not a cartel and did not pose a threat to competition orbitzs rapid growth had not impeded its online competitors businesses which had continued to grow apace and no evidence was found of price fixing additionally changes in the marketplace had eroded both the advantages of the most favored nation clause and the webfares that orbitz had due to its low supplier cost the efforts

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf
