march   at  pm updated march   at  pm comments hancock holding co said wednesday that once its acquisition of whitney holding corp is complete joseph s exnicios will preside over the banks operations in louisiana and texas exnicios has served as whitney banks chief risk officer since  a difficult position given that the new orleans bank has struggled in recent years with problem loans that it made in florida but hancock president and ceo carl chaney said wednesday that some of the best bankers in the industry are individuals who have come up through risk departments and helped financial institutions navigate challenging environments once hancocks takeover of whitney is complete banking sites in alabama mississippi and florida will operate under the hancock bank name while locations in louisiana and texas will operate under the whitney bank name exnicios who has a law degree from loyola university and a bachelors degree in business administration from louisiana state university will be president of whitney bank he has been employed by whitney since  hancock also announced wednesday that suzanne c thomas will continue as chief credit officer of whitney bank after the merger thomas has been with whitney since  john hope whitneys current ceo will retire once the merger is complete john turner jr who currently serves as president of whitney bank will work closely with chaney and and john m hairston who serves as dual chief executive officer for hancock on the transition even after the merger is complete we need his background and his steady hand in the transition hairston said of turner hairston also said whitneys current leadership in commercial and consumer lending will remain intact with those individuals overseeing the combined banks lending operations in louisiana whitney bank will be the larger of the two hancock banking companies in terms of total assets employees and other measures in fact of the  billion in assets the combined company will have roughly  billion will be in louisiana and controlled by whitney bank according to hairston the whitney bank operations will be headquartered in new orleans headquarters for hancock bank and for hancock holding will be in gulfport miss the merger which was announced dec  is subject to the approval of regulators and shareholders dates for the shareholders of hancock and whitney to meet and vote have not yet been set chaney said once the deal is complete current customers of whitney may notice expanded products as well as geographic locations chaney said while whitney bank has maintained a strong commercial banking focus hancock has traditionally focused on meeting the banking needs of consumers chaney said the two banks also share similar cultures and business philosophies we are very complementary you end up with a very powerful franchise when the two banks are combined chaney said theres a whole lot more good that will come for clients rather than bad hairston said chaney said that about two weeks after the merger was announced he checked in with a hancockoperated call center to see what questions operators were getting from customers about the deal the number one question chaney said came from hancock customers wondering if the deal would allow them to obtain checks and debit cards bearing the new orleans saints logo last year whitney announced a partnership with the saints and rolled out a popular program that offers checks and debit cards bearing the nfl teams logo chaney also said whitney bank once it becomes a part of hancock holding will continue to be involved as a sponsor in a range of community events we fully intend to continue being a major corporate sponsor he said once the merger is complete the combined company will have  branches  atms and  employees in louisiana mississippi alabama florida and texas it will be the nd largest bank holding company headquartered in the united states according to hancock kimberly quillen can be reached
