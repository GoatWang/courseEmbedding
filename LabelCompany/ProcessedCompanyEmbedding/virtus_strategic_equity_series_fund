notes to schedules of investments january   unaudited note significant accounting policies the following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the phoenix strategic equity series fund in the preparation of the schedules of investments the preparation of the schedules of investments in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the schedules of investments actual results could differ from those estimates a security valuation equity securities are valued at the official closing price typically last sale on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded or if no closing price is available at the last bid price debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations provided by a pricing service which utilizes information with respect to recent sales market transactions in comparable securities quotations from dealers and various relationships between securities in determining value as required some securities and assets may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the trustees certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily available market prices for example significant events such as movement in the us securities market or other regional and local developments may occur between the time that foreign markets close where the security is principally traded and the time that the fund calculates its net asset value generally the close of the nyse that may impact the value of securities traded in these foreign markets in these cases information from an external vendor may be utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to reflect their fair value because the frequency of significant events is not predictable fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a frequent basis shortterm investments having a remaining maturity of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market in september  statement of financial accounting standards no  fair value measurements sfas  was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   sfas  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas  will have on the funds financial statement disclosures b security transactions and related income security transactions are recorded on the trade date dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date or in the case of certain foreign securities as soon as the fund is notified interest income is recorded on the accrual basis each fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective interest method realized gains and losses are determined on the identified cost basis

end of the reporting period cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at the trade date d foreign security country determination a combination of the following criteria is used to assign the countries of risk listed in the schedules of investments country of incorporation actual building address primary exchange on which the security is traded and country in which the greatest percentage of company revenue is generated note asset concentrations in countries with limited or developing markets investments may present greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments may be volatile the consequences of political social or economic changes in these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these investments and the income they generate as well as a funds ability to repatriate such amounts each fund may invest a high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in their pursuit of a greater investment return fluctuations in these sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on a fund positive or negative than if a fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors at january

phoenix equity planning corporation  compliance standards for the sale of the phoenix funds under their alternative purchase arrangements as national distributor or principal underwriter of the phoenix funds which offer their shares on both a frontend and deferred sales charge basis phoenix equity planning corporation pepco has established the following compliance standards which set forth the basis upon which shares of the phoenix funds may be sold these standards are designed for those brokerdealers dealers that distribute shares of the phoenix funds and for each dealers financial advisorsregistered representatives as shares of the phoenix funds are offered with two different sales arrangements for sales and distribution fees it is important for an investor not only to choose a mutual fund that best suits his investment objectives but also to choose the sales financing method which best suits his particular situation to assist investors in these decisions and to ensure proper supervision of mutual fund purchase recommendations we are instituting the following compliance standards to which dealers must adhere when selling shares of the phoenix funds  any purchase of a phoenix fund for less than  may be either of shares subject to a frontend load class a shares or subject to deferred sales charge class b shares  any purchase of a phoenix fund by an unallocated qualified employer sponsored plan for less than  may be either of shares subject to a frontend load class a shares or subject to deferred sales charge class b shares class b shares sold to allocated qualified employer sponsored plans will be limited to a maximum total value of  per participant  any purchase of a phoenix fund for  or more except as noted above or which qualifies under the terms of the prospectus for net asset value purchase of class a shares should be for class a shares general guidelines these are instances where one financing method may be more advantageous to an investor than the other class a shares are subject to a lower distribution fee and accordingly pay correspondingly higher dividends per share however because initial sales charges are deducted at the time of purchase such investors would not have all of their funds invested initially and therefore would initially own fewer shares investors not qualifying for reduced initial sales charges who expect to maintain their investment for an extended period of time might consider purchasing class a shares because the accumulated continuing distribution charges on class b shares may exceed the initial sales charge on class a shares during the life of the investment again however such investors must weigh this consideration against the fact that because of such initial sales charge not all of their funds will be invested initially however other investors might determine that it would be more advantageous to purchase class b shares to have all of their funds invested initially although remaining subject to higher continuing distribution charges and for a fiveyear period being subject to a contingent deferred sales charge three years for asset reserve a national association of securities dealers rule specifically prohibits breakpoint sales of frontend load shares a breakpoint sale is a sale to the client of an amount of frontend load class a shares just below the amount which would be subject to the next breakpoint on the funds sales charge schedule because the deferred sales charge on class b shares is reduced by  for each year the shares are held a redemption of class b shares just before an anniversary date is in some ways analogous to a breakpoint sale a client might wish to redeem just before an anniversary date for tax or other reasons and a client who chose to wait would continue to be at market risk nevertheless investment executives should inform clients intending to redeem class b shares near an anniversary date that if the redemption were delayed the deferred sales charge would be reduced responsibilities of branch office manager or other appropriate reviewing officer a dealers branch manager or other appropriate reviewing officer the reviewing officer must ensure that the financial advisorregistered representative has advised the client of the available financing methods offered by the phoenix funds and the impact of choosing one method over another in certain instances it may be appropriate for the reviewing officer to discuss the purchase directly with the client the reviewing officer should review purchases for class a or class b shares given the relevant facts and circumstances including but not limited to a the specific purchase order dollar amount b the length of time the investor expects to hold his shares and c any other relevant circumstances such as the availability of purchase under letters of intent or pursuant to rights of accumulation and distribution requirements the foregoing guidelines as well as the examples cited above should assist the reviewing officer in reviewing and supervising purchase recommendations and orders effectiveness these compliance guidelines are effective immediately with respect to any order for shares of those phoenix funds which offer their shares pursuant to the alternative purchase arrangement questions relating to these compliance guidelines should be directed by the dealer to its national mutual fund sales and market group or its legal department or compliance director pepco will advice dealers in writing of any future changes in these guidelines pxpb  rdates referenced
