looking to the decade ahead from ai to vr to drones facebook ceo mark zuckerberg by harry mccrackenlong read“mark is fixing stuff”advertisementi’m killing time in the frank gehry–designed building  whose signature feature is its soaring  square feet of open space the latest addition to facebook’s campus in menlo park california a pr handler is explaining why ceo mark zuckerberg is running slightly behind schedule for our chat i express surprise mark still fixes stuff“to say he’s actively involved” she confides “is an understatement he notices things that are broken before anybody”as recently as  the year zuckerberg set a personal goal to code every day that might have meant he had detected something glitchy on facebook’s site and was reprogramming it himself when he emerges a few minutes later unspecified stuff presumably fixed we sit down on adjacent couches in a fishbowl conference room near his desk in building  and zuckerberg makes it clear that those days are gone “if we’re trying to build a worldclass news feed and a worldclass messaging product and a worldclass search product and a worldclass ad system and invent virtual reality and build drones i can’t write every line of code” he tells me “i can’t write any lines of code”the facebook of today—and tomorrow—is far more expansive than it was just a few years ago it’s easy to forget that when the company filed to go public on february   it was just a single website and an app that the experts weren’t sure could ever be profitable now “a billion and a half people use the main core facebook service and that’s growing but  million people use whatsapp and that’s an important part of the whole ecosystem now” zuckerberg says “four hundred million people use instagram  million people use messen­ger and  million people use groups increasingly we’re just going to go more and more in this direction”to further grow these services and any others that facebook develops or acquires zuckerberg is betting his company’s future on three major technology initiatives one is developing advanced artificial intelligence that can help facebook understand what matters to users the second is virtual reality in the form of oculus vr the groundbreaking company that facebook acquired in march  for  billion which zuckerberg believes will be the next major technology we use to interact with each other and the third is bringing the internet including facebook of course to the  billion–plus humans who aren’t yet connected even if it requires flying a drone over a village and beaming data down via laser given the robust health of facebook’s business zuckerberg is comfortable lavishing attention and resources on these visions facebook gave fast company wideranging access to zuckerberg his senior leadership team and others to delve into the company’s audacious plans to shape the next decade how zuck uses facebook mark zuckerberg has been using his own creation longer than anyone today his posts give insight into his interests and activities—and no matter the subject facebook’s mission of making the world more open and connected always seems to be top of mind he’s statesmanlike  likes if you see a photo of zuckerberg in a suit and tie the odds are high that he’s meeting with an international dignitary in september he hosted indian prime minister narendra modi for a townhall forum on facebook’s campus modi endorsed the power of social media to keep government accountable he’s human  likes on july  zuckerberg posted that his wife priscilla chan was expecting a baby girl after three miscarriages “you feel so hopeful when you learn you’re going to have a child you start imagining who they’ll become and dreaming of hopes for their future you start making plans and then they’re gone” click to expand he takes stances  likes when the us supreme court legalized samesex marriage zuckerberg posted a graphic showing the growth in facebook lgbt groups since  “our country was founded on the promise that all people are created equal and today we took another step toward achieving that promise” he celebrates success  likes “our community reached a nice milestone today” zuckerberg wrote in february more than  million small businesses were buying ads on facebook—which he said was good for those companies their customers and the economy left unstated it’s also very good for facebook he’s playful  likes in april zuckerberg donned sunglasses to pose with action star vin diesel who dropped by facebook to talk about what it’s like to have  million followers he was stoked—“i’m looking forward to seeing fast  furious  tonight”—and noted that diesel writes all his own facebook posts in the tech industry there’s nothing weird about setting goals so lofty that they sound unachievable google ceo larry page for instance is so invested in the virtue of gambling on disparate wildly ambitious projects—from selfdriving cars to smart contact lenses—that he restructured his company around the concept in august making google’s core businesses a division of a new idea factory called alphabet zuckerberg by contrast isn’t interested in doing everything—just the things he views as deeply related to his company’s central vision and crucial to it “there are different ways to do innovation” he says drawing a stark contrast without ever mentioning page google or alphabet “you can plant a lot of seeds not be committed to any particular one of them but just see what grows and this really isn’t how we’ve approached this we go missionfirst then focus on the pieces we need and go deep on them and be committed to them” facebook’s mission is “to give everyone in the world the power to share and make the world more open and connected” as zuckerberg says explaining that he is now spending a third of his time overseeing these future initiatives “these things can’t fail we need to get them to work in order to achieve the mission”advertisementwhen facebook was morphing from ivy league college project to silicon valley startup zuckerberg had not only “never run a company—he’d never been in a company” marvels marc andreessen the browser pioneer venture capitalist facebook board member and longtime zuckerberg confidant “he’s learned everything he knows about business in the last  years and now he’s one of the best ceos in the world”whether because zuckerberg  started so young or because he retains his youthful demeanor and graytshirt work uniform he has been underestimated for almost as long as his company has existed facebook wouldn’t work outside harvard it wouldn’t work outside elite colleges it wouldn’t work among the general populace it couldn’t topple myspace it couldn’t make enough money to justify its valuation it couldn’t hold on to teenagers once their parents signed up it wouldn’t matter as much on smartphones as it had on pcs it couldn’t make enough money on mobile to satisfy wall streetzuckerberg and his team have overcome every doubt nine out of ten of the  billion people a month who use facebook access it on a mobile device at least part of the time and more than threequarters of its  billion in advertising revenue in the third quarter of  came from mobile users the company runs four of the six largest social platforms in the world all but google’s youtube and tencent’s wechat and is wildly profitable three years ago when the company revealed that  billion people logged in to the service in one month the news was astounding last august  billion people used facebook on a single monday and it felt inevitablewhen i ask people close to zuckerberg how exactly he has pulled off these achievements i don’t hear a lot of anecdotes about him swooping in and personally making geniuslevel decisions that suddenly changed everything instead they praise his inquisitiveness persistence ability to deploy resources and devotion to improving facebook and himself he has a knack for carving up grand plans into small doable victories “most of our conversation was about longterm strategy and then we’d backtrack from there to what we should do over the next month” says bret taylor who worked as facebook’s cto from  to  and who was at the company when it corrected course after a famously bumpy first attempt at putting the service on smartphones “it’s one of the main reasons why facebook is where it is today”zuckerberg “is a total inspiration in how much he cares about his work and in how hard he works” says chris cox who dropped out of a stanford graduate program in  to join the company as a software engineer and is now chief product officer—and is so integral to its culture that he still speaks with every new employee as part of his or her orientation “for all of us who work with him it’s like man he is so good at improving”sue desmondhellmann is a facebook board member and ceo of the bill  melinda gates foundation which puts her in close proximity to two prodigies who quit harvard to seek fortunes out west both zuckerberg and bill gates she says “have this sense of relentlessness ‘why can’t that happen why can’t we accomplish this’ it can be fun to be around that it can also be like ‘oh my god’ ”advertisementwhen i meet with coo sheryl sandberg she shares a personal story of a family gathering involving the making of s’mores it captures several of zuckerberg’s preternatural gifts “mark said ‘i’m going to make a marshmallow’ ” she tells me in her conference room which is adorned with a framed drawing of her as spiderwoman “i looked at my friend and said ‘he’s going to make the perfect marshmallow’ because he’s going to be the one out of all of us who is going to have the patience in order to make the right marshmallow you can’t do it right in the fire because then it gets burnt you can’t walk away you actually have to sit there for five to  minutes with the marshmallow above the flame but not too close so that it gets completely heated but doesn’t burn and the only person who’s actually willing to do that is mark because he is that focused and that determined i’ve never met anyone with more perseverance than mark zuckerberg”in hindsight there were two particular moments that have put facebook in the enviable position of being able to pursue its most audacious dreams the first was a recruiting spree back in – when the company concluded that it needed more players with serious silicon valley experience a significant percentage of the current leadership joined during this time including sandberg who came from google to be the principal architect of the business from mozilla the firefox browser purveyor zuckerberg hired mike schroepfer—known universally as schrep—who ultimately replaced taylor as cto“the amount of trust and bandwidth that you build up working with someone for five seven  years it’s just awesome” says zuckerberg “i care about openness and connectedness in a global sense sandberg has the emotional warmth and ability to connect with people that allows us to live that mission inside the company she’s even better than people think she is” as for schrep “he’s just extraordinary at the patience and composure you need for managing longterm projects” “one of our goals” zuckerberg says “is to get better than human level at all of the primary senses”zuckerberg unlike many of his rivals has been able to keep his leadership team stable their cohesiveness led to the second key moment the instagram acquisition and its subsequent successadvertisementwhen facebook announced that it was buying the photosharing juggernaut in april  less than six weeks before its ipo a flurry of articles followed with titles such as “five ways facebook will ruin in­stagram” instead the deal became a model for how businesses in facebook’s portfolio get managed zuckerberg left cofounders kevin systrom and mike krieger in charge encouraged them to preserve their own culture and gave them access to tools—from facebook’s recruiting team to its spamfighting technologies—that helped them get where they were planning to go anyway only faster advertisement “schrep and i work daytoday operationally on how we build our team where we hire from organizational stuff” says systrom instagram’s lanky bearded ceo “mark and i work most closely on product and sheryl and i work most closely on advertising and strategic issues around policy imagine getting to have mark sheryl and schrep on your board many companies in the valley would kill to have that and we get it by default which is pretty sweet” instagram’s user base tripled in the  months after the acquisition announcement to  million monthly users then doubled in the next  months it now boasts  million users naomi gleit vp product social good “we are taking a datadriven productdriven approach to doing good in the world you’re interested in certain causes and you’re also interested in the causes that your friends are interested in so we’re trying to take a social angle” the lessons facebook learned from the deal may have been as valuable as instagram’s revenue potential it began pursuing major acquisitions more aggressively—it acquired whatsapp and oculus in early —and then found itself looking at its own services with fresh eyes zuckerberg hired paypal president david marcus to run its chat product messenger and decided to remove it from facebook’s smartphone version forcing users to download a standalone app “we were all incredibly uncomfortable with that” says a former facebook employee who was present when zuckerberg explained his rationale “but he had thought it through carefully the core use cases and the competitive situation” a little over a year later messenger’s active user base more than tripledsplitting messenger off from facebook let marcus begin to build his own business model one akin to china’s messaging behemoth wechat messenger has its own app store with partners such as espn offering animated gifs and a feature that allows companies including ecommerce retailers everlane and zulily to conduct customer service—from delivery tracking to returns—within messenger “we’re not in a rush” says marcus “but over time we can build a really good business out of these interactions”three thousand miles away from facebook’s menlo park headquar­ters in an office building in new york’s noho neighborhood that was once a wanamaker department store a researcher named rob fergus is showing me software designed to identify objects in a video stream computers have long struggled to learn what’s happening in video which contains so much more data than text or a still photo he points a webcam that’s attached to a laptop running his program at a remote control the software which is so computationally intensive that it causes the cooling fans inside his laptop to kick in at a full earpiercing blast thinks the remote is a turtle he focuses the camera on a computer mouse once again it thinks it’s spotted a turtle only occasionally does it correctly identify an item up and to the right facebook’s growth machine is what gives the company its currency to pursue ai vr and connectivity facebook monthly active userspopulation us and

demonstration isn’t to prove that facebook is ready to roll out this ai feature just that they’re working on itadvertisementif you’ve ever felt like your facebook news feed is filled with people you don’t care about sharing thoughts you didn’t particularly want to hear you’ll appreciate why facebook is pushing to further the art of artificial intelligence in its current form the social network is still far better at collecting vast amounts of data than understanding what that data means advanced ai could help emphasize the stuff that’s truly relevant to you keeping you on the service longer and boosting your attractiveness as a subject for targeted advertising “facebook is working to be at the center of the world of ai because it will affect instagram whatsapp and messenger” says systrom “it’s broadly applicable to all social products”facebook has dabbled in ai for years in  for example it introduced facialrecognition technology to identify people in photos in late  though zuckerberg came to believe that ai—which he calls “one of the hardest engineering challenges of our time”—was central to the company’s future and decided to establish a lab devoted to it he began courting yann lecun a new york university faculty member and worldclass expert in deep learning to run it unlike the archetypal young turk facebook employee the yearold parisborn lecun is an éminence grise of his craft with decades of experience studying machine vision pattern recognition and other technologies with the potential to make the social network smarterlecun however was disinclined to leave academia or new york when zuckerberg thinks facebook needs something though he refuses to treat obstacles as obstacles he offered to let lecun set up facebook ai research’s headquarters in manhattan and retain his professorship on the side lecun came aboard problem solvedbecause zuckerberg would not be able to interact with lecun in person on a daily basis he had the ai researchers who did work at facebook’s main campus sit near him so he could learn from them “when we moved to the new building we ended up being separated from zuck by about  yards” lecun chuckles “he said ‘no this is too far move closer’ ” and so they did this is a signature move that zuckerberg uses to absorb new material when the team prepared facebook’s timeline feature in  he placed key design talent near his desk and he seated systrom near him after the instagram acquisitionthe mandate for the person ai team is also vintage zuckerberg aim ridiculously high and focus on where you want to go over the long term “one of our goals for the next five to  years” zuckerberg tells me “is to basically get better than human level at all of the primary human senses vision hearing language general cognition taste and smell we’re not that worried about” he deadpans “for now”in part the ai effort is an attempt to prepare facebook for an era in which devices from wristwatches to cars will be connected and the density of incoming information which the service will have to deal with will grow exponentially “there’s just going to be a lot more data generated about what’s happening in the world and the conventional models and systems that we have today won’t scale” says jay parikh the company’s vp of engineering “if there’s x or x or x more things happening around you in the world then you’re going to need these really really intelligent systems like what yann and his team are building”advertisementbut fergus and his fellow researchers have the freedom to start small rather than think immediately of the massive data problems posed by services with several hundred million users or more antoine bordes who relocated from a french university to join the new york team though there’s now a paris branch because the city is also a hotbed of ai talent is teaching a computer concepts such as “john is in the playground” and “john picked up the football” in order to help it learn to answer queries such as “where is the football” everything draws on a vocabulary of just  words a purposefully dinky number chosen so that researchers can tell exactly what’s going on “this is not big data” says bordes who is wearing a tshirt depicting a robot boxing a dinosaur “this is supersmall data”“i joke that the lab has paid for itself over the next five years with work they’ve already done” says schroepfer advertisement lecun has given facebook a lab with a strong universitylike feel rather than having to make sure their work lines up with facebook’s product plans researchers—many of them fellow academics—can pursue their passions while a separate group applied machine learning is responsible for figuring out how to turn the lab’s breakthroughs into features “the senior research scientists you don’t tell them what to work on” lecun says “they tell you what’s interesting”technologies incubated by lecun and his team are already popping up in facebook products such as moments a new app that scours your phone’s camera roll for snapshots of friends then lets you share those photos with those people “most researchers do care about their stuff having practical relevance” says fergus who is technically still on leave from nyu where he worked alongside lecun “in academia a great outcome is you publish a paper that people seem to like at a conference”lecun’s work is directly affecting facebook’s bottom line in the form of better spamprevention tools and software to verify that ads are up to company standards a task that was once a laborintensive manual process “i joke that the lab has paid for itself over the next five years with work they’ve already done” says schroepferadvertisementpalmer luckey and i are flapping our arms in adjoining isolationboothlike rooms in oculus’s quarters in building  on facebook’s campus in the virtualreality world we’re sharing though luckey the endearing yearold wunderkind who founded oculus vr in his parents’ garage in  has transmogrified himself into a hovering cartoony head and hands and we’re playing antigravity pingpong next we set off fireworks together and he shoots me with a zap gun which instantly shrinks me to the size of a gnat as he towers above mea few days later when i meet with zuckerberg for our first conversation he’s eager to talk about oculus pingpong even before i begin asking him questions as he delineates the pleasures that useradjustable physics bring to table tennis his expression takes on some of the same goofy glee i’d experienced zuckerberg a gamer himself is a devotee of civilization a venerable game series that oculus ceo brendan iribe worked on in a previous life the goal of the original  version of civ—“build an empire to stand the test of time”—neatly encapsulates its appeal to the zuckerbergian brain mike schroepfer cto “i have one hand in the daytoday and one hand in the future it’s a little bit crazymaking at times but it’s important that our core business continues to do well because that is what allows us to aggressively invest in these longerterm things” anyone who’s had his or her mind blown by a few minutes of oculus time in a d degree world can appreciate why zuckerberg is grinning but if oculus was only about games it wouldn’t be an obvious fit for his missionfirst vision of facebook’s future his interest in vr dates back to his experience with of all things phones when the modern smartphone was being born—apple’s iphone debuted in  and google’s android in —facebook was a redhot startup but there was no way it could have written its own mobile platform from scratch let alone persuaded the rest of the industry to adopt it by  when it had a bit more clout facebook created home which slathered a facebookbased veneer on top of android the notable flop reinforced the limitations of building on someone else’s operating system “one of my big regrets” zuckerberg says wistfully “is that facebook hasn’t had a major chance to shape the mobile operating system ecosystem” the company has done okay on smartphones multiple studies show that facebook captures more of users’ mobile time than any other serviceoculus then represents two big bets in one that vr will be the next major computing platform supplanting phones the same way that handheld devices usurped desktops—and that human nature won’t change “if you look at how people spend time on all computing platforms whether it’s phones or desktops before that about  is spent on some kind of communications and media” zuckerberg says “over the long term when oculus becomes a more mature platform i would bet that it’s going to be that same  of the time spent doing social interactions and things like that and that’s what we know that’s what we can do” already oculus helped out with facebook’s new degree video feature that debuted last septemberbefore zuckerberg’s vision can be realized oculus needs to start shipping its rift headsets the facebook acquisition didn’t change the company’s nearterm goal which is to offer a version of rift aimed at hardcore gamers the closest iribe has gotten to disclosing how much the headset will cost is saying that the allin investment including a pc will be about  that includes an xbox one gamepad provided through a surprise deal with microsoft the oculus touch hand controllers which are as much of a revelation as the headset and necessary for tasks such as wielding a pingpong paddle will cost extra and arrive lateroculus might have prospered as an independent company among other accomplishments it had already scored the most spectacular hiring coup imaginable by signing on legendary game programmer john carmack who helped create the landmark firstperson shooter doom as its cto but like instagram it has benefited from facebook ownership “we have supercharged recruiting” says iribe when i chat with him moments after the june media event in san francisco where he showed off the oculus touch controllers for the first time “we were  or  people when we got acquired and we’re plus today it’s just incredible how fast we’ve been able to grow”advertisementoculus has also taken full advantage of zuckerberg’s penchant for strategic acquisitions “we come to him and say ‘hey there’s this brilliant group of computervision scientists and if they were here and working on this feature it might be able to land in the next product or a product in two generations’ ” says iribe who has quietly snapped up five small companies since oculus officially became part of facebook in july  “and he’s like ‘okay let’s go do this’ ”as usual with a new venture zuckerberg is taking an uncommonly patient approach to making money from oculus “over the long term we need to make sure it’s sustainable” he says “but sustainable could mean selling it at breakeven and having a business around software or some other part of the platform which is actually something that we’re much better attuned to”for facebook judging oculus based on its potential is second nature “we’ve got a five to year rd road map for oculus that’s very clear about what problems we need to go take down and how we’re going to do it” schroepfer tells me “and so we’re just going to build better and better sensors and hardware and software that’s going to allow you to do more and more and that’s going to create these amazing experiences” lori goler vp people “people here want their work to matter and their contribution to matter and they want to work with an amazing team of people who challenge them every day they actually say ‘i don’t ever want to be the smartest person in the room’” not everyone is as convinced of zuckerberg’s vr dreams wall street for one is having trouble peering quite so far ahead “i worry a bit about expectations” says colin sebastian senior analyst at robert w baird “consumers have dreams of seamlessly entering these interactive environments and interacting with friends the tech is early and the virtual environments are very basic” and the competition is intense sony and htc also have vr headsets coming out next year then there’s google with its cardboard viewer that offers vr using just a smartphone and a paper case for as little as  cardboard is nowhere near as compelling as oculus but it’s cheap approachable and available right nowzuckerberg has bigger ideas in mind for what oculus could become when he discusses the company he consistently refers to “vr and ar” the latter being augmented reality the technology that layers virtual objects into the real world imagine a fictional character appearing in front of you to interact with you in your home ar underpins microsoft’s forthcoming hololens product as well as the stealthy muchbuzzedabout magic leap in october both zuckerberg and iribe confirmed publicly that oculus is indeed working on augmented reality if oculus can squeeze its technology into something that looks more like a pair of glasses and lets you see the real world as well as the virtual one “it could be the last electronics device that a lot of people need to buy” zuckerberg muses and this time around facebook would be the company selling itadvertisement“if you’re the average connected facebook user in the us you spend a dollar a day implicitly on data” sandberg explainsfacebook has succeeded because it has continuously found a way to scale—its service its business and its ambitions “the facebook of today is in so many ways exactly like the facebook of ” says vp of people lori goler who joined the company that year when it had a mere  million users and less than onetwentieth its current head count “the culture is the same the values are the same mark’s tremendous vision intellect learning mindset—all of that is the same what’s changed is we have a lot more resources now in terms of the business growing and the number of people we have to help us move the world forward”with the company now reaching almost  billion people zuckerberg can raise that last part—moving the world forward—to a new level in august  he appointed product vp naomi gleit one of the company’s longestserving employees she joined in  to manage dozens of staffers dedicated exclusively to implementing functionality that helps facebook members do good a donation tool launched last year allows users to respond to disasters by giving money a task that—facebook being facebook—it sees as an engineering problem that should be attacked through continuous iteration “i geek out on this but with the ebola campaign we asked users to select a donation amount” explains gleit “we also asked them to pick a specific charity that they wanted to donate to” this proved confusing to users and did not produce as much giving as facebook hoped “with the nepal campaign we reduced it from five steps to two” gleit says “we had a preselected donation amount and we chose multiple charities and then distributed among them equally” advertisement tools like this “maybe only can happen on facebook or can happen uniquely well on facebook” says zuckerberg who along with his wife priscilla chan a pediatrician has given  billion to various causes “i think about the organdonation listing work that we did the safety check stuff that we’ve done where  million people were notified of their friends being safe in the nepal earthquake you can only do that if you’ve mapped out what people’s relationships are and you have a sense of where people are in the world and you have a tool that they’re checking every day” he’s right facebook can indeed do things no other company canbut it can’t do anything for people who remain disconnected from the digital world “if we really want to connect everyone in the world and give everyone the ability to have a voice and share what they want with the people around them then you can’t just build the biggest internet service” zuckerberg says “you also have to help grow the internet” in  facebook enlisted nokia qualcomm samsung and other tech giants to help it found internetorg the globalconnectivity initiative dedicated to bringing the internet to the  of people worldwide who aren’t yet onlinethe effort is a hybrid of shortterm altruism and longterm capitalism “the fundamental connectivity problem is a financial one” sandberg explains “for  of the people it’s cost the world bank puts absolute poverty at about  a day one in six people live under that if you’re the average connected facebook user in the us you spend a dollar a day implicitly on data so the business models have to change and the cost needs to go down and that’s what we’re trying to do”advertisement“it’s not lost on our businesses that as economic standings improve there will be opportunities but that’s not the initial goal” adds matt grob cto of qualcomm “we’ve seen throughout the world that when you provide improved connectivity people are more able to educate their children and participate in political and government activities and sell their wares or find jobs”internetorg’s first effort—an app offering free access to facebook news search job listings and other services—is live in india indonesia pakistan the philippines south africa and  other countries facebook has deployed it in collaboration with local wireless carriers and  million people are using it but the app has received pushback on multiple grounds particularly for offering only certain curated services rather than the full unbridled internet—a violation critics say of net neutrality principlesthe debate has been particularly heated in india investor mahesh murthy charged that giving poor people free access to a sliver of the web amounted to “economic racism” and several major media companies that had joined the effort pulled out yael maguire director connectivity lab “our focus is technologies that can advance the state of the art by at least an order of magnitude we don’t want to make something better by a factor of two or three because the rest of the industry is going to do that”photo christophe wufacebook for facebook releasing something gauging reaction and then tweaking as necessary is not only normal but also a badge of honor—after all one of the company’s guiding principles is “done is better than perfect” when i ask zuckerberg about the controversy he says “internetorg is working we’ve learned a lot from our efforts already we’ve listened to a lot of feedback from people in the communities we’re connecting and have responded by making significant changes to the program” among other adjustments it’s made the app more secure and private and now lets any thirdparty service submit itself for inclusion subject to technical restrictions given time the company might get the internetorg app to a place that’s relatively uncontroversial even now it has its allies “i firmly believe that at this point some internet is better than no internet” says helani galpaya ceo of lirneasia a communications think tank based in colombo sri lankafor the places on earth where there’s currently no internet facebook and internetorg are tackling that issue too in terms of land area explains yael maguire director of facebook’s connectivity lab “there’s only  of the world that is not able to connect if they pulled out a phone the focus for this lab going back to the mission of the company is to figure out how we can connect the last ”talking with maguire you quickly see why zuckerberg entrusted him with this challenge the way he rattles off stats and facts and calmly deconstructs goals that sound nearly impossible is reminiscent of his boss’s own manner facebook opened the connectivity lab in march  and maguire and his team have concluded that the answer to their challenge is a drone—although maguire prefers the lesspoliticized though not exactly catchy term hapi link which is short for highaltitude platform internet link by charging an unmanned aerial vehicle’s battery via solar power and flying it at  to  feet above weather and conventional aircraft the company believes it could efficiently send highspeed internet access down to where it is needed via laseradvertisementfacebook began the project with more hardware engineering experience than you might imagine it started accumulating this more than a halfdecade ago when execs decided that the best way to deliver facebook reliably and efficiently to hundreds of millions of people was to construct its own data centers and fill them with its own servers that path led to the open compute project maguire’s purview at facebook prior to the connectivity lab which created powerefficient easytorepair servers that the company could install by the thousands in data centers located everywhere from prine­ville oregon to luleå sweden rather than treat its designs as proprietary facebook shared them with the rest of the industry via a notforprofit that grew to include support from apple dell hp intel and microsoft among others“when i joined we didn’t have mechanical engineers” says open compute project foundation board member frank frankovsky who headed hardware design for facebook’s servers before leaving in  to cofound a storage startup “we hired some of the best in the world and guess what drones need mechanical engineers too”the company acquired instant expertise in unmanned aeronautics in march  by plunking down  million for ascenta a uk–based startup founded by andrew cox whose previous efforts included a military drone that set a world record by staying aloft for almost two weeksadvertisementadvertisementas in the past hearing mark zuckerberg explain his vision proved to be a powerful recruiting tool “i personally called up the guy who’s leading our lasercommunications effort who was working at nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory” he recalls “and he said ‘what why are you calling me’ and i said ‘because we’re connecting the world and i want you to come in and meet the team and this is something that’s really important to me and i think we can make a big difference’ ” even in the retelling zuckerberg makes it sound urgentadvertisement advertisement fourteen months after the ascenta acquisition facebook announced that it had a fullscale prototype dubbed aquila and crafted from ultralightweight carbon fiber an empty nextgeneration boeing  airliner weighs upwards of  pounds and has a foot wingspan aquila has a foot wingspan yet weighs only  pounds the company plans to begin test flights by the end of  once the planes are manufactured facebook plans to partner with local telcos to deploy themfor all the quick progress the connectivity lab has made much remains to be done it’s still developing the battery technology necessary to keep the drone in the air for three months the company’s goal and though it’s figured out how to use lasers to transmit data at blistering speeds in the tens of gigabits per second thanks to technology borrowed from facebook’s data centers it is still ironing out the details of dronetoground communicationthen there are the faa regulations which require that every drone have a dedicated pilot on the ground controlling it a restriction that maguire says would make aquila economically unworkable the same is true of google’s project loon internet balloons the two fierce competitors are collaborating to work through some of the policy implications the solution computer science “we need good machinelearning algorithms and control algorithms” maguire says “to make it so that you have  planes per pilot or    i don’t know what the number is but somewhere between  and ” zuckerberg on facebook “very few people thought it was going to be a good business early on which is why almost no one else tried to do it” zuckerberg who personally researched and wrote a meaty unsigned facebook white paper on the state of connectivity is as usual unfazed and with  of the voting power of facebook stock in his control bouncing ideas off his board of directors is as close as he ever gets to seeking permission for his plans “the myth is that mark makes decisions and informs the board” says director andreessen “the reality is that we have very detailed discussions” as zuckerberg recalls the board asked him “ ‘you’re going to spend how many billions of dollars on this and how is this going to make money’ and i said ‘well i don’t have a direct plan now but i just believe that if we connect these folks it will be good and it will help those economies grow and those people have better lives and i think some portion of that will come back to us over some period of time’ ”zuckerberg has earned the right to trust his gut “at the beginning of facebook i didn’t have an idea of how this was going to be a good business” he tells me “i just thought it was a good thing to do” he pauses “very few people thought it was going to be a good business early on which is why almost no one else tried to do it”today everyone understands not worrying about whether facebook was a good business turned out to be a great way to do business zuckerberg has recalibrated his ambitions accordingly as andreessen tells me “this is a guy who’s  he’s got a  or year runway i don’t even know if there’s a precedent”related how does mark zuckerberg generate innovation photos pari dukovicadvertisementrelated storiesideascrispr pioneer jennifer doudna

developing computer programs especially communication tools and games in one program since his fathers dental practice was operated from their home he built a software program he called zucknet that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other it is considered a primitive version of aols instant messenger which came out the following year according to writer jose antonio vargas some kids played computer games mark created them zuckerberg himself recalls this period i had a bunch of friends who were artists theyd come over draw stuff and id build a game out of it however notes vargas zuckerberg was not a typical geekklutz as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma napster cofounder sean parker a

users listening habits which was posted to slashdot and received a rating of  out of  from pc magazine college years vargas noted that by the time zuckerberg began classes at harvard he had already achieved a reputation as a programming prodigy he studied psychology and computer science and belonged to alpha epsilon pi and kirkland house in his sophomore year he wrote a program that he called coursematch which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups a short time later he created a different program he initially called facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos according to arie hasit zuckerbergs roommate at the time he built the site for fun hasit explains we had books called face books which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms at first he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females visitors to the site had to choose who was hotter and according to the votes there would be a ranking the site went up over a weekend but by monday morning the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of harvards network switches and prevented students from accessing the internet in addition many students complained that their photos were being used without permission zuckerberg apologized publicly and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was completely improper the following semester in january  zuckerberg began writing code for a new web site on february   zuckerberg launched thefacebook originally located at thefacebookcom six days after the site launched three harvard seniors cameron winklevoss tyler winklevoss and divya narendra accused zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called harvardconnectioncom while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product the three complained to the harvard crimson and the newspaper began an investigation in responsecitation needed following the official launch of the facebook social media platform the three filed a lawsuit against zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement the agreed settlement was for  million facebook shares that were worth us million at facebooks ipo zuckerberg dropped out of harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project in january  he recalled i remember really vividly you know having pizza with my friends a day or two after—i opened up the first version of facebook at the time i thought you know someone needs to build a service like this for the world but i just never thought that wed be the ones to help do it and i think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more

woodside california february   facebook main articles facebook and history of facebook on february   zuckerberg launched facebook from his harvard dormitory room an earlier inspiration for facebook may have come from phillips exeter academy the prep school from which zuckerberg graduated in  it published its own student directory the photo address book which students referred to as the facebook such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools with them students were able to list attributes such as their class years their friends and their telephone numbers once at college zuckerbergs facebook started off as just a harvard thing until zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools enlisting the help of roommate dustin moskovitz they

zuckerberg the group planned to return to harvard but eventually decided to remain in california they had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company in an interview in

corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me he restated these goals to wired magazine in  the thing i really care about is the mission making the world open earlier in april  zuckerberg sought the advice of former netscape cfo peter currie about financing strategies for facebook on july   zuckerberg reported that the company reached the  millionuser mark when asked whether facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth he explained i guess we could  if you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query the average for us is a little less than  percent of the pages and the average for search is about  percent taken up with ads  thats the simplest thing we could do but we arent like that we make enough money right i mean we are keeping things running we are growing at the rate we want to in  steven levy who wrote the  book hackers heroes of the computer revolution wrote that

the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other” sorkin who won for best screenplay retracted some of the impressions given in his script i wanted to say to mark zuckerberg tonight if youre watching rooney maras character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie she was wrong you turned out to be a great entrepreneur a visionary and an incredible altruist on january   zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on saturday night live which was being hosted by jesse eisenberg they both said it was the first time they ever met eisenberg asked zuckerberg who had been critical of his portrayal by the film what he thought of the movie zuckerberg replied it was interesting in a subsequent interview about their meeting eisenberg explains that he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at harvard zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is false karel baloun a former senior engineer at facebook notes that the image of zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated  it is fiction  he likewise dismisses the films assertion that he would deliberately betray a friend other depictions zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of the simpsons titled loana lisa which first aired on october   in the episode lisa simpson and her friend nelson encounter zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs convention zuckerberg tells lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful referencing bill gates and richard branson as examples on october   saturday night live lampooned zuckerberg and facebook andy samberg played zuckerberg the real zuckerberg was reported to have been amused i thought this was funny stephen colbert awarded a medal of fear to zuckerberg at the rally to restore sanity andor fear on october   because he values his privacy much more than he values yours zuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film terms and conditions may apply philanthropy see also chan zuckerberg initiative chan and zuckerberg in prague  zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to diaspora an opensource personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service he called it a cool idea zuckerberg founded the startup education foundation on september   it was reported that zuckerberg had donated  million to newark public schools the public school system of newark new jersey critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of the social network which painted a somewhat negative portrait of zuckerberg zuckerberg responded to the criticism saying the thing that i was most sensitive about with the movie timing was i didnt want the press about the social network movie to get conflated with the newark project i was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate newark mayor cory booker stated that he and new jersey governor chris christie had to convince zuckerbergs team not to make the donation anonymously the money was largely wasted according to journalist dale russakoff on december   zuckerberg bill gates and investor warren buffett signed the giving pledge in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time and invited others among the wealthy to donate  percent or more of their wealth to charity on december   zuckerberg announced a donation of  million facebook shares to the silicon valley community foundation to be executed by the end of the month—based on facebooks valuation as of then the shares totaled  million in value on december   the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for  the chronicle of philanthropy placed zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazines annual list of  most generous americans for  having donated roughly  billion to charity in october  zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan donated us million to combat the ebola virus disease specifically the west african ebola virus epidemic on december   zuckerberg and chan announced the birth of their daughter max and in an open letter to max they pledged to donate  percent of their facebook shares then valued at us billion to the chan zuckerberg initiative their new organization that will focus on health and education the donation will not be given immediately but over the course of their lives however instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to as bill gates warren buffett larry page sergey brin and other tech billionaires have done zuckerberg and chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company this has drawn criticism from a number of journalists chan and zuckerberg also signed the giving pledge politics in  zuckerberg registered to vote in westchester county new york where he grew up but did not cast a ballot until november  santa clara county registrar of voters spokeswoman elma rosas told bloomberg that zuckerberg is listed as no preference on voter rolls and he voted in the past two general elections in  and  zuckerberg has never revealed his own political views some consider him a conservative while others consider him liberal on february   zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for new jersey governor chris christie zuckerbergs particular interest on this occasion was education reform and christies education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools later that year zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for newark mayor cory booker who was running in the  new jersey special senate election in september  with the support of governor chris christie booker obtained a us million pledge from zuckerberg to newark public schools in december  zuckerberg donated  million shares to the silicon valley community foundation a community organization that includes education in its list of grantmaking areas on april   zuckerberg led the launch of a c lobbying group called fwdus the founders and contributors to the group were primarily silicon valley entrepreneurs and investors and its president was joe green a close friend of zuckerberg the goals of the group include immigration reform improving the state of education in the united states and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives including drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the keystone xl pipeline in  numerous liberal and progressive groups such as the league of conservation voters moveonorg the sierra club democracy for america credo daily kos org and presente and progressives united agreed to either pull their facebook ad buys or not buy facebook ads for at least two weeks in protest of zuckerberg ads funded by fwdus that were in support of oil drilling and the keystone xl pipeline and in opposition to obamacare among republican united states senators who back immigration reformclarification needed a media report on june   revealed that zuckerberg actively engaged with facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a fwdus video in response to a claim that the fwdus organization is just about tech wanting to hire more people the internet entrepreneur replied the bigger problem we’re trying to address is ensuring the  million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly in june  zuckerberg joined facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual san francisco lesbian gay bisexual and transgender pride celebration the company first participated in the event in  with  employees and this number increased to  for the  march the  pride celebration was especially significant as it followed a us supreme court ruling that deemed the defense of marriage act doma unconstitutional when questioned about the mid prism scandal at the techcrunch disrupt conference in september  zuckerberg stated that the us government blew it he further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens the economy and companies zuckerberg placed a statement on his facebook wall on december   which said that he wants to add my voice in support of muslims in our community and around the world in response to the aftermath of the november  paris attacks and the  san bernardino attack the statement also said that muslims are always welcome on facebook and that his position was a result of the fact that as a jew my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities on february   zuckerberg sent out a companywide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten black lives matter phrases on the company walls and had written all lives matter in their place facebook allows employees to freewrite thoughts and phrases on company walls the memo was then leaked by several employees as zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at facebook zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful but malicious as well according to zuckerbergs memo black lives matter doesnt mean other lives dont  its simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve the memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself means silencing speech or that one persons speech is more important than anothers zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents the new york daily news interviewed facebook employees who commented anonymously that zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase black lives matter must exist as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure  in january  zuckerberg criticized donald trump’s executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries personal life zuckerberg met his future wife fellow student priscilla chan at a fraternity party during his sophomore year at harvard they began dating in  in september  zuckerberg invited chan by then a medical student at the university of california san

guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told

he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide

network was released on october   and stars jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg after zuckerberg was told about the film he responded i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive also after the films script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told new york magazine i dont want my fidelity to be the truth i want it to be storytelling adding what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor

he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at harvard zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is false karel baloun

initially called facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos according to arie hasit zuckerbergs roommate at the time he built the site for fun hasit explains we had books called face books which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms at first he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females visitors to the site had to choose who was hotter and according to the votes there would be a ranking the site went up over a weekend but by monday morning the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of harvards network switches and prevented students from accessing the internet in addition many students complained that their photos were being used without permission

lawsuit against zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement the agreed settlement was for  million facebook shares that were worth us million at facebooks ipo zuckerberg dropped out of harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project in january  he recalled i remember really vividly you know having pizza with my friends a day or two after—i opened up the first version of facebook at the time

projects at the time among which was facemash the predecessor of facebook but did not register the domain name thefacebookcom until january   facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as completely frivolous facebook spokesman barry schnitt told a reporter that ceglias counsel had unsuccessfully sought an outofcourt settlement on october   federal authorities arrested ceglia charging him with mail and wire fraud and of tampering with destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the facebook founder of billions of dollars ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of facebook although after examining their emails investigators found there was no mention of facebook in them some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after ceglias arrest palestinian terror attacks on july   israeli cabinet minister gilad erdan accused zuckerberg of having some responsibility for deadly attacks by palestinians against israelis according to him the social network was not doing enough to ban posts to its platform that incite violence against israelis some of the victims blood is on zuckerbergs hands erdan said hawaiian land ownership in january  zuckerberg filed eight quiet title and partition lawsuits against hundreds of native hawaiians to get them to sell their land to him this land is contained within the  acres of land in the hawaiian island of kauai that zuckerberg had purchased in  when he learned that hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other  states he dropped the lawsuits depictions in media the social network main article the social network a movie based on zuckerberg and the founding years of facebook the social network was released on october   and stars jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg after zuckerberg was told about the film he responded i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive also after the films script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told new york magazine i dont want my fidelity to be the truth i want it to be storytelling adding what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other” sorkin who won for best screenplay retracted some of the impressions given in his script i wanted to say to mark zuckerberg tonight if youre watching rooney maras character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie she was wrong you turned out to be a great entrepreneur a visionary and an incredible altruist on january   zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on saturday night live which was being hosted by jesse eisenberg they both said it was the first time they ever met eisenberg asked zuckerberg who had been critical of his portrayal by the film what he thought of the movie zuckerberg replied it was interesting in a subsequent interview about their meeting eisenberg explains that he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at harvard zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is false karel baloun a former senior engineer at facebook notes that the image of zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated  it is fiction  he likewise dismisses the films assertion that he would deliberately betray a friend other depictions zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of the simpsons titled loana lisa which first aired on october   in the episode lisa simpson and her friend nelson encounter zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs convention zuckerberg tells lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful referencing bill gates and richard branson as examples on october   saturday night live lampooned zuckerberg and facebook andy samberg played zuckerberg the real zuckerberg was reported to have been amused i thought this was funny stephen colbert awarded a medal of fear to zuckerberg at the rally to restore sanity andor fear on october   because he values his privacy much more than he values yours zuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film terms and conditions may apply philanthropy see also chan zuckerberg initiative chan and zuckerberg in prague  zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to diaspora an opensource personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service he called it a cool idea zuckerberg founded the startup education foundation on september   it was reported that zuckerberg had donated  million to newark public schools the public school system of newark new jersey critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of the social network which painted a somewhat negative portrait of zuckerberg zuckerberg responded to the criticism saying the thing that i was most sensitive about with the movie timing was i didnt want the press about the social network movie to get conflated with the newark project i was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate newark mayor cory booker stated that he and new jersey governor chris christie had to convince zuckerbergs team not to make the donation anonymously the money was largely wasted according to journalist dale russakoff on december   zuckerberg bill gates and investor warren buffett signed the giving pledge in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time and invited others among the wealthy to donate  percent or more of their wealth to charity on december   zuckerberg announced a donation of  million facebook shares to the silicon valley community foundation to be executed by the end of the month—based on

not be given immediately but over the course of their lives however instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to as bill gates warren buffett larry page sergey brin and other tech billionaires have done zuckerberg and chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company this has drawn criticism from a number of journalists chan and zuckerberg also signed the giving pledge politics in  zuckerberg registered to vote in westchester county new york where he grew up but did not cast a ballot until november  santa clara county registrar of voters spokeswoman elma rosas told bloomberg that zuckerberg is listed as no preference on voter rolls and he voted in the past two general elections in  and  zuckerberg has never revealed his own political

presente and progressives united agreed to either pull their facebook ad buys or not buy facebook ads for at least two weeks in protest of zuckerberg ads funded by fwdus that were in support of oil drilling and the keystone xl pipeline and in opposition to obamacare among republican united states senators who back immigration reformclarification needed a media report on june   revealed that zuckerberg actively engaged with facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a fwdus video in response to a claim that the fwdus organization is just about tech wanting to hire more people the internet entrepreneur replied the bigger problem we’re trying to address is ensuring the  million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly in june  zuckerberg joined facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual san francisco lesbian gay bisexual and transgender pride celebration the company first participated in the event in  with  employees and this number increased to  for the  march the  pride celebration was especially significant as it followed a us supreme court ruling that deemed the

which said that he wants to add my voice in support of muslims in our community and around the world in response to the aftermath of the november  paris attacks and the  san bernardino attack the

communities on february   zuckerberg sent out a companywide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten black lives matter phrases on the company walls and had written all lives matter in their place facebook allows employees to freewrite thoughts and phrases on company walls the memo was then leaked by several employees as zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at facebook zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful but malicious as well according to zuckerbergs memo black lives matter doesnt mean other lives dont  its simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve the memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself means silencing speech or that one persons speech is more important than anothers zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents the new york daily news interviewed facebook employees who commented anonymously that zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase black lives matter must exist as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure  in january  zuckerberg criticized donald trump’s executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries personal life zuckerberg met his future wife fellow student

network was released on october   and stars jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg after zuckerberg was told about the film he responded i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive also after the films script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told new york magazine i dont want my fidelity to be the truth i want it to be storytelling adding what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor

he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature

network was released on october   and stars jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg after zuckerberg was told about the film he responded i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive also after the films script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told new york magazine i dont want my fidelity to be the truth i want it to be storytelling adding what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor

he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature

product feedback cancel facebook founder mark zuckerbergs unexpected management genius main menu fortunecom subscribe by adam lashinsky photo courtesy of facebook november    am edt the unexpected management genius of facebook’s mark zuckerberg here’s what you can learn from fortune’s businessperson of the year the first time i interviewed mark zuckerberg back in  he was all of  years old and could have passed for  he had recently dropped out of harvard to move his startup to silicon valley and was obviously enjoying the novelty of being called ceo facebook’s website—there was no mobile version yet—had  million users and was open exclusively to high school and college students it had only just added a feature allowing users to upload multiple photos to their profiles but the company was already a hot commodity valued at  million and coveted by buyers who were willing to pay far more and despite his callowness it was obvious that zuckerberg was an entrepreneur who was as i wrote at the time “preternaturally levelheaded” if there was one point zuckerberg was most forceful about that day it was this he wasn’t the least bit interested in selling his yearold company “i’m in this to build something cool not to get bought” he said with a bloodless sincerity that was altogether convincing eleven years later zuckerberg no  businessperson of the year has built something beyond cool he has willed into being a global phenomenon facebook fb is a nearly employee media powerhouse worth  billion—and also an advertisingtechnology juggernaut on track to annual revenues of more than  billion in  and gaudy profits of  billion its core product now has  billion users and zuckerberg has shrewdly assembled a portfolio of properties to buttress facebook the complete “family of apps” includes the photosharing tool instagram and the communications service whatsapp plus two homegrown apps facebook messenger and facebook groups in addition zuckerberg believes the company’s oculus virtualreality headset represents the next way people will communicate with one another zuckerberg brohugs president obama at an entrepreneurship summit at stanford in junephoto kevin lamarque—reuters via zuma press facebook’s immense accomplishments already have conferred superstar status on zuckerberg inviting comparisons to the likes of bill gates steve jobs and jeff bezos at  he is as freshfaced and casually dressed as a decade ago yet today the facebook ceo is a celebrity wherever he goes he huddles with presidents prime ministers and the pope he is photographed jogging in beijing and barcelona this year he ran his first halfmarathon together with his physician wife priscilla chan he has become one of the world’s most ambitious philanthropists most recently pledging  billion to an initiative with an audacious goal to cure prevent or make manageable all diseases in their children’s lifetime click to enlarge zuckerberg is rightly recognized for his outsize success nevertheless he is surprisingly underappreciated for his business acumen yes he has delegated the commercial aspects of facebook to sheryl sandberg facebook’s polished chief operating officer a harvard mba who is  years zuckerberg’s senior sandberg’s presence has fostered an “adult supervision” narrative familiar to the valley but unlike say the google googl founders who turned over the ceo job to eric schmidt for a decade zuckerberg has remained chief executive throughout facebook’s year sprint to greatness despite repeated doubts—when facebook missed the shift to smartphones when it was thought to have botched its ipo when it was seen as losing its luster with young people—zuckerberg has remained the company’s chief product visionary and business strategist through bold acquisitions and the articulation of a remarkably constant mission zuckerberg has kept facebook on track in the face of fullfrontal assaults from the likes of google twitter twtr  snapchat and others admirers attribute zuckerberg’s business success to his inquisitive nature as well as to his relatively grounded approach to technology “he’s always been a learnitall person to a level that is sometimes maddening considering how much more i have to learn from him than he does from me” says matt cohler a venture capitalist at benchmark and an early facebook employee who has remained close to zuckerberg “he maintains a relentless focus on innovation but at the same time he’s an appliedscience and engineering guy” what zuckerberg has engineered at facebook is growth that is astounding considering the size of the company for four years running it has grown revenues at a  clip while profits have jumped fivefold unsurprisingly facebook’s stock has followed suit doubling in two years in its most recent quarter facebook increased its revenues  over the year before and its net income  and yet the stock dipped on the news as some investors expressed fears the company won’t be able to keep up the scorching pace zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan meeting pope francis in augustphoto courtesy of facebook growing at scale is the holy grail of business leadership—and this feat alone makes zuckerberg an easy choice for fortune’s businessperson of the year for  facebook’s products are frequently dissected as are its missteps as a reluctant media titan facebook seems to enjoy the financial fruits of advertising dominance far more than the editorial responsibilities that go with it yet for all the celebration of facebook’s success and the adulation of zuckerberg as a visionary what’s less well understood is how he goes about his day job as an executive what makes him so effective as a businessperson an examination of zuckerberg’s management approach reveals that his success rests on three pillars his unique ability to look into the future his otherworldly consistency and the business discipline he has nurtured in an industry quite often enamored of bright shiny objects a closer look reveals just how levelheaded he has remained over the years being a visionary is harder than it looks mike vernal graduated from harvard in  a few months before zuckerberg arrived on campus and took a job at microsoft msft  five years later he joined facebook as an engineer and later rose to head the company’s search local and marketplace product groups reporting to zuckerberg earlier this year he left facebook to become a venture capitalist—meaning his new job is to find the next mark zuckerberg having watched facebook’s ceo up close vernal believes the key to zuckerberg’s success is his ability to think for the ages while knowing when to go deep “one of the things that defines mark is that he takes a very very long view of things almost a geological view” says vernal “most people think day to day or week to week mark thinks century to century” indeed zuckerberg’s favorite video game is civilization which allows players to consider the vast sweep of history while plotting their next move somewhat less grandiosely vernal cites zuckerberg’s audacious yearandbeyond quest to connect the half of the planet that doesn’t yet use the internet facebook’s plan to do this involves fixedwing drones that will deliver connectivity from high above the earth vernal says zuckerberg typically has a pile of books on his desk visible to all through the glass walls that surround it “for a while there was a book on freespace optical communications” says vernal referring to a technology facebook is pursuing that will beam signals from the atmosphere “it is telling about mark’s personality that he reads a college textbook on freespace optics” zuckerberg inspecting aquila a solarpowered fixedwing drone before a test flight in arizona in july facebook plans to use the aircraft which can stay airborne for up to  days at a time to beam down internet signals to people in remote areas of the globe as part of the company’s mission to make the world more connectedphoto courtesy of facebook an introvert given to long stares and awkward silences zuckerberg does more than think deeply where ceos with more emotional intelligence rely on their gifts for gab facebook’s ceo attributes his management technique to his training as an engineer “for me engineering comes down to two real principles” he told a group of nigerian software developers this summer the “engineering mindset” he said dictates thinking “of every problem as a system” and breaking down problems “from the biggest stage down to smaller pieces” over time zuckerberg told his rapt audience in lagos “you get to the point where you’re running a company” itself a complicated system segmented into groups of highfunctioning people “instead of managing individuals you’re managing teams and if you’ve built it well then it’s not so different from writing code” a consistent message helps rally the troops zuckerberg has proved adept at selecting talent relying on a core of top executives who have been at facebook for much of its existence he claims to draw more inspiration from his coterie of senior managers than from any mentor or adviser while he retains his reputation as a boygenius coder in reality zuckerberg is something of a grinder—a  perspiration guy who has surrounded himself with a group of people he respects and with whom he is constantly stresstesting his hypotheses “ideas typically do not just come to you” he said in a  public qa session at facebook “they happen because you’ve been talking about something or thinking about something and talking to a lot of people about it for a long period of time” at facebook’s f developers conference in april zuckerberg laid out the company’s year road map which includes continued development of artificial intelligence and virtual realityphoto courtesy of facebook from such thinking came zuckerberg’s realization that three broad themes matter most to facebook connectivity his goal of bringing the internet—and the wonders of facebook of course—to those who don’t have it artificial intelligence and virtual reality what’s more because he is always pushing zuckerberg has shown an ability to recognize big ideas from others early—including when facebook has been late—and has been able to act with bold conviction to buy what others have created if necessary examples include spending  billion to buy photosharing site instagram in   billion for oculus vr two years later and  billion for whatsapp also in  instagram with estimated revenues of  billion this year already is a runaway success while at a minimum oculus and whatsapp have positioned facebook to succeed in important areas adjacent to its core product photos bosworth paul sakuma—ap cox christophe morin—ipgetty images

denis allard—rearedux systrom matt edge—the new york timesredux one of facebook’s key business innovations is a “growth team”—today made up of hundreds of people—that designs tactics for various parts of the company relying on a rigorous set of metrics to gauge success the unit has broad latitude to weigh in on any aspect of facebook’s business “the growth team’s discipline has had as big an impact on facebook as anything else” says vernal the former top product executive “the team owns no single product instead it owns any issue that is preventing people from signing up for or using facebook” silicon valley companies are now widely replicating the concept of the growth team invented at facebook patience pays even for a young company in a hurry facebook has a simple if grandiose mission “to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected” zuckerberg whose wooden public speaking style has improved with practice is mindnumbingly efficient about slipping the statement into everyday conversation as well as his speeches and interviews the repetition makes for effective external and internal messaging if something at facebook can’t be explained by the oftrepeated catchphrase then it doesn’t fit virtual reality has a place because zuckerberg thinks it’s the next “platform” for communicating just as the web was when he started facebook spending an outrageous amount of money for whatsapp—which has challenged skype as the trendiest free international calling service—was acceptable because it fit into the “open and connected” mantra a corollary to staying on message is being patient and disciplined in pursuit of the mission zuckerberg was ultrapatient with instagram which had no revenues when facebook bought it but is now booming he appears to be playing a similarly long game with whatsapp advice from the ceo the facebook founder in his own words zuckerberg often muses on management here a selection of quotes from public qas posted on facebook on who should work at facebook in terms of attracting people i think one of the most important things is just being upfront about what you stand for facebook is not a company for everyone we believe that the world will be better when everyone has the ability to share what they think and to be able to connect to their friends and to be able to connect to the whole world i believe very strongly that that’s good for the world and if you believe that then facebook is a good company for you and if you don’t then maybe find a different one on experimentation in a lot of ways building a company is like following the scientific method you try a bunch of different hypotheses and if you set up the experiments well then you kind of learn what to do… we invest in this huge testing framework at any given point in time there’s not just one version of facebook running in the world there’re probably tens of thousands of versions running because engineers here have the power to try out an idea and ship it to maybe  people or  people and then they get a readout on the value of surrounding oneself with talented people if you’re in an environment where you’re not learning as much as you think you should be if you don’t have the people around you who you think are going to inspire you to do the best work that you can then think about changing something because that’s a big deal on resisting the temptation for a quick fix when hiring over the long term you’re really only going to be better off if you get someone really good i’ve developed over time a simple rule which is that i will only hire someone to work directly for me if i would work for that person indeed zuckerberg’s achievement in guiding facebook to where it is today owes as much to what he hasn’t done as to what he has unlike alphabet google’s parent facebook harbors no separate unit for “moon shots” it isn’t attempting to reinvent contact lenses or autonomous vehicles zuckerberg may have pledged part of his immense wealth to fighting disease—his facebook stake is worth nearly  billion—but his company has no subsidiary attempting to reverse the effects of aging so he’s disciplined collaborative consistent generous and at least outwardly humble he’s even a progressive role model when his daughter maxima was born just after thanksgiving last year zuckerberg took a twomonth paternity leave zuckerberg is also big on personal goals having committed in the past to learning mandarin and this year to designing his own aifueled personal assistant named jarvis for his home he recently told an audience in rome that through jarvis he can control the house’s temperature but that “much to the chagrin of my wife” she cannot “because it is programmed to only listen to my voice which is one of the perks of being an engineer” he added “i’ll give her access once i’m done” as ever zuckerberg is determined to build the next cool thing his way even if it means a little domestic friction a version of this

biggest risk is not taking any risk in a world that changing really quickly the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks mark zuckerberg risk world strategy i think a simple rule of business is if you do the things that are easier first then you can actually make a lot of progress mark zuckerberg business progress simple our goal is not to build a platform its to be cross all of them mark zuckerberg goal build our when i started facebook from my dorm room in  the idea that my roommates and i talked about all the time was a world that was more open mark zuckerberg time world more facebook is really about communicating and telling stories we think that people can really help spread awareness of organ donation and that they want to participate in this to their friends and that can be a big part of helping solve the crisis thats out there mark zuckerberg friends help people i wear the same outfit or at least a different copy of it almost every day mark zuckerberg day every day copy facebook was not originally created to be a company it was built to accomplish a social mission  to make the world more open and connected mark zuckerberg world mission company a frustration i have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers i think its the most ridiculous concept mark zuckerberg business advertising no one has done a study on this as far as i can tell but i think facebook might be the first place where a large number of people have come out we didnt create that  society was generally ready for that i think this is just part of the general trend that we talked about about society being more open and i think thats good mark zuckerberg good society people i actually do think youre seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging and so i think home depot will want to humanize itself i think thats a lot of why companies are starting blogs are just giving more insight into whats going on with them mark zuckerberg home caring giving move fast and break things unless you are breaking stuff you are not moving fast enough mark zuckerberg moving fast you advertising works most effectively when its in line with what people are already trying to do and people are trying to communicate in a certain way on facebook  they share information with their friends they learn about what their friends are doing  so theres really a whole new opportunity for a new type of advertising model within that mark zuckerberg opportunity friends trying figuring out what the next big trend is tells us what we should focus on mark zuckerberg focus big trend top  mark zuckerberg quotes view the list back you know a few generations ago people didnt have a way to share information and express their opinions efficiently to a lot of people but now they do right now with social networks and other tools on the internet all of these  million people have a way to say what theyre thinking and have their voice be heard mark zuckerberg thinking information know i feel that the best companies are started not because the founder wanted a company but because the founder wanted to change the world if you decide you want to found a company you maybe start to develop your first idea and hire lots of workers mark zuckerberg change best world when you give everyone a voice and give people power the system usually ends up in a really good place so what we view our role as is giving people that power mark zuckerberg good power giving by giving people the power to share were making the world more transparent mark zuckerberg power world giving there are good examples of companies  cocacola is one  that invested before there was a huge market in countries and i think that ended up playing out to their benefit for decades to come mark zuckerberg good think up the basis of our partnership strategy and our partnership approach we build the social technology they provide the music mark zuckerberg music technology strategy the question isnt what do we want to know about people its what do people want to tell about themselves mark zuckerberg know people want think about what people are doing on facebook today theyre keeping up with their friends and family but theyre also building an image and identity for themselves which in a sense is their brand theyre connecting with the audience that they want to connect to its almost a disadvantage if youre not on it now mark zuckerberg family today friends the companies that work are the ones that people really care about and have a vision for the world so do something you like mark zuckerberg work vision world i mean weve built a lot of products that we think are good and will help people share photos and share videos and write messages to each other but its really all about how people are spreading facebook around the world in all these different countries and thats whats so amazing about the scale that its at today mark zuckerberg today good amazing i think that people just have this core desire to express who they are and i think thats always existed mark zuckerberg people think desire i do everything on my phone as a lot of people do mark zuckerberg people everything phone people at facebook are fairly used to the press

inspirational person life lessons from warren buffett to being a more compassionate writer              i learn many things from warren  lose money and i will forgive you but lose even a shred of reputation and i will be ruthlessthis has been echoed across the business world for years and it applies to us all life is too short to cut corners to make an extra buck wealth can always be recreated but reputation takes a lifetime to build and often only a moment to destroy as warren says “we will not trade reputation for money” in the world of blogging i am writing because i love it it’s not for the money this makes reputation more important than anything remember this when you are contemplating rushing to monetize your site by filling it with ads links etc           go to bed a little wiser than when you woke up this is the crux of the whole meeting life is about learning if you are always learning you can never lose keep this as your only rule for the day and the world will be yours for the taking next i celebrate wealth only when it’s been fairly won and wisely used the goal is not to make money at all costs it’s easy to forget that in a lot of industries and subcultures around the world where everyone is in constant competition and this can especially be the case when so many of us spend hours upon hours writing and developing our web services for free do not rush it and do not get greedy help others and the fruit will be there wealth is worthless if you’ve destroyed all your relationships to attain it take the high road it’s far less crowded a bit sad but often true makes it pretty easy to stand out                 if you are modest and disciplined  you will surely like the principles of buffett because he himself is known for that  modesty that why he still lives in a home he bought back in s he is a man who inspired me when he stunned the world by announcing that he would give his fortune  billion to bill  melinda gates foundation to help the poorest people in the

he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to

zuckerbergs career in  seconds the daily telegraph zuckerberg was born in  in white plains new york he is the son of karen née kempner a psychiatrist and edward zuckerberg a dentist his ancestors came from germany austria and poland he and his three sisters randi donna and arielle were brought up in dobbs ferry new york a small westchester county village about  miles north of midtown manhattan zuckerberg was raised jewish and had his bar mitzvah when he turned  at ardsley high school zuckerberg excelled in classes he transferred to the exclusive private school phillips exeter academy in new hampshire in his junior year where he won prizes in science math astronomy and physics and classical studies in his youth he also attended the johns hopkins center for talented youth summer camp on his college application zuckerberg claimed that he could read and write french hebrew latin and ancient greek he was captain of the fencing team software developer early years zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school his father taught him atari basic programming in the s and later hired software developer david newman to tutor him privately newman calls him a prodigy adding that it was tough to stay ahead of him zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at mercy college near his home while still in high school he enjoyed developing computer programs especially communication tools and games in one program since his fathers dental practice was operated from their home he built a software program he called zucknet that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other it is considered a primitive version of aols instant messenger which came out the following year according to writer jose antonio vargas some kids played computer games mark created them zuckerberg himself recalls this period i had a bunch of friends who were artists theyd come over draw stuff and id build a game out of it however notes vargas zuckerberg was not a typical geekklutz as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma napster cofounder sean parker a close friend notes that zuckerberg was really into greek odysseys and all that stuff recalling how he once quoted lines from the roman epic poem aeneid by virgil during a facebook product conference during zuckerbergs high school years he worked under the company name intelligent media group to build a music player called the synapse media player the device used machine learning to learn the users listening habits which was posted to slashdot and received a rating of  out of  from pc magazine college years vargas noted that by the time zuckerberg began classes at harvard he had already achieved a reputation as a programming prodigy he studied psychology and computer science and belonged to alpha epsilon pi and kirkland house in his sophomore year he wrote a program that he called coursematch which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups a short time later he created a different program he initially called facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos according to arie hasit zuckerbergs roommate at the time he built the site for fun hasit explains we had books called face books which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms at first he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females visitors to the site had to choose who was hotter and according to the votes there would be a ranking the site went up over a weekend but by monday morning the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of harvards network switches and prevented students from accessing the internet in addition many students complained that their photos were being used without permission zuckerberg apologized publicly and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was completely improper the following semester in january  zuckerberg began writing code for a new web site on february   zuckerberg launched thefacebook originally located at thefacebookcom six days after the site launched three harvard seniors cameron winklevoss tyler winklevoss and divya narendra accused zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called harvardconnectioncom while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product the three complained to the harvard crimson and the newspaper began an investigation in responsecitation needed following the official launch of the facebook social media platform the three filed a lawsuit against zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement the agreed settlement was for  million facebook shares that were worth us million at facebooks ipo zuckerberg dropped out of harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project in january  he recalled i remember really vividly you know having pizza with my friends a day or two after—i opened up the first version of facebook at the time i thought you know someone needs to build a service like this for the world but i just never thought that wed be the ones to help do it and i think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more zuckerberg later received an honorary degree from harvard on  may  career zuckerberg listening to president barack obama before a private meeting where obama dined with technology business leaders in woodside california february   facebook main articles facebook and history of facebook on february   zuckerberg launched facebook from his harvard dormitory room an earlier inspiration for facebook may have come from phillips exeter academy the prep school from which zuckerberg graduated in  it published its own student directory the photo address book which students referred to as the facebook such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools with them students were able to list attributes such as their class years their friends and their telephone numbers once at college zuckerbergs facebook started off as just a harvard thing until zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools enlisting the help of roommate dustin moskovitz they began with columbia university new york university stanford dartmouth cornell university of pennsylvania brown and yale samyr laine a triple jumper representing haiti at the  summer olympics shared a room with zuckerberg during facebooks founding mark was clearly on to great things said laine who was facebooks fourteenth user zuckerberg moskovitz and some friends moved to palo alto california in silicon valley where they leased a small house that served as an office over the summer zuckerberg met peter thiel who invested in the company they got their first office in mid according to zuckerberg the group planned to return to harvard but eventually decided to remain in california they had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company in an interview in  zuckerberg explained his reasoning its not because of the amount of money for me and my colleagues the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me he restated these goals to wired magazine in  the thing i really care about is the mission making the world open earlier in april  zuckerberg sought the advice of former netscape cfo peter currie about financing strategies for facebook on july   zuckerberg reported that the company reached the  millionuser mark when asked whether facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth he explained i guess we could  if you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query the average for us is a little less than  percent of the pages and the average for search is about  percent taken up with ads  thats the simplest thing we could do but we arent like that we make enough money right i mean we are keeping things running we are growing at the rate we want to in  steven levy who wrote the  book hackers heroes of the computer revolution wrote that zuckerberg clearly thinks of himself as a hacker zuckerberg said that its ok to break things to make them better facebook instituted hackathons held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project the company provided music food and beer at the hackathons and many facebook staff members including zuckerberg regularly attended the idea is that you can build something really good in a night zuckerberg told levy and thats part of the personality of facebook now  its definitely very core to my personality vanity fair magazine named zuckerberg number  on its  list of the top  most influential people of the information age zuckerberg ranked number  on the vanity fair  list in  in  zuckerberg was chosen as number  in new statesmans annual survey of the worlds  most influential figures in a  interview with pbs shortly after the death of steve jobs zuckerberg said that jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at facebook that was focused on building as high quality and good things as you are on october   zuckerberg visited russian prime minister dmitry medvedev in moscow to stimulate social media innovation in russia

network was released on october   and stars jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg after zuckerberg was told about the film he responded i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive also after the films script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told new york magazine i dont want my fidelity to be the truth i want it to be storytelling adding what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other” sorkin who won for best screenplay retracted some of the impressions given in his script i wanted to say to mark

he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at harvard zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is false karel baloun

portrait of zuckerberg zuckerberg responded to the criticism saying the thing that i was most sensitive about with the movie timing was i didnt want the press about the social network movie to get conflated with the newark project i was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate newark mayor cory booker stated that he and new jersey governor chris

while still in high school he enjoyed developing computer programs especially communication tools and games in one program since his fathers dental practice was operated from their home he built a software program he called zucknet that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other it is considered a primitive version of aols instant messenger which came out the following year according to writer jose antonio vargas some kids played computer games mark created them zuckerberg himself recalls this period i had a bunch of friends who were artists theyd come over draw stuff and id build a game out of it however notes vargas zuckerberg was not a typical geekklutz as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma napster cofounder sean parker a close friend notes that zuckerberg was really into greek odysseys and all that stuff recalling how he once quoted lines from the roman epic poem aeneid by virgil during a facebook product conference during zuckerbergs high school years he worked under the company name intelligent media group to build a music player called the synapse media player the device used machine learning to learn the users listening habits which was posted to slashdot and received a rating of  out of  from pc magazine college years vargas noted that by the time zuckerberg began classes at harvard he had already achieved a reputation as a programming prodigy he studied psychology and computer science and belonged to alpha epsilon pi and kirkland house in his sophomore year he wrote a program that he called coursematch which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups a short time later he created a different program he initially called facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos according to arie hasit zuckerbergs roommate at the time he built the site for fun hasit explains we had books called face books which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms at first he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females visitors to the site had to choose who was hotter and according to the votes there would be a ranking the site went up over a weekend but by monday morning the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one of harvards network switches and prevented students from accessing the internet in addition many students complained that their photos were being used without permission zuckerberg apologized publicly and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was completely improper the following semester in january  zuckerberg began writing code for a new web site on february   zuckerberg launched thefacebook originally located at thefacebookcom six days after the site launched three harvard seniors cameron winklevoss tyler winklevoss and divya narendra accused zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called harvardconnectioncom while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product the three complained to the harvard crimson and the newspaper began an investigation in responsecitation needed following the official launch of the facebook social media platform the three filed a lawsuit against zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement the agreed settlement was for  million facebook shares that were worth us million at facebooks ipo zuckerberg dropped out of harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project in january  he recalled i remember really vividly you know having pizza with my friends a day or two after—i opened up the first version of facebook at the time i thought you know someone needs to build a service like this for the world but i just never thought that wed be the ones to help do it and i think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more zuckerberg later received an honorary degree from harvard on  may  career zuckerberg listening to president barack obama before a private meeting where obama dined with technology business leaders in woodside california february   facebook main articles facebook and history of facebook on february   zuckerberg launched facebook from his harvard dormitory room an earlier inspiration for facebook may have come from phillips exeter academy the prep school from which zuckerberg graduated in  it published its own student directory the photo address book which students referred to as the facebook such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools with them students were able to list attributes such as their class years their friends and their telephone numbers once at college zuckerbergs facebook started off as just a harvard thing until zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools enlisting the help of roommate dustin moskovitz they began with columbia university new york university stanford dartmouth cornell university of pennsylvania brown and yale samyr laine a triple jumper representing haiti at the  summer olympics shared a room with zuckerberg during facebooks founding mark was clearly on to great things said laine who was facebooks fourteenth user zuckerberg moskovitz and some friends moved to palo alto california in silicon valley where they leased a small house that served as an office over the summer zuckerberg met peter thiel who invested in the company they got their first office in mid according to zuckerberg the group planned to return to harvard but eventually decided to remain in california they had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company in an interview in  zuckerberg explained his reasoning its not because of the amount of money for me and my colleagues the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me he restated these goals to wired magazine in  the thing i really care about is the mission making the world open earlier in april  zuckerberg sought the advice of former netscape cfo peter currie about financing strategies for facebook on july   zuckerberg reported that the company reached the  millionuser mark when asked whether facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth he explained i guess we could  if you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query the average for us is a little less than  percent of the pages and the average for search is about  percent taken up with ads  thats the simplest thing we could do but we arent like that we make enough money right i mean we are keeping things running we are growing at the rate we want to in  steven levy who wrote the  book hackers heroes of the computer revolution wrote that zuckerberg clearly thinks of himself as a hacker zuckerberg said that its ok to break things to make them better facebook instituted hackathons held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project the company provided music food and beer at the hackathons and many facebook staff members including zuckerberg regularly

network was released on october   and stars jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg after zuckerberg was told about the film he responded i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive also after the films script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a good guy the film is based on the book the accidental billionaires by ben mezrich which the books publicist once described as big juicy fun rather than reportage the films screenwriter aaron sorkin told new york magazine i dont want my fidelity to be the truth i want it to be storytelling adding what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracys sake and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january   producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other” sorkin who won for best screenplay retracted some of the impressions given in his script i wanted to say to mark zuckerberg tonight if youre watching rooney maras character makes a prediction at the beginning of the movie she was wrong you turned out to be a great entrepreneur a visionary and an incredible altruist on january   zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on saturday night live which was being hosted by jesse eisenberg they both said it was the first time they ever met eisenberg asked zuckerberg who had been critical of his portrayal by the film what he thought of the movie zuckerberg replied it was interesting in a subsequent interview about their meeting eisenberg explains that he was nervous to meet him because i had spent now a year and a half thinking about him  he adds mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable  the fact that he would do snl and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous it’s the best possible way to handle something that i think could otherwise be very uncomfortable disputed accuracy jeff jarvis author of the book public parts interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story he states thats what the internet is accused of doing making stuff up not caring about the facts according to david kirkpatrick former technology editor at fortune magazine and author of the facebook effectthe inside story of the company that is connecting the world  the film is only  true  he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way the way zuckerberg is played in the movie he says that a lot of the factual incidents are accurate but many are distorted and the overall impression is false and concludes that primarily his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet although the film portrays zuckerbergs creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at harvard zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is false karel baloun a former senior engineer at facebook notes that the image of zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated  it is fiction  he likewise dismisses the films assertion that he would deliberately betray a friend other depictions zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of the simpsons titled loana lisa which first aired on october   in the episode lisa simpson and her friend nelson encounter zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs convention zuckerberg tells lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful referencing bill gates and richard branson as examples on

to newark public schools the public school system of newark new jersey critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of the social network which painted a somewhat negative portrait of zuckerberg zuckerberg responded to the criticism saying the thing that i was most sensitive about with the movie timing was i didnt want the press about the social network movie to get conflated with the newark project i was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate newark mayor cory booker stated that he and new jersey governor chris christie had to convince zuckerbergs team not to make the donation anonymously the money was largely wasted according to journalist dale russakoff on december   zuckerberg bill gates and investor

not be given immediately but over the course of their lives however instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to as bill gates warren buffett larry page sergey brin and other tech billionaires have done zuckerberg and chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company this has drawn criticism from a number of journalists chan and zuckerberg also signed the giving pledge politics in  zuckerberg registered to vote in westchester county new york where he grew up but did not cast a ballot until november  santa clara county registrar of voters

zuckerberg actively engaged with facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a fwdus video in response to a claim that the fwdus organization is just about tech wanting to

treated fairly in june  zuckerberg joined facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual san francisco lesbian gay bisexual and transgender pride celebration the company first

condemned this practice at previous company meetings and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at facebook zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful but malicious as well according to zuckerbergs memo black lives matter doesnt mean other lives dont  its simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve the memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself means silencing speech or that one persons speech is more important than anothers zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents the new york daily news interviewed facebook employees who commented anonymously that zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase black lives matter must exist as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and
