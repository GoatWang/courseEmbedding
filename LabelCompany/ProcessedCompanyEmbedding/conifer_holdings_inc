property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and except for certain regulatory considerations there are relatively few barriers to entry in this fragmented market we compete with both large national insurance providers and smaller regional specialty insurance companies on the basis of customer service coverages offered claims handling price agent commission and financial strength ratings many of our competitors have higher ratings more capital greater resources and additional access to capital than we do they may offer a wider range of products and services than we do and may cover larger geographic markets it is possible that new entrants to our markets may arise and create additional competition leading to potentially lower prices andor higher limits offered to remain competitive our strategies includes among other measures i focusing on underserved markets ii maintaining a deep understanding of the business and regulatory landscape of our markets iii placing an emphasis on flexibility in both the markets in which compete and writing policies on an admitted and es basis iv focusing on strong relationships with our agents v increasing our premiums written in existing markets vi expanding geographically in a prudent manner viii engaging in complementary acquisitions and ix emphasizing a conservative risk management approach company description conifer holdings inc is a michiganbased insurance holding company formed in  through our insurance subsidiaries we offer insurance coverage in both specialty commercial and specialty personal product lines many of our products are targeted to profitable classes of policyholders that are underserved by other insurers we market and sell these insurance products through a growing network of over  independent agents that distribute our policies through their approximately  sales offices writing business in  states we are focused on growing our business in noncommoditized property and casualty insurance markets while maintaining underwriting discipline and a conservative investment strategy our commercial lines and personal lines business accounted for  and  respectively of net earned premiums for the three months ended march   and  and  respectively of our net earned premiums for the year ended december   we have substantial expertise in serving the unique commercial insurance needs of owneroperated businesses in the following markets  hospitality such as restaurants bars taverns and bowling centers that require among other lines liquor liability insurance as well as small grocery and convenience stores  artisan contractors such as plumbers painters carpenters electricians and other independent contractors  security service providers such as companies that provide security guard services security alarm products and services and private investigative services and  automobile repair and used car facilities in our commercial lines business we seek to differentiate ourselves and provide value to small business owneroperators by bundling different insurance products that meet a significant portion of their insurance needs for example in the hospitality market we offer property casualty and liquor liability as well as in some jurisdictions workers compensation coverage the breadth of our specialty commercial insurance products enables our small business customers many of whom do not have dedicated risk management personnel and their agents to save the administrative costs and time required to seek coverage for these items from separate insurers as such we compete for commercial lines business based on our flexible product offerings and customer service rather than on pricing alone our target commercial lines customer has an average account size of  in premium we also have substantial expertise in providing specialty homeowners insurance products to targeted customers that are often underserved by larger carriers or other established providers of homeowners insurance our personal lines products include primarily the following  catastrophic coverage including hurricane and wind coverage to underserved homeowners in florida hawaii and texas and  dwelling insurance tailored for owners of lower value homes which we currently offer in illinois and indiana and plan to introduce in other geographic markets including texas louisiana north carolina and south carolina in our personal lines business we target homeowners in need of specific catastrophe coverage or dwelling insurance that are currently underserved by the insurance market due to the modest value of their homes or the exposure to natural catastrophes in their geographic area because these homeowners are underserved this portion of the market is typically subject to less pricing pressure from larger nationwide insurers that offer a more commoditized product we believe our underwriting expertise enables us to compete effectively in these markets by evaluating and appropriately pricing risk in addition we believe our willingness to meet these underserved segments of the personal lines insurance market fosters deeper relationships with and increased loyalty from the agents who distribute our products our target personal lines customer has an average account size of  in premium overall we seek a balance of our premiums earned between commercial and personal lines to better diversify our business and mitigate the potential cyclical nature of either market in serving these markets we write business on both an admitted and excess  surplus es basis insurance companies writing on an admitted basis are licensed by the states in which they sell policies and are required to offer policies using premium rates and forms that are typically filed with state insurance regulators nonadmitted carriers writing in the es market are not bound by most of the rate and form regulations imposed on standard market companies allowing them the flexibility to change the coverage offered and the rate charged without the time constraints and financial costs associated with the filing process our corporate structure allows us to offer both admitted and es products in select markets through either conifer insurance company cic or white pine insurance company wpic our experience with specialty insurance products enables us to react to new market opportunities and underwrite multiple specialty lines while we will pursue top line premium growth we do not do so at the expense of losing underwriting discipline our underwriters have the experience and institutional flexibility to recognize when to exit certain products in favor of more profitable opportunities as insurance market conditions dictate  we were incorporated in october  as conifer
