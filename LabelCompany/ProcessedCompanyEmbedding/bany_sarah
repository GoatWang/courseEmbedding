baby alive super snacks snackin sara blond  customer review by mrblueu  stars  by mrblueu by mrblueu top  contributor spark reviewer  received free product so cute and so much fun this toy is also educational in my opinion as it teaches children a little bit about caring for a child baby alive can speak in two languages english and spanish plus her mouth moves when she talksreally cute she can say  phrases the doll has a nonremovable bracelet in which you squeeze her wrist to make her talkso easy and convenient she comes with reusable doll food and children can even make the food by using the included molds and roller baby alive comes with two diapersand yes when fed baby alive will make use of the diaper ha additionally she even comes with her own plate and container of juice with strawno liquid only for pretend and when the straw is inserted in her mouth it looks as if she is really drinking her eyes are do not move she has a pretty pink dress on with pink bloomers underneath baby alive does require  double aa alkaline batteries demo batteries are included this doll is for ages  years of age this toy is by hasbro and additional accessories may be purchased separately

meinkentucky by meinkentucky top  contributor spark reviewer  received free product i have the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde she comes with  aa demo batteries  diapers  small packages of a soft puttylike dough in green and orange a plastic tool to use as a rolling pin and  cookie cutter type utensils to cut out her play food in shapes like carrots and apple slices a pretend juice box with pretend straw and the cute outfit she is wearing there is a built in pink bracelet on her left wrist if you squeeze the bracelet she says cute things like asking her new mommy if its snack time sara his the harder body style doll she has joints at the shoulder and hips to move arms and legs slightly her mouth moves when she speaks and also moves when she chews her food or sips her juice when fed her reusable putty food it goes in her mouth and drops thru a passage from her throat to her diaper to be reused  her eyes do not close when you lay her down for a nap as little girls do but they are pretty eyes you can hear the mechanical sounds when she talks but the cuteness factor over rides it the suggested age is  years and up i noticed on walmartcom that other food shape tools and putty colors are available for purchase at this time all in all nice interactive doll for the little girl in your life was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have

reviewer  received free product adorable doll  customer review by kesa  stars  by kesa by kesa top  contributor spark reviewer  received free product my daughters birthday is coming up and i decided to let my daughter open this today as soon as it arrived my first thoughts were how cute the doll is and how much fun she will have with the doll this doll is made to eat the doll food and then eliminate it into the diapers provided her mouth moves while talking this doll comes with ten accessories a plate pretend juice box rolling pin two diapers two one ounce containers of reusable doll food three shaping tools and instructions on how to clean the pretend food out of the doll she knows thirty or more phrases and can speak english or spanish you can press the bracelet on the dolls wrist to make her talk she can tell you when she is hungry when she wants you to make snacks her diaper is full and when she is sleepy one thing i think should be fixed is the amount of pressure you have to use to squeeze the wrist bracelet in order for it to talk a small child might have trouble getting the doll to talk if they cant squeeze the bracelet with enough force the box says it is for children ages  months and up i think this will make a wonderful christmas present or birthday gift for any little girl they can have so much fun with this it requires  aa batteries which is included

reviewer  received free product im doing a review of the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde i love this doll i wish i had this when i was young it really acts like a live baby she tells you when she is hungry she tells you when it is time to play and says i love you she says thirty different phrases they are also loud enough to hear but not too loud you can set her to speak in spanish or english i think that is cool that they do that too she comes with two diapers and one pair of clothes she comes with three different shaped plastic tools i think they are used to feed her with or just for play im not sure one is a green apple one is an orange carrot and the other one is pink but im not sure what it is suppose to be she comes with two containers of food the play food must be put back into the container to keep it soft one is orange i guess to represent carrots the other one is green maybe it is to represent peas i dont know for sure it is just what i think it is like play dough it is softer and cooler feeling than clay that is the only way to explain it she comes with a roller to roll the food out into small shapes when you feed her the food she acts like she is eating it her mouth moves also if you stick your finger in her mouth she says a sound to mean no i cant spell out the sound she also comes with a yellow plate and a pretend juice box you can put it in her mouth and she looks like she is drinking it her mouth moves when she is talking but is not moving per syllable it just moves okay now to talk about the food when you feed her the food it goes into the back of her throat or it comes out goes to into her diaper there is a straight hole going through her from her throat to her bottom and it just falls out some of the food also can stay in her throat if it does there is a compartment that you can unscrew in the back of her neck to open it you can get the food out that way like i said this is a really cool doll any girl would love this doll my granddaughter certainly does i recommend this doll to every girl was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was this review helpful

review by dindin  stars  by dindin by dindin top  contributor spark reviewer  received free product my two year old has had this baby sara for a little over a week and she loves it so much shes so amused that she eats and drinks she takes her baby with her everywhere she goes even to daycare its a must i thinks sara is the cutest with her big eyes slightly big head shes just so adorable and i love the fact she speaks english and spanish since my children are hispanic thats a plus for me also she’s bigger than any baby alive i’ve seen in stores sara does quite a bit she talks so many phrases responds eats the bottle is solid plastic no liquid and is pretend so lo liquids  no mess  no need for new diapers my next step is to get my baby girl a stroller for her favorite doll baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll comes with an outfit two diapers for changing  ounce containers of her own food  shaping tools a roller plate and juice box the food is similar to playdoh and the baby will need changing after she eats just like a real infant unlike a real infant however sara will tell her caretaker that shes hungry for a snack or needs to be changed the only thing i really dont are for is that her mouth stays open highly recommend this doll was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was this review helpful

sara  customer review by bethaniaz  stars  by bethaniaz by bethaniaz spark reviewer  received free product my daughter loves this doll she has a baby alive doll that i bought her a couple years ago but shes been asking for one that actually goes potty so when she saw the doll she was thrilled as a parent i love that the doll speaks english and spanish im puerto rican but my daughter doesnt know much spanish so this is a good start the doll is so easy to understand so thats awesome i love that the doll includes  accessories my daughter has fun making her baby foodit comes with  small containers of reusable food in the colors green and orangeit feels a lot like playdoh so its easy to work with and use the shape cutter to make the fruits and vegetables to feed the baby a fake juice box is also included you turn her on by pushing her wrist and she says a lot of things  phrases i havent heard them all because my daughter usually takes off with the doll and thats fine because im sure id get annoyed from hearing her the doll also includes  changes of diapers that can be used over and over since the doll doesnt wet the only thing i didnt like is that the food would sometimes stick in her mouth and also sometimes when changing the diaper the playdoh falls out onto the carpet but thats something that can be resolved quick i just have my daughter lay the doll on a small blanket when she changes her this doll is cute and will keep your kids occupied for hours it was a hit with my nieces as well and i love that there are  different dolls a blond  a brunette and an african american doll so i will be buying them one and they can all have a different one was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was

ginwithaj  stars  by ginwithaj by ginwithaj spark reviewer  received free product the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde is really cute she has big blue green eyes blonde hair and a cute citrus print dress so even just as a plain baby doll she is appealing my  year old daughter loves to play mama because she sees me with her little brothers this doll gives her the chance to really feed and change her baby just like mama the doll comes with two jars of food which is play dough the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde can tell her when she is hungry so my daughter can make her food and feed her the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde also can tell my daughter when she needs to be changed ew but my daughter loves it and the doll can tell her when she is sleepy so my daughter gets to play mama in  ways the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde can also be given pretend juice it comes with diapers but i can already see that ill need to buy more im not sure if they sell them separately but if not a preemie diaper may fit and be just a teeny bit big cleaning the play dough out is not my favorite job but its not horrible its worth it bc my little girl loves to feed her so much overall i think that this is a neat doll and is recommend it to a little girl or boy who is interested in parenting role play was this review helpful yes  no

contributor spark reviewer  received free product i just received the blond baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll in the mail and my six year old daughter loves her she has been playing with her ever since we opened the box this doll comes with  diapers a juice box one shirt a pair of shorts  “baby alive solid doll food” containers  cookie cutters in different food shapes a rolling pin which i forgot to put in the pictures i posted and a plate you can make food pieces out of the “baby alive solid doll food” which is pretty much a type of play dough and you feed them to the baby once you put the food in her mouth she eats it after a couple of pieces the food is in her diaper and she is ready to be changed one of the biggest problems with this doll i have is the fact that she doesn’t sit upright by herself very well my daughter kept trying to sit the doll up but the doll kept falling over my daughter eventually had to sit her up in a baby stroller she already had the second problem i have with this doll is that the diaper seems a little small for the doll i laid the doll down and had to maneuver the diaper a bit to make sure it stayed on my sixyearold daughter kept having trouble putting it on i wish the diaper straps were made of velcro or something else other than tape i can see the straps not lasting after many opens and closes this doll has a lot of different phrases she says when you push her bracelet there two different languages that the doll can speak in english and spanish bottom line… cute doll but could use a few fixes to make it better

expecting twins in november so i thought this would be a perfect surprise for her saras skin feels soft to the touch she is well structured and i can tell will be a toy that will last and be passed down to the twins the sara doll is dressed in a very wellmade cute flowered dressher legs and arms can be posed and swivel where connected to the body there is a switch at the base of her head that turns her offon sara speaks both english or spanish sara tells you when she is sleepy hungry thirsty and when she needs to be changed sara speaks  plus phrases her voice is so girlie cute a small negative is that her eyes are painted on so they do not open and close the only negative i have to say about this doll is her hair up front she has cute pony tails and all looks cute and full in the back though was a different story the hair was so sparse you can see the the lack of hair and wider spacing but being a resourceful grandparent i took the loose hair from the front and put in a ponytail in back instant fix my granddaughter was so thrilled when she received this her eyes were the size of saucers just like the doll saras she pressed out the dough food and started making the food shapes then when sara was hungry she fed her with the spoon the food goes down her throat and then she needs to be changed because she pooped the food is reusablehow much fun my granddaughter had feeding and changing the baby when sara is thirsty you can feed her with her bottle i think a good feature is that the bottle is solid plastic this means no liquidno mess which means no need to purchase new diapers every time she wets all and all this is a wonderful gift for your little girl  and up my granddaughter tells me she is practicing change diapers and feeding her baby so she can help her mommy when the twins come how cute is that she has only had this doll for a few days but her mom tells me she doesnt go anywhere without it this is a wonderful purchase for little girlsi also appreciated that the accessories more diapers food etc are available online if you need them the play food is wheat based so if there is allergy problem with gluten there are plenty of recipes to make the food on the web was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was this review helpful yes  no  too palm springs ca would recommend to

 received free product i got the baby alive doll for free to try and leave my own personal opinions on this doll is more of a pain than it is fun first of all you feed the doll playdough i am a mom to a  and  yr old and playdoh is annoying its hit or miss if the doll actually eats the playdoh or if it gets stuck then you have to fight trying to get it out the diapers are cheap and the tabs lost their stickyness after the first couple days i went to replace the diapers and theyre expensive to replace i am also not sure how i feel about what the doll is teaching kids by feeding it then getting it out of the diaper after she poops it out then to feed it to her again i feel like it would send the wrong message to kids overall i would not reccomend this doll just for the facts of the playdoh and the diapers and the message it sends kids was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was this review helpful yes  no  stk would

valzem spark reviewer  received free product this is blonde baby sara super snacks snackin from the baby alive collection of somewhat lifelike dolls designed for little girls to take care of their own little babies this doll is rather large has painted eyes and its mouth is open because its designed to be fed as well as talk the talking is a very cool feature because she will speak in english or spanish included with the doll is her outfit of course two containers of doll food which resembles play doh oz each and they are reusable also included is two diapers shaping tools a roller plate and a juice box as well as instructions baby sara eats but does not drink also there is replacement items available id check online and at the store if you are wanting or needing any our little two year old niece absolutely loves her but there are some parental drawbacks sometimes the food gets caught and is kind of hard to get out of her mouth and food or poo from the diaper can get on the floor and it can get messy other than that this doll is so much fun for her she loves to feed her and even though the saras eyes do not close she loves to put her to bed and sing to her very cute there are some things im not too crazy about but there are positives too that override my thoughts i would recommend but also be aware there may be some aggravation for the parents was this review helpful yes  no

genderfemale received free productyes spark reviewer  received free product hmmm  customer review by ibell  stars  by ibell by ibell top  contributor spark reviewer  received free product well its a cute baby my daughters are   they want a baby sister i told them i cant be feeding and changing diapers anymore they said they would do it so i got them this doll to see how well they would do the package says it is suitable for toddlers its really not hear is why first of all the clay food has to be flattened and cut for feeding some kids can do it my  year old had trouble with it because she either squashed it too thin or not thin enough also the diapers are the old school diapers with the sticky tab remember those if you did it wrong you had to get the tape out same thing here i did show them how the sticky part had to stay on the clear plastic and be closed up during changings but it still lost the stickiness pretty fast not nice to have a sagging diaper also the pants are way too tight we had trouble removing the pants without the diaper and putting them on with the diaper was a very big hassle even for me my girls all love the baby even with the issues but dont play with her that much because it gets boring the doll recognizes when you try feeding her and she doesnt want any the doll can recognize the difference between juice and food aside from that the phrases are on a repeating loop it will say she is hungry and will jump to the next phrase while they are still trying to cut the food up or she wont wait for them to finish changing the diaper before shes asking for more food its a loop and my girls think it gets boring finally they all had an issue with the doll eating her own poop yeah you feed the food it just falls straight onto the diaper through a large cavity that runs from the throat to the diaper when you change the diaper you are suppose to get the poop and put it back on the food cup explain that to a toddler my girls are older and after a few hours of ewe they got used to it i would recommend this doll but not to children who have yet to master potty training was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully

free product love baby alive  customer review by mrswin  stars  by mrswin by mrswin spark reviewer  received free product i have been a fan of baby alive since i was young and i am glad i can now share her with my own daughter the super snack snackin’ sara doll is very cute and it is actually bigger than i thought it looked online which is great this doll is the perfect gift for that little girl in your life that likes to play mommy my daughter is still a little young to fully enjoy all the features of the doll like changing her diaper but she does like playing with the doll itself she also likes the fact that it talks and it tells when it’s hungry and when it’s ready for naptime i think i have given my niece a different baby alive doll as a gift for the past three christmases and she loves them this one would definitely make a great gift for this christmas the doll eats and comes with reusable “food” and cookie cutter type things to cut out the “food” into different food shapes then the “food” comes out in the diaper and it can then be stored in the little containers to be reused she also comes with a little juice box great doll we love it was this review helpful yes

reviewer  received free product this doll is a “no” for me  customer review by nomorenamesleft  stars  by nomorenamesleft by nomorenamesleft top  contributor spark reviewer  received free product this doll is a “no” for me the concept or idea is amazing i love the thought of feeding the baby and this then combines the fun of playdoh type material like clay with doll play and the juice box is cute too the details put on the doll see my photo of sara dolly’s little bracelet on her wrist are modern and cute not entirely sure about her mouth shape but the food “fits” however the “food” for sara dolly the playdoh can’t be used by the age listed for the doll the age listed is eighteen months and up i would never ever trust an eighteen month old child with playdoh anywhere but right at the table with my help and assistance my carpets my child’s hair etc i am also really concerned that the clay or playdoh will get “gummed up” in the sara dolly’s belly i am guessing it will dry out and still “come out” but too much might just clog everything up further the diapers are expensive but very cheap material if this doll is something you really want to try teach your child about cloth diapers eco friendly yay the doll is an overall “no” for me was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was this review helpful yes  no

great learning device  customer review by buyerfromhere  stars  by buyerfromhere by buyerfromhere spark reviewer  received free product so this doll it pretty neat it will provide hours and hours of fun for any child not only is it a toy any girl will love but it is also a great learning device for young children learning to potty train or any older child learning the responsibilities of taking care of a baby you feed it the food it comes with and it swallows it then it shows up in the diaper and then the doll tells you it needs changed that gives the child a very real simulation of what happens when you feed a baby and what needs to be done to clean it up it comes with two diapers to reuse over and over this doll has many things it says and also speaks spanish it comes with a juice box two diapers a roller for the dough  food cutters and a plate to serve the food on you squeeze the bracelet to make her talk i recommend this to any parent looking for a fun educational toy for

stars  by felipa by felipa spark reviewer  received free product the baby alive super snacks snackin sara doll blonde is just about the cutest toy doll i have ever seen when my  year old daughter held her for the first time she was ecstatic with joy she promptly named her doll lucinda and said im a mommy my  year old son is quite enthralled with the doll as well he asked his sister to show him how to feed and change the diapers and then he declared im a good daddy a toy that can help my son develop good character traits such as caring for others empathy and responsibility is a toy i can get behind the food is similar to playdough consistency it goes right down the dolls mouth chute and out the bottom it will fill the diaper and the doll will tell you she needs to be changedso darling her mouth actually opens and closes with motorized action and a pretend juice box can be held up to her like a bottle when she is not feeding the diapers are rather poorly made i will probably go buy some real diapers if i can find preemie sized ones to replace the two that come with the doll a little diaper bag to hold all of the dolls items would also have been a nice addition to the set i gave my daughter a little plastic bag with a zipper closure to hold all of the items so she can take her baby anywhere and everywhere this doll is far superior to my old baby alive from  years ago this doll actually talks to her mommy and is very wellbehaved or so says my daughter there is even a switch on the doll that allows it to speak in spanish was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you

received free product my  ½ year old daughter loves little baby alive super snacks snackin’ sara the doll is pretty solid and big but that doesn’t stop my daughter from carrying her around the house and giving her lots of hugs the doll says quite a few things and my daughter is thrilled to have a baby doll that speaks to her and tells her what she needs little baby alive tells my daughter that she is thirsty and my daughter is ready with her juice when the baby says she is hungry you can feed her the reusable food think play doh she actually can ‘eat’ it and then needs a diaper changing play doh falls out below the diaper and pants are a little hard to put on for a  ½ year old but she is catching on the only thing that really is difficult is even though the doll is posable she doesn’t sit up on her own since my daughter plays mostly on the ground with her i showed her how to prop the doll up against the wall or against her kitchen set if you have a play stroller or high chair it would work great with this doll my daughter loves playing mommy with this doll and i believe this would be a great christmas gift idea for a  to  year old was this review helpful yes  no

alive super snacks snackin’ sara blonde is really cute it is rated for  years of age and i think it is appropriate as taking care of this doll requires a little responsibility the doll comes with “doll food” that resembles playdoh as well as tools to make the food into all kind of healthy snack choices since the doll also expels the food included are two reusable diapers the only think i am not a big fan of is the fact that the doll’s mouth stay open in default position because of the food’s consistency it is important to teach your child where they can prepare it as well as a proper place to change the diapers i suggest a designated blanketchanging station in an area without carpets children have a tendency to drop things and playdoh has tendency to ruin carpets so i recommend separating the two the doll talks if you squeeze her wrist but you do have to use some pressure and it is possible that not all  yearolds would be able to push it hard enough the doll will ask for a snack and to be changed i think it is a great tool to use when you are preparing a child for a pet and trying to teach him or her about responsibilities of feeding and cleaning after one was this
