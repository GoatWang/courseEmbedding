soul afp  friday july   twenty years ago stylist gianni versace was gunned down in miami plunging his fashion house into crisis two decades on it is one of the worlds top global luxury brands thanks to his little sister donatella he had gone out for the morning papers as versace returned to his miami beach mansion on july   he was shot dead by andrew cunanan a homosexual prostitute known for his obsession with all things luxury the fashion world mourned deeply the stylist to celebrities from madonna to elton john had been just  years old he was a degrees creator a real artist he had a pure creative vision on colours and materials stefania saviolo director of the luxury and fashion centre at bocconi university told afp in milan the group he had created with his brother santo in  had been one of the hottest fashion brands in the world it fell to versaces platinum blonde sister donatella  to whom gianni had entrusted the casual line versus  to take over as artistic director but the brand struggled to recover from versaces murder donatella who had worked for  years alongside gianni was severely affected by the loss of her brother and confessed to feeling vulnerable depression and cocaine you cant invent yourself as an artistic director overnight says saviolo particularly as donatella took over at a time when fashion was changing a lot with many collections and great pressure on artistic directors donatella instantly recognisable for her famous locks and perpetual tan sank into a period of depression and cocaine use before detoxifying in  the year before the brand had acquired a new ceo in giancarlo di risio the former fendi boss refocused the medusa on the luxury market streamlining licensing and franchising deals and developing the accessories range amid rumours in the press of a fallout between the family and di risio over planned cuts he was replaced in  by gian giacomo ferraris who moved over from the jil sander fashion house ferraris wasted no time in launching an extensive reorganisation plan to return versace to profitability cutting  percent of its workforce and closing some boutiques before opening new ones as the books improved his intervention doubled the turnover which rose from  million euros in  to  million in  according to david pambianco who heads up a consultancy company in his name by  the historic brand had returned to profit after a gruelling three years of losses so much potential the right balance was struck between ferraris and donatella the dialogue between them was good and there was great respect for donatellas creativity and vision saviolo said the family which had always refused to relinquish control to a luxury conglomerate like so many of its fellow italian fashion houses finally yielded a  percent stake in  to the us private equity firm blackstone the move which donatella said would allow versace to achieve its potential resulted in a cash injection into the luxury designer and boosted its presence in emerging markets the bet paid off despite a difficult global context sales increased by some  percent in  and in  the house said it was time to move onto the next phase and ferraris was replaced in may  by jonathan akeroyd former ceo of alexander mcqueen results last year were mixed with sales up  percent to  million euros but the company admitting a loss of  million euros due in particular to funds sunk into its network of boutiques these results have caused some uncertainty but the company is healthy certainly more than  years ago said pambianco versace remains one of the most beautiful brands in the world in the luxury sector and has still so much potential to express he said pointing out that luxury house gucci for example has a turnover that is seven times higher
