nature these specialists work in the emergency room er departments of hospitals where they oversee cases involving cardiac distress trauma fractures lacerations and other acute conditions emergency physicians are specially trained to make urgent lifesaving decisions to treat patients during an emergency medical crisis these doctors diagnose and stabilize patients before they are either well enough to be discharged or transferred to the appropriate department for longterm care internal medicine an internist is a physician who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of conditions that affect the adult population—both acute and chronic these doctors are often who adults see as their primary physicians because they treat a broad range of illnesses that do not require surgical or specialist interventions they also work to help a patient maintain optimal health in order to prevent the onset of disease in addition to treating the common cold and flu internists also treat chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease family medicine a family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages at all stages of life rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments like cold and flu or respiratory infections and health screenings when necessary family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist the doctors may also provide physicals inoculations prenatal care treat chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma and provide advice on disease prevention specialties emergency medicineinternal medicinefamily medicine schools state university of new york upstate medical

flnorthwest medical center on staff margate flbaptist hospital of miami inc miami flcolumbia hospital west palm beach fl information about group practices what is a group practice according to the medical group management association a group practice is any relationship between three or more physicians who share facilities expenses profits and other resources like support staff and equipment group practices tend to fall into two categories those that organize around a particular medical specialty and those that encompass several specialties like east boston neighborhood health that specializes in internal medicine why group practice as medicine became more complex in the twentieth century the need for group practices made more sense physicians found it impossible to know everything about the emerging drugs and technologies on the medical landscape in addition the cost of providing a full range of diagnostic services such as tests and xrays in one location became prohibitive to the individual practitioner hence doctors from various disciplines began to team together in order to provide more comprehensive care to their community of patients benefits of group practice access to doctors from various disciplines for referrals and advice better coverage on weekends and offhours onestop clinics for comprehensive care and testing advertisement home  group
