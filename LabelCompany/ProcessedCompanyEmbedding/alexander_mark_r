to inherit the bulk of his fathers herbalife fortune but in the meantime his mother and the estates trustees are in a bitter fightseptember  robert w welkos  times staff writer his name is alex he is  years old and when he reaches  he stands to inherit an estate now valued at about  millionthis la golden child is the only son of mark hughes the late founder of herbalife international a maker of nutritional supplementshughes death at age  on may   made alex the sole beneficiary of a vast trust the multimillionaire died of a lethal combination of alcohol and an antidepressant after a drinking binge the death was deemed accidentalbut alexander reynolds hughes is now at the center of a lengthy and contentious probate battle in los angeles county superior court pitting his mother suzan hughes a former actress court reporter and miss petite usa against trustees of the hughes family trust mark and suzan hughes divorced two years before his death in  after nearly a decade of marriage she was the third of his four wivessuzan hughes wants the court to oust the trustees who include alexs paternal grandfather she previously tried  and failed  to persuade the courts to remove the trustees on grounds of violating their fiduciary duties now she has filed another petition seeking their removal on other groundshillel chodos her attorney claims the trustees have paid themselves millions in fees while ignoring alexs needsbasically they got the gold mine and alex got the shaft chodos said they have paid themselves at least  million in trustee fees to date  maybe more they paid their lawyers and accountants maybe  million to  millionbut attorneys for the trust have fired back in court papers accusing suzan hughes of waging a personal vendetta against the administrators of the hughes trust they describe the case as one of the most contentious trust and estate proceedings on recordand this they point out comes even though the trustees have achieved enormous success in administering the nearly million estate mark left behind eg  they saved more than  million in estate taxes they structured a sale of marks company for a price that was approximately twice the market price immediately before his death and they successfully opposed nearly  million in claimswhile suzan complains loudly over the legal fees incurred by the fiduciaries the plain facts show her to be the root cause of the expenses the court papers state the fiduciaries submit that a review of the history of these matters leads to the conclusion that the administration has not been complicated by any fault of theirs but instead by suzan hughes desire to gain access to the money mark left for alex and not for herthe trustees are doing their best to grow the assets said kenneth a ziskin an attorney for the trust if they are successful there will be way more than halfabillion dollars by the time alex reaches the trustees include alexs paternal grandfather jack reynolds former herbalife chief executive christopher pair who was a longtime friend of mark hughes and conrad lee klein an attorney who was mark hughes personal counsel for almost  years klein is the husband of california appeals court justice joan dempsey klein and served for many years as an executive officer of herbalife none of the parties including alex and his mother retained financial ties to herbalife after its saleunder terms of the trust alex will receive onethird of the trusts annual income  or about  million judging by todays value  along with an additional  million from a separate custodial account when he reaches age  at age  he could expect to receive about  million annually then at  he will receive whatever remains in the trust ziskin saidthats assuming they still have the money when he gets to be
