convertible and income fund nasdaqccd  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»calamos dynamic convertible and income fund setting up for a fallapr  about calamos dynamic ccd reuben gregg brewer dividend investing special situations contrarian reitssummaryccd is a new closedend fund offered by calamosits more focused on convertible securities than its siblingsbut it also trades at the highest premiumcalamos dynamic convertible and income fund nasdaqccd recently held its initial public offering at the moment its trading at a premium of around  thats well beyond the discounts most of its siblings change hands at investors should be prepared for a price decline happy birthday ccd ipoed on march th at a price of  per share the only thing is that ccd is a closedend fund which means that the  ipo price includes a sales commission the net asset value or nav at the time of the ipo was just  essentially anyone who bought at the ipo price overpaid by roughly  which is why investors should avoid closedend fund or cef ipos cef ipos are generally speaking sold product meaning that brokers push them to customers because people arent looking to buy on their own  and the brokers get compensated accordingly so far the nav has risen to  which is a good thing though buyers at  would still be under water if the price fell to the nav that said the market price has also increased going up to  meaning the current premium of  is actually higher than the premium when the cef ipoed and while right now anyone who bought at the ipo can feel reasonably good about the investment thats not likely to last for very long convertible specialist calamos is a convertible specialist and ccd is focused more heavily on convertibles than its sibling cefs in fact the goal is to have roughly  of its assets in convertible securities that can go as low as  depending on market conditions the rest is largely invested in highyield bonds thats a space in which most of the companys other cefs invest so calamos is well versed in that bond arena too the fund can also leverage up to a third of its assets though the expectation is that leverage will be under  for now its other funds tend to make sure of leverage as well essentially ccd invests in areas and ways in which calamos has plenty of experience the part that differentiates it from the other calamos offerings is the heavy focus on converts  the fund familys specialty that said ccd also has an interesting term limit provision according to calamos the term limit will allow shareholders to elect collectively whether or not to liquidate the fund on its th anniversary in  in theory that should allow the fund to track more closely to nav than other funds in reality however i wouldnt expect it to be a material price driver for another  years or so until that point ccd is just another closedend fund with a market price driven by investor supply and demand all in the family the thing is ccd is one of only two calamos cefs trading at a premium right now and the premium of sibling convertiblehigh income fund nasdaqchy is half that of ccd note that chys convertible exposure is roughly  with highyield bonds accounting for the vast majority of the nearly  of assets in traditional bonds it is probably the most similar product offering to ccd in the calamos family with that as a guide though why is ccd trading at twice the premium as an investor you shouldnt be surprised to see ccds premium narrow at least a few percentage points only a premium isnt the norm for chy according to the closedend fund association chy has traded at an average discount of around  over the past five years its traded at a slight discount on average over the trailing decade so while investors are paying more than nav for chy today that hasnt historically been the case so it isnt unreasonable to expect ccds premium to fall to nav or lower based on a comparison to chy although a stagnant market price and rising nav could accomplish that its more likely that the market price will decline toward nav using todays pricing trading at nav would mean a share price decline of around  that would leave those that invested in the ipo under water by a little over  but the story gets worse all of the other closedend funds in the calamos family trade at discounts reaching as high as  for calamos global dynamic income fund nasdaqchw chws fiveyear average discount is roughly  so  isnt an abnormally large discount to be fair global dynamic income fund is a very different animal than ccd with only about  of assets in convertibles the rest is largely stocks  of assets and high yield bonds about  so it probably isnt reasonable to expect ccd to fall to that wide of a discount at least not in the near term absent some noteworthy catalyst all downhill from here at the end of the day however ipo investors in ccd overpaid for the fund thats how cef ipos work although both the nav and market price have gone up since the ipo theres a pretty high likelihood that the premium wont remain as high as it is currently in fact its completely reasonable to expect the premium to go away entirely based on similar funds offered by the same family with little performance record to go on and a premium price its probably best that investors avoid ccd and if you bought at the ipo you might want to cash in now before its too late disclosure the
