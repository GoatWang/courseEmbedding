honcho daniel sundheim scoops up roone arledge’s old pad for m by kim velsey •  pm the original chinoiserie gracie wallpaper is still in the dining room it’s been quite the year for viking global investor cio daniel sundheim he stopped having to share his title with cocio tom purcell at viking which manages some  billion in assets and institutional investor finally named him to its rich list something else mr sundheim and wife brett won’t have to share anymore the th floor of  park avenue back in  the couple scooped up the old astor apartment at a huge discount down from an initial  million ask to a mere  million which comprised the entirety of the coop’s th floor but only some of the th floor we imagine that the sundheims must have felt the missing piece keenly after all who wouldn’t an eastern exposure not that it matters fortunately after only a few years of waiting the couple has closed on the nineroom apartment downstairs for  million according to city records this one also at a steep discount—the spread listed with kathy sloane at brown harris stevens had been asking  million since it hit the market last september but like the astor apartment the remainder of the th floor—nice as it sounds with a “wood paneled living room includes a wood burning fireplace and features three juliet balconies rare for park avenue and a special candela addition which welcome a nice breeze into the room”—was an estate sale the place was most recently occupied by the late tv executive roone arledge and his wife gisele who died in  and  respectively before the hotshot hedge funder moved in upstairs behold one of the juliet balconies for what it’s worth though the arledges had excellent taste and very gracious apartment they left up the original bird and floral chinoiserie gracie wallpaper in the dining room as we hope the sundheims follow their lead and reconfigured the four bedroom into three master bedrooms all with ensuite baths the easternfacing living room meanwhile opened to “a cozy library for entertaining or drinks a deux by the fire” which sounds just about ideal in cooler weather cognac anyone though nice as we’re sure the easternfacing living room is we expect the new owners are just grateful that they’ll never have to fret about which which way the windows face again now that they have four exposures on two floors see also the john oliver
