investment management in which buy and sell decisions are made by a portfolio manager or investment counselor for the clients account the term discretionary refers to the fact that investment decisions are made at the portfolio managers discretion this means that the client must have the utmost trust in the investment managers capabilities discretionary investment management can only be offered by individuals who have extensive experience in the investment industry and advanced educational credentials with many investment managers possessing the chartered financial analyst cfa designation discretionary investment management is generally only offered to high net worth clients who have a significant level of investable assets breaking down discretionary investment management discretionary investment management offers a number of benefits to clients it frees them from the burden of making daytoday investment decisions which can arguably be better made by a qualified portfolio manager who is attuned to the vagaries of the market delegating the investing process to a competent manager leaves the client free to focus on other things that matter to him or her discretionary investment management also aligns the investment managers interest with that of the client since managers typically charge a percentage of the assets under administration as their management fee thus if the portfolio grows under the investment managers stewardship the manager is compensated by receiving a higher dollar amount as the management fee this reduces the advisers temptation to churn the account in order to generate more commissions which is a major flaw of a transactionbased investment model discretionary investment management may also ensure that the client has access to better investment opportunities through the portfolio manager the client may also receive better prices for executed trades as the portfolio manager can put through a single buy or sell order for multiple clients from the clients point of view he or she must have confidence in the portfolio managers competence integrity and trustworthiness it is therefore incumbent upon clients to conduct adequate due diligence on potential portfolio managers before entrusting them with their life savings trading center money manager discretionary account investment management investment

vigilant the outlook is for increasing rates in  due to improved economic activity and inflation pressures tactical positions high yield struggled somewhat in the first quarter of  due to slightly widening credit spreads during  high yield bonds exhibited great performance as credit spreads tightened dramatically following the energy scare of february  however high coupon yields in this sector provide attractive income in a low rate environment we view high yield to be fully valued and will use it as source of funds to bolster other positions we continue to overweight credit versus treasuries with duration tilted shorter than benchmarks emerging market debt denominated in us dollars provides diversification and yield potential stability in global growth will further entice yield investors to add to these positions commercial real estate continues to provide positive returns queues can delay additions to positions and an increase in interest rates could dampen valuation improvements value added or opportunistic strategies can be a complement to a core real estate exposure strategic outlook  equities the domestic large cap stock market appears to be fully valued and has priced in an anticipated earnings rebound the negative impacts on earnings of a strong dollar and energy price rebound will fade in   the yearoveryear comparisons will become easier tactical positions small cap stocks are over weighted versus targets in portfolios small cap stocks while more inherently volatile will benefit from fiscal stimulus also small cap stocks are relatively undervalued to large cap stocks international stocks are equally weighted versus targets the quantitative easing programs in europe and japan should provide tailwinds to stocks the relative dollar weakening in the quarter added to returns on foreign stocks emerging markets stocks are over weighted versus targets as they are comparatively attractive due to their low relative pe multiples asian
