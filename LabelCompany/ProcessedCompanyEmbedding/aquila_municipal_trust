portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance� during the fiscal year ended march   the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies under normal circumstances at least  of the funds net assets will be invested in municipal obligations that pay interest exempt in the opinion of bond counsel from kentucky income and regular federal income taxes the income paid upon which will not be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax on individuals� in general almost all of these obligations are issued by the commonwealth of kentucky its counties and various other local authorities these obligations may also include certain other governmental issuers such as american samoa guam the northern mariana islands puerto rico and the virgin islands� we call these kentucky obligations these securities may include participation or other interests in municipal securities and variable rate demand notes� a significant portion of the kentucky obligations in which the fund invests consist of revenue bonds which are backed only by revenues from certain facilities or other sources and not by the issuer itself� these obligations can be of any maturity but the funds average portfolio maturity has traditionally been between  and  years at the time of purchase the funds kentucky obligations must be of investment grade quality this means that they must either  be rated within the four highest credit ratings assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or  if unrated be determined to be of comparable quality by the funds manager aquila investment management llc the manager selects obligations for the funds portfolio in order to best achieve the funds objective by considering various characteristics including quality maturity and coupon rate principal risks you may lose money by investing in the fund� following is a summary description of certain risks of investing in the fund market risk the market prices of the funds securities may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to general market conditions such as real or perceived adverse economic political or regulatory conditions inflation changes in interest rates lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse investor sentiment� when market prices fall the value of your investment will go down� in the past several years financial markets such as those in the united states europe asia and elsewhere have experienced increased volatility depressed valuations decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty� governmental and nongovernmental issuers have defaulted on or been forced to restructure their debts� these conditions may continue recur worsen or spread� the us government and the federal reserve as well as certain foreign governments and their central banks have taken steps to support financial markets including by keeping interest rates at historically low levels� this and other government intervention may not work as intended particularly if the efforts are perceived by investors as unlikely to achieve the desired results� the federal reserve has reduced its market support activities and recently has begun raising interest rates� certain foreign governments and central banks are implementing or discussing socalled negative interest rates eg charging depositors who keep their cash at a bank to spur economic growth� further federal reserve or other us or nonus governmental or central bank actions including interest rate increases or contrary actions by different governments could negatively affect financial markets generally increase market volatility and reduce the value and liquidity of securities in which the fund invests interest rate risk� the value of your investment will generally go down when interest rates rise a rise in rates tends to have a greater impact on the prices of longer term or longer duration securities� interest rates in the us have been historically low so the fund faces a heightened risk that interest rates may rise� a general rise in interest rates may cause investors to move out of fixed income securities on a large scale which could adversely affect the price and liquidity of fixed income securities and could also result in increased redemptions from the fund� the maturity of a security may be significantly longer than its effective duration� a securitys maturity may be more relevant than its effective duration in determining the securitys sensitivity to other factors such as changes in credit quality or in the yield premium that the market may establish for certain types of securities credit risk if an issuer or obligor of a security held by the fund or a counterparty to a financial contract with the fund defaults or is downgraded or is perceived to be less creditworthy or if the value of the assets underlying a security declines the value of your investment will typically decline� securities in the lowest category of investment grade ie bbbbaa may be considered to have speculative characteristics rating agency risk investment grade debt securities may be downgraded by a major rating agency to below investment grade status which would increase the risk of holding these securities in addition a rating may become stale in that it fails to reflect changes to an issuers financial condition ratings represent the rating agencys opinion regarding the quality of the security and are not a guarantee of quality in addition rating agencies are subject to an inherent conflict of interest because they are often compensated by the same issuers whose securities they grade risks associated with investments in kentucky and other municipal obligations the fund may be affected significantly by adverse economic political or other events affecting kentucky and other municipal issuers in which the fund may invest� continued economic recovery in kentucky will be affected by among other factors employment growth and energy production including the market for kentucky coal as well as by uncertainty related to federal fiscal policy slower growth in the global economy geopolitical risks and business and consumer uncertainty related to these issues� continued losses in miningrelated jobs is an ongoing concern� federal policies may significantly reduce the demand for kentucky coal� municipal issuers may be adversely affected by rising health care costs increasing unfunded pension liabilities and by the phasing out of federal programs providing financial support� kentuckys retirement systems are underfunded by about  with a total unfunded pension liability of approximately  billion� unfavorable conditions and developments relating to projects financed with municipal securities can result in lower revenues to issuers of municipal securities potentially resulting in defaults� issuers often depend on revenues from these projects to make principal and interest payments� the value of municipal securities also can be adversely affected by changes in the financial condition of one or more individual municipal issuers or insurers of municipal issuers regulatory and political developments tax law changes or other legislative actions and by uncertainties and public perceptions concerning these and other factors� in recent periods an increasing number of municipal issuers have defaulted on obligations been downgraded or commenced insolvency proceedings financial difficulties of municipal issuers may continue or get worse  aquila churchill taxfree fund of kentucky tax risk the income on the funds kentucky obligations and other municipal obligations could become subject to federal andor state income taxes due to noncompliant conduct by issuers unfavorable legislation or litigation or adverse interpretations by regulatory authorities liquidity risk the fund may make investments that are illiquid or become illiquid after purchase� illiquid assets may also be difficult to value if the fund is forced to sell an illiquid security to meet redemption requests or other cash needs the fund may be forced to sell the security at a loss� the fund may not receive its proceeds from the sale of certain securities for an extended period for example several weeks or even longer� in extreme cases this may constrain the funds ability to meet its obligations including obligations to redeeming shareholders prepayment or call risk many issuers have a right to prepay their securities� issuers may be more likely to prepay their securities if interest rates fall� if this happens the fund will not benefit from the rise in the market price of the securities that normally accompanies a decline in interest rates and will be forced to reinvest prepayment proceeds at a time when yields on securities available in the market are lower than the yield on prepaid securities the fund may also lose any premium it paid on prepaid securities extension risk� if interest rates rise repayments of fixed income securities may occur more slowly than anticipated by the market� this may drive the prices of these securities down because their interest rates are lower than the current interest rate and they remain outstanding longer portfolio selection risk the value of your investment may decrease if the managers judgment about the quality relative yield value or market trends affecting a particular security industry sector or region or about interest rates is incorrect valuation risk� the sales price the fund could receive for any particular portfolio investment may differ from the funds valuation of the investment particularly for securities that trade in thin or volatile markets or that are valued using a fair value methodology� investors who purchase or redeem fund shares on days when the fund is holding fairvalued securities may receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the fund had not fairvalued securities or had used a different valuation methodology� the funds ability to value its investments may be impacted by technological issues andor errors by pricing services or other third party service providers redemption risk� the fund may experience heavy redemptions that could cause the fund to liquidate its assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value which could cause the value of your investment to decline nondiversification risk� the fund is classified as a nondiversified investment company under the investment company act of  the  act thus compared with diversified funds it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in obligations of a small number of issuers in general the more the fund invests in the securities of specific issuers or issues of a similar project type the more the fund is exposed to risks associated with investments in those issuers or types of projects� also the fund may be more risky than a more geographically diverse fund these risks are discussed in more detail later in the prospectus or in the sai fund performance the following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund by showing changes in the funds performance from year to year and by showing how the funds average annual total returns for the designated periods compare with those of a

picks from fidelity� for no transaction fee alternatives summary overall rating  out of  stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar

overview objective the investment seeks as high a level of current income exempt from oregon state and regular federal income taxes as is consistent with preservation of capital strategy under normal circumstances at least  of the funds net assets will be invested in municipal obligations that pay interest exempt in the opinion of bond counsel from oregon state and regular federal income taxes the income paid upon which will not be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax on individuals these obligations can be of any maturity but the funds average portfolio maturity has traditionally been between  and  years the fund is nondiversified risk the municipal market can be affected by adverse tax legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities municipal funds carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities they also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible although statespecific municipal funds seek to provide interest dividends exempt from both federal and state income taxes and some of these funds may seek to generate income that is also exempt from federal alternative minimum tax outcomes cannot be guaranteed and the funds may generate some income subject to these taxes residency in the state is usually required for the state income tax exemption generally municipal securities are not appropriate for taxadvantaged accounts such as iras and ks additional risk information for this product may

average this fund scores below average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you
