and abuse potential  creative deal structure secures asset by resolving litigation and minimizes upfront cash  conference call today at  pm est  nov    et from depomed inc newark calif nov   prnewswire  depomed inc nasdaq depo today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the us and canadian rights to cebranopadol and its related followon compound from grünenthal gmbh grünenthal cebranopadol is a novel firstinclass analgesic in development for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain and is an important addition to depomeds leading portfolio in pain and neurology depomed anticipates advancing cebranopadol into phase iii development for chronic lower back pain clbp and other pain indications by  the deal adds a highly complementary development candidate with a strong efficacy profile favorable tolerability and low abuse potential with patent protection into the s to depomeds broad commercial platform of pain and neurology marketed products cebranopadol is a truly differentiated molecule with a novel dual mechanismofaction functioning as a highpotency agonist of both the muopioid and the nociceptin receptors cebranopadols pharmacology is likely to confer analgesic efficacy equivalent to that of traditional opioids in peripherallymediated nociceptive pain conditions while potentially conferring great efficacy in neuropathic pain and other pain states characterized by more centralized pain said srinivas rao md phd chief medical officer of depomed moreover the product does not appear to impact respiratory function to the degree that traditional muopioid receptor agonists do and the nociceptin receptor pharmacology also appears to substantially mitigate the abuse potential of cebranopadol continued dr rao these unique and beneficial properties along with a strong scientific rationale and a robust clinical package translate to a strong probability of success  making cebranopadol a great addition to our portfolio developmentally we have a welldefined pathway to follow that we believe has the potential to add tremendous value to both the chronic pain armamentarium and the company  the acquisition of this novel compound with its unique structure and characteristics fits perfectly with our longterm commitment to expanding our leading pain management portfolio said jim schoeneck president and chief executive officer of depomed this acquisition builds on depomeds leadership in pain our successful experience in drug development and further demonstrates our continued ability to do financially creative acquisitions with the goals of improving the lives of patients and increasing shareholder value under the terms of the agreement depomed has entered into a settlement agreement with endo pharmaceuticals inc a subsidiary of endo international plc endo to resolve depomeds ongoing patent litigation against endo for alleged infringement of three of depomeds patents by endos opana® er product  as the formulator of opana® er grünenthal indemnified endo for certain intellectual property matters including depomeds ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against endo the settlement agreement grants endo a nonexclusive patent license in the united states and a covenant not to sue outside the united states for the currently marketed form of opana® er in addition depomed is providing grünenthal with a limited covenant not to sue under certain depomed acuform® drug delivery patents with specific drug substances as well as  million in cash  depomed will also pay grünenthal royalties on net sales and onetime net sales milestones there are no clinical regulatory or approval milestone payments the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of  following termination or expiration of the waiting period under the hartscottrodino hsr antitrust improvements act of  and completion of other customary closing conditions the settlement agreement with endo becomes effective upon the closing under the license agreement to date cebranopadol has been studied in sixteen phase i four phase iia and three phase iib trials in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy pdpn osteoarthritis oa and chronic lower back pain as well as a human abuse potential study in total cebranopadol has been studied in approximately  patients worldwide  in summary these studies confirm a profile of high potency and efficacy with good tolerability and the potential for a lower abuse profile  depomed anticipates conducting an endofphaseii meeting with us food and drug administration fda in  and commencing phase iii development by  cebranopadol has patent protection through at least  with the potential for patent term extension to  cebranopadol is a firstinclass drug candidate due in large part to its unique ability to bind with high affinity to not only classical opioid receptors but also the nociceptin orphanin fq peptide or nop receptors which may offer improved management of some pain states with decreased side effects indeed nop agonists have been shown to have a broad range of effects and balanced agonist activity at the nop and mu receptors may result in an improved safety profile – reduced tolerance and reduced risk of respiratory depression versus mu agonist activity alone said frank porreca phd professor of pharmacology and anesthesiology the university of arizona college of medicine at tucson arising from grünenthal a leader in the development of multifunctional molecules cebranopadol has the potential to lead the way in novel analgesic therapy about cebranopadol cebranopadol is a novel firstinclass potent analgesic that has a dual mechanismofaction as an agonist of both the nociceptin receptor nop and the muopioid receptor mor these mechanisms which have been shown to synergize result in both a comparable efficacy and broader analgesic spectrum versus standard muopioid receptor agonists as well as an improved safety profile particularly as it pertains to dependence and respiratory depression cebranopadol has completed several phase ii trials in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy pdpn osteoarthritis oa and chronic lower back pain clbp and is ready for phase iii development baker botts llp represented depomed in the connection with this transaction conference call depomed will host a conference call
