sturdy latitude business laptops premium xps ultrabooks and alienware gaming rigs the highend machines did great in our reviews while most of the mainstream and budget systems were acceptable but unexciting dells tech support is mediocre but its excellent warranty covers shipping costs on all laptops when you need to send them in for service and it offers a slew of extension options dell’s key strengths xps the xps  and xps  are still as great as they’ve ever been with droolworthy infinityedge displays comfortable keyboards wonderful build quality and long battery life alienware arguably the best gaming laptops in the business alienware pushes the envelope with highend performance gorgeous designs and cuttingedge features like an oled display great warranty if you need to send in your laptop during the oneyear factory warranty period dell will cover the shipping costs in both directions dell’s main weaknesses forgettable lowend and business models no inspiron vostro or latitude earned a score higher than  or received an editor’s choice award mediocre tech support support reps didn’t know basic information about the companys preloaded software and kept us on hold for a long time toprated dell laptops dell xps   hours of battery life and beautiful screen dell xps   inches thick nvidia gtx  gpu alienware  k display options lots of ports optional graphics amp more the best dell laptops reviews  a trend emerged in dell’s reviews last year the company’s xps  xps  and alienware gaming notebooks are some of the best laptops on the market but most other products were unimpressive we reviewed  dell laptops five of which earned our editors’ choice nod two xps models and three alienware dell’s xps  in and a few select latitude notebooks earned  stars but dells vostro lineup was poor and both the latitude and inspiron series laptops were merely average design  dell continues its quest to oneup apple at every turn with minimalist aluminum designs in colors such as silver gold and rose gold like youll find on the dell xps  but dell gets its biggest wins with innovative designs like the xps  in which measures an incredibly slim  inches and features a barelythere infinityedge display midlevel laptops such as the inspiron   and the impractically large inspiron   in combine style and functionality dell isnt afraid to play with colors as evidenced by the bold hues of the inspiron   and the inspiron   the company also knows how to make a rather striking business notebook latitude   on the gaming front the alienware   and  have undergone some major design upgrades that yielded thinner lighter more sophisticated frames while retaining the intergalactic aesthetic that we know and love however outside of a few prominent redesigns many dell laptops are refreshes from two or threeyearold chassis support  dells website has plenty of tips howtos diagnostics and faqs to help you help yourself however when we called for phone support we often got phone agents who didnt know what our test laptop was capable of telling us that our xps  had no audio control software it does and that theres no builtin way to change the network priorities the preloaded killer network manager does just that innovation  the xps  in is the best example of dell’s innovative spirit this hybrid offers the same stunning bezelfree infinityedge display as the regular xps  but it can be used as a tablet too more important dell figured out a way to squeeze more power out of intel’s y series processor its dynamic power mode delivers more speed when you need it without requiring a fan in the design another true standout for the brand was the addition of an oled display to the alienware  providing the most colorful images we’ve ever seen from a gaming laptop value and selection  dell easily has the most diverse lineup of any laptop maker including strong entries in the mainstream consumer business and gaming markets its catalog includes supertough systems like its rugged extreme notebooks productivity powerhouses like the latitude  and affordable laptops like the pintsize inspiron   the companys alienware gaming laptops are always among the very best in the industry warranty  all dell laptops come with limited oneyear warranties and unlike some competitors the company covers all shipping costs if you need to send a product in for service upgrading your ram or storage drive does not void your warranty dell also gets points for offering a wide variety of extendedwarranty options which include increasing the length up to four or five years with onsite

th  at  am very informative post thanks to share this ninganagouda says september th  at  pm sir i am planned to purchase laptop from dell the online price is different and shop price is different which is the better way neverbuydellagain says august th  at  am do not buy dell if you travel abroad dell as most us based company do not give a st about worldwide service try you cannot even contact dell international only if you are a us citizen and you are located there too i purchased a in with  years of next business day warranty which day passed about  months ago the technical problem was taken care by the israeli dell representative so after ruining the laptop i have to organize the swap with them too meantime i travelled to belgium england and south africa too but i have to deal with the slightly retarded israeli techsupport and they have an issue understanding why i wont accept half the resolution ram and warranty compared to the one i paid for i had dell computers in the past but after  months to get my laptop or money back i get back to a different brand gave up on them i will spend my time blogging about this issue and raise awareness how bad this company is if any dell worker ever reads it here is an official swap dps  obxconsumer says august th  at  pm dell is a horrible company it is like ponzi scheme  they sell stuff and fight with you when it does not work and pay employees to put good ratings on the internet they are like the insurance companies that deny all claims until you literally have to get a lawyer and sue them mailing computers is stupid anyway because they get shaken up and thrown around it is time us citizens stood up for themselves and use their hard earned money to buy well made computers that actually last for years also the software and hardware changes all the time and we are supposed to buy new stuff constantly we are all going broke and filling the landfills i hate dell they ripped me off with a lemon i paid  dollars for and it has never worked for more than a few months at a time buyer beware they expect you to pay pay pay for warranties etc and the machines are designed to fail if you get one that actually works it was an accident the people in india never contact supervisors – they put the phone down and say the same thing – i just checked and i am sorry but there is nothing we can do – or they say they will submit the complaint and someone will call you and when they call back it is just the same person saying i just checked and i am sorry but there is nothing we can do debbie ohara says june rd  at  pm i have not been able to use my new  inch dell amd was ill a period after recieving barely on for a wk  the cursor disappeared read issues regarding this  called tech support barely understood  he was clearly not in the mode to help anyonehe knew what the prob was but said i would have to purchase the tech support package a huge monthly fee as well as yearly told him not for me erywans says may th  at  am soi like laptop computer dell 👍👍👍 the best dell thank you and so i love dell beeram surya chandra says may th  at  am i want to know the best dell laptop model mcarthurdw says may th  at  pm i have had a dell xps  model  laptop for les than a year i can honestly say that it is the biggest piece of crap i have ever owned the video driver crashes daily i have had tickets open with dell support on this issue from day one they have updated the video drivers and bios multiple times they replaced the ac adapter and a week ago they replaced the motherboard now this ten month old turd wont even power on dell is once again replacing the motherboard and the ac adapter as soon as i can get this piece of crap running again i am going to back up my data and sell it i will never own another dell product there computers are cheap rubbish bob greely says april th  at  pm what happened to dell i am in the middle of laptop hell trying to first get a laptop ordered then when it arrived it did not turn on then when i went to support they have my service tag id assigned to the wrong computer model so support will not help me i have had a dell computers for years so i figured when i needed a new one i would get a dell big mistake first ordering the computer took almost  hours with many calls to sales support the web site would not let me put into my cart what i ordered then when i finally got my cart almost correct gave up trying to get what i really wanted it would not let me checkout finally had to email what i wanted to sales support and they entered the info  weeks later the computer arrived and failed to boot so i called dell support they kept telling me the computer model they had on record for the service tag id of my new computer did not match the model of the computer recieved so they could not help me i spent the next hour getting bounced from person to person until the call just ended on the dell side i called back and managed to get someone that did want to help we got the computer booted up battery issue but then there was no wireless they never installed the drivers so now i have a computer that will not connect to the internet this has been a terrible experience and i hope to send the computer back tomorrow for a refund something has gone terribly wrong at dell do not buy a dell computer rohini dagade says february rd  at  am worst machine with low quality part dell sell the low quality laptop i purchased a laptop which has wifi issue from the first day of purchase part is replaced again with faulty part as dell dont manufactur quality part i

 at  pm dell computer piece of craptheir support fo their product is very poor regularguy says january th  at  pm how much did dell pay you for this review stay away from dell ive been a customer of dell since their beginning they started out really good the last two laptops i bought from them were lemons i decided to try again because i was a loyal customer maybe it was just those last two laptops so i purchased another one this one was by far the worst the weird bizarre problems that come up range from being unable to start the laptop sometimes sometimes certain keys on the keyboard stop working for days and then it will clear up and start working again this last laptop i bought from dell is my very last and hopefully i can help someone avoid save money and headache by avoiding dell entirely youd seriously be better off with asus ian nodell says january th  at  am i had three dell laptops through work first one was huge built like a tank and bomb proof second one was small built like a small tank and bomb proof third one was the biggest lemon i have ever seen in the world of computing equipment plagued with missing driver issues which dell tech corporate support took months to resolve then over the next  months five yes  five screen replacements one motherboard replacement and a partridge in a pear tree i ended up saying to our it department saying i refused to take it back a sixth time and they should tell dell to stick it somewhere they gave me a toshiba maybe i was just unlucky but five screens and a motherboard on a  year old laptop and they dont offer a replacement never again mitchell williams says december th  at  pm dell sucks so bad ive never had the run around so bad in all of my life or spoken to so many individuals that have accents that are hard to understand jeffrey says december th  at  pm dell uses aggressive tactics after you buy your laptop youre kind of stuck finding phone calls from people that say youre infected want you to buy dell sponsored software ill never buy a dell again because of that mrjay says november th  at  pm i am looking for a multipurpose laptop that does quick books  normal internet activities photo and video management  mostly storage etc i have narrowed it down to and xps latitude or the inspiron  id like an i  tb storage  ram hd im not sure about dual or quad coremy computer knowledge is limited touch screen not needed any suggestions or recommendations thanks nick from chicago says november th  at  pm i am looking for a home computerno idea where to start i use it to apply for jobs resumes other document files photo storage cd burning internet searching i had a sony for years but downloaded a bad virus should i get it repaired and update the windows software or start over again any suggestions would be appreciatedthanks ñįłeh pťeł says november th  at  pm i have dell laptop its has i proceser   gb ram   bt hd   gb gc and cool fetures henry says november th  at  am the computer that i bought has served me well except for one thing the charger that came with the product is supposedlyt not compatible with hte computer sometimes it works but two thirds of the time it says some nonsense about the charger being unknown and that the computer wont work properly before snailing through basic processes and refusing to charge like a grumpy schoolboy im left trying to reinsert it repeatedly as if i was haplessly playing a game of doctor and worried that the alarm was going to go off dells decision to try and force everyone to buy all of their replacement parts at high rice from them by making everything else incompatible in faux iitation of apple is pathetic and they should get over themselves i will continue to use this computer but i will probably never buy another one unless i absolutely have to essentially because i hate the company gregory says november th  at  am bought two dell inspirons a  inch that died two months after purchase under warranty thankfully and motherboard was replaced and a  multiple issues touchpad hinge low range wifi that died as soon as the warranty expired decided not to replace motherboard as it would had been  and who know how long before it would fail again i ended up buying a lenovo g as we have another one in the family that is very fast and with zero issues dell used to be good no more kerika says october th  at  am i

research and writing a book not interested in games but photos and communication capabilities wondering what would be dells suggestion d james says september th  at  pm the business range look great however from experience id avoid the cheap consumer laptops as they are very flimsy and underpowered for the os they come bundled with not a company to buy a budget machine from dr david garber says

levels not a gamer just for business efficiency suggestionssales thank you david another shafted dell customer says september rd  at  am he is still awaiting  months later for refund of ommitted pro version customer service continues to pacify  be careful if you order from dell former dell owner says september th  at  pm my son saved for quite awhile to buy a dell only to have it die a month after the warranty was up dell support was pretty good on the phone but in the end the processor and mother board were both dead i would never buy another dell product ritesh says september th  at  am i want dell laptop of th generation with i waqas hussain says september th  at  pm i want a need hp laptop core i core i andor dell in th generation with  to gb ram  to  processor hard is  gb please tell the prices of these dominic says september nd  at  pm i have been using dell products for about  years now and for them they are easy to fix and price to quality ratio is really good and to you frank and cappy your reviews are dank and crapy chris says august th  at  am i have bough a dell laptop for the second time in january this year in less then  months dell had to change the hard drive twice and the mother board out of those  months i was without my laptop for over  weeks barely an apology was given of course neither any reasons or compensation  at least an extended warranty  as they never admitted my equipment was faulty i have sent  complaints  emails and post  in the past  weeks and have just received a final rude email which is published below no one bothered to reply one of the worst customer service it just proves dell is happy for individual customers to buy their products but just pray nothing wrong happens if you are not a corporate company where they will bend backward to get your â£â£â£â£â£ we are too small fish  i write to you on behalf of dellâ€™s executive customer support team and we are the single point of contact for all correspondence emailslettersfax received at any of our worldwide corporate offices addressed to our executives please note dell has assisted you as per the warranty and we regret to inform you that we will be unable to compensate for any time or data loss as communicated before as much as we aspire to offer computers printers which are fault free technical issues with computers printers could arise and one can have the system serviced according to warranty policy please note this is the last point of escalation and this is dells final position in the matter we are not in a position to offer you any compensation we also believe the courts will look on this as a reasonable offer should you wish to bring a claim against dell we must inform you we will defend our position i regret you feel your experience with dell on this occasion has not met with your expectations of course i am available should you wish to discuss the matter any further regards vishwesh kamat dell  advanced resolution group dont buy dell products  you have better things to do rebecca h says august rd  at  pm dells customer service is the worst ive ever experienced what is up with selling computers that dont have ethernet ports what is up with keeping customers on telephone hold for  to  hours not resolving the issues and not providing adequate technical support before you know it  your warranty is up seemingly only because they kept you on hold for so long no more dells for me ever john hudon says july th  at  pm bought dell for my wife on valentines day as of july  the laptop has crashed  times and has inoperable for two months dealing with tech support laptop still does not work and dell is saying the return period is up i cant believe dell has back slid so much i will never purchase another dell product marge says july th  at  pm made the mistake of buying a dell laptop directly from dell online the monitor and other hardware failed within  months after only minimal use i sent it back and the returned it to me still broken spent between pm and midnight on the phone with incredibly unknowledgeable tech support people who seemed to be trying to wear us down and giving us the runaround we were patient and kind with them we finally turned dell in to both federal and local government consumer affairs for an investigation in the mean time  down the drain with a computer that is under a year old and supposedly still under warranty valerie inglis says july th  at  pm i just acquired my first dell  an inspiron  i found it extremely slow and the drive was chattering almost continuously i called tech support philippines and went through hours of troubleshooting  including a reset the problems persisted so the tech sent a replacement drive that i had to install they also sent a thumb drive with the operating system  for me to install the laptop has no internet now nor does it have an ethernet port now what do they want me to do i am awaiting the next email from them i will never buy a dell in the future and will recommend the same to anyone who will listen shame on dell dikshit rekhi says july th  at  pm shit laptopsproblem problem and only problemi wasted my money

problem we recently started buying this becos of nvidia but it is total pain iqbal butt says may th  at  pm i buy a brand new dell laptop from hell the laptop hard drive was bad and the laptop take  minutes to boot up i send the laptop to dell and when i get it back there is a dent on the top i send it back again and now they dont have a part please buy lenova sony abc xyz but dont buy dellhell dont buy dell says april th  at  am donâ€™t buy dell â€“ faulty products and terrible service  months ago i paid  for a brand new dell  laptop and  weeks ago it failed sure these things do occasionally happen and i was only slightly perturbed when i called dell support and i was almost relieved when i was told that as per my â€œnext business dayâ€ service option a technician would promptly arrive and replace the motherboard  business days later the first technician arrived and proceeded to try and remove the back cover however he was so inept that he completely stripped two of the screws â€“ not just one but two â€œnot to worryâ€ he assured me he would simply break the back cover to gain access but he would have to wait until dell could send a replacement cover  business days  he returned to wrench the back cover free from the screws he destroyed and finally replaced the motherboard however this â€œnewâ€ motherboard didnâ€™t work properly the laptop started but when he tried to turn it off the keyboard stayed illuminated the screen froze and there was no way of restarting then this supposed dell technician actually asked me â€œdoes this model normally do thatâ€ trying not to choke on my complete bewilderment i said â€œnoâ€ so while i waited for yet another â€œnewâ€ motherboard i decided to call dell to lodge a complaint i was told to put this in writing and send it to customer service which i did and i promptly received an automated reply stating that i would receive a response within  business hoursâ€¦ but i never heard anything  business days  a second technician arrived to install yet another motherboard which thankfully he managed to do without breaking anything else however dell had sent the wrong screws to replace the ones stripped by the first technician so i sent another mail to customer service and once again got the automated â€œwe will respond within  business hoursâ€  business days â€“ i finally heard from customer service but not to say sorry for the terrible service iâ€™d been receiving and not to say that my replacement screws were on the way but just to say that my service job would be closed within  hours i replied rather promptly to ask what had become of my missing screws to my surprise this person had absolutely no knowledge of my screwed screws and asked me to supply photographic proof which i duly did  business days â€“ and still no replyâ€¦ paying  for a laptop that fails after just  months is bad enough but to get this kind of terrible service is simply insulting unless you have a penchant for wasting money and time â€“ donâ€t buy dell pierre says april th  at  pm i bought a dell studio  in  with an extra warranty the power adapter went out after  years but it was replaced very quickly and for free thanks to the extra warranty my computer still run good i wonder if dell is still a good brand today it seems expensive krishna says april th  at  pm dell laptops that they sell to large corporates are the worst thing they cannot even learn from lenovo in terms of keyboard ergonomics let alone mac the surface edges are not rounded for a resting parm  corners can peel your skin the home delete keys are hidden away in the function key sequence  not prominently seperated the key combination that lits the keyboard is not the two corner keys to top it all if you plugged in an ethernet cable that has the clip protector tabs heck you cannot detach the cable without a mail opener to press the tab  thats how well they designed and tested the hinge that that bulges through out the frame of attachment between screen and base whole thing weighs like a brick private equity at work putting lipstick on a pig jim m says march nd  at  am you have to wonder about a website that supposedly does precise reviews of laptops and cant get simple math correct before publishing as far as dell is concerned tech support is pretty much useless but recently i spent some time chatting with a tech guy about a new machine and he was surprisingly knowledgeable and helpful i am considering a new dell display more comments back to top find a review all categories laptops tablets
