calculated from the numbers for the whole company pe ratiomarket capnet income there are at least three kinds of pe ratios used by different investors they are trailing twelve month pe ratio or pe ttm forward pe or pe nri a new pe ratio based on inflationadjusted normalized pe ratio is called shiller pe after yale professor robert shiller in the calculation of pe ttm the earnings per share used are the earnings per share over the past  months for forward pe the earnings are the expected earnings for the next twelve months in the case of pe nri the reported earnings less the nonrecurring items are used for the shiller pe the earnings of the past  years are inflationadjusted and averaged the result is used for pe calculation since it looks at the average over the last  years shiller pe is also called pe explanation the pe ratio can be viewed as the number of years it takes for the company to earn back the price you pay for the stock for example if a company earns  a share per year and the stock is traded at  the pe ratio is  therefore it takes  years for the company to earn back the  you paid for its stock assuming the earnings stays constant over the next  years in real business earnings never stay constant if a company can grow its earnings it takes fewer years for the company to earn back the price you pay for the stock if a companys earnings decline it takes more years as a shareholder you want the company to earn back the price you pay as soon as possible therefore lowerpe stocks are more attractive than higher pe stocks so long as the pe ratio is positive also for stocks with the same pe ratio the one with faster growth business is more attractive if a company loses money the pe ratio becomes mearningless to compare stocks with different growth rates peter lynch invented a ratio called peg peg is defined as the pe ratio divided by the growth ratio he thinks a company with a pe ratio equal to its growth rate is fairly valued still he said he would rather buy a company growing  a year with a pe of  instead of a company growing  a year with a pe of  because the pe ratio measures how long it takes to earn back the price you pay the pe ratio can be applied to the stocks across different industries that is why it is the one of the most important and widely used indicators for the valuation of stocks similar to the pricesales ratio and pricecash flow or pricefree cash flow the pe ratio measures the valuation based on the earning power of the company this is where it is different from the pricebook ratio which measures the valuation based on the companys balance sheet be aware investors need to be aware that the pe ratio can be misleading a lot of times especially when the underlying business is cyclical and unpredictable as peter lynch pointed out cyclical businesses have higher profit margins at the peaks of the business cycles their earnings are high and pe ratios are artificially low it is usually a bad idea to buy a cyclical business when the pe is low a better ratio to identify the time to buy a cyclical businesses is the pricetosales ratio ps pe ratio can also be affected by nonrecurringitems such as the sale of part of businesses this may increase for the current year or quarter dramatically but it cannot be repeated over and over therefore pe nri is a more accurate indication of valuation than pe ttm related terms
