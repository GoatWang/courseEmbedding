bradstreet inc  all rights reserved business continuity  hutchinson shockey erley  co   hutchinson shockey erley  co business continuity this is a summary of the business continuity plan the “plan” of hutchinson shockey erley  co hse the plan is designed to address a significant business disruption affecting hse’s business operations conducted at its chicago headquarters and sets forth hse’s objectives of safeguarding employees recovering and resuming operations protecting books and records and enabling communications with employees investors key service providers and regulators all of hse’s mission critical systems and processes are conducted or located in chicago although the firm also has offices in milwaukee wisconsin phoenix arizona española new mexico denver colorado houston texas st clair shores michigan and los angeles california whether you are a customer of hse an issuer of municipal securities or a business partner you should be aware that hse is committed to planning for and being prepared for a significant business disruption the plan addresses two types of significant business disruptions – “internal” disruptions such as a fire in hse’s building affecting only hse’s ability to communicate and do business and “external” disruptions such as an event that might prevent the operation of the securities markets or a number of firms in either event hse’s goal will be to recover its critical business processes with minimal interruption on the same day if possible although the length of the disruption is expected to be longer in the event of an external disruption particularly one affecting the entire securities industry the plan covers hse’s critical business processes that are essential for hse to continue to conduct business for a temporary period during a business interruption every important aspect of hse’s securities business including communications with customers and issuers of municipal securities order entry and execution order clearance and public finance is addressed in these processes among the matters addressed in the plan are the following •alternative physical location of employees customers’ access to funds and securities data backup and recovery financial and operational assessments mission critical systems alternate communications between the firm and customers employees and regulators continuation of business with critical business constituents counter parties and banks communications with regulator information technology is central to hse’s operations hse has systems in place for the backup and recovery of information needed to conduct its business the plan identifies the functions processes and resources necessary to support the restoration and resumption of hse’s business customers of hse should note that hse does not have custody of customer securities and has custody of funds for only a small minority of its customers in the event of an internal or external significant business disruption if telephone service is available customers will continue to have access through normal channels to their investments and the ability to make purchases and sales despite hse’s experiencing a significant business disruption unless the disruption is industry wide in scope this summary is subject to modification from time to time as hse reviews the plan and its business operations customers may obtain a written copy of this summary by contacting hutchinson shockey erley  co chief financial officer by mail at  west adams st suite  chicago il  in conclusion hse’s plan addresses the steps hse will take to address a temporary business disruption in a systematic and organized fashion the effects of a disaster are of course difficult to predict and the disruption of systems and processes on an industrywide basis will pose great business continuity challenges for any firm in the securities industry there can be no assurance that any plan can address such unforeseen contingencies addendum in the event of a pandemic hse’s business continuity plan will be followed recent engagements  — education center international academy texas  — corpus christi
