contents  video library  jobs  service provider directory  definitions  faq blue ridge capital hedge fund  john a griffin holdings analysis  new york blue ridge capitalblue ridge capital  john a griffin holdings analysisthis post is being written as part of my investment securities tool which analyzes the holdings of hedge fund managersblue ridge capital is ran by john a griffin griffin is similar to steve mandel at lone pine capital and lee ainslie at maverick capital in that they all are tiger cubs aka pupils of julian robertson while at tiger management griffin though is more well known because he was julian robertsons right hand man so needless to say the dude knows his stuff blue ridge seeks absolute returns by investing in companies who dominate their industries and shorting the companies who have fundamental problems and right off the bat that presents us with a bit of a problem in terms of analyzing fs fs dont show short positions they show long positions unless the firm is short through puts which we can see so the inherent problem with analyzing blue ridge or any fund for that matter is that we cant see the other side of their portfolio but this is increasingly important for blue ridge simply due to griffins investment strategy and the fact that his long positions could in essence only represent half of the portfolio now i use that loosely because theres no way for me to know exactly how much of his portfolio is short but i do know that both griffin at blue ridge and lee ainslie over at maverick capital research on him coming later this week like to effectively hedge with a balance of both long and short positions like a true hedge fund not like some of these crazy funds these days with no true hedging heres the thing they dont do pairs trades so dont classify it as that in the past i remember specifically being told by representatives at maverick that they dont pairs trade even though a respective long and short could be in the same sector or subsector so make that distinction clear but well work with what weve got and believe me its still a lot of solid infobefore beginning i would like to give a special shoutout to alex prywes for helping me with the daunting task of analyzing f filings alex has helped gather and sort through the data of numerous hedge funds including the one below thanks to alexs help we can now cover even

anadarko petroleum apc  of the portfolio discovery holding co disca  of the portfoliobreakdown first thing i noticed was blue ridges addition of anadarko petroleum apc they added it in mass bringing it up to the funds th largest holding although ive seen many hedge funds adding this name over the past  quarters do keep in mind that this filing was as of june th  since then natural gas prices oil prices and pretty much any stock in those sectors have all plummeted but it is worth noting that i have seen this name pop up on f filings much more frequently recently and blue ridge did make quite a hefty purchase well have to wait until next quarter to see whether it was a trade or an investment in the past when griffin has brought a position up to a top  holding in one quarter he has held onto the position so time to play the waiting game on that one also he added quite a large new position in visa v bringing it up to  of the portfolio after not even holding a position last goround leaving it just shy of being a top  holdingnext i noticed he was adding more shares of wyeth wye this name was already a large fund holding and he added to his position by  bringing it up to the funds nd largest holding recently there has definitiely been a rotation into any and all stocks relating to healthcare this is no exception also worth noting is griffins addition to his already large apple aapl position he continues to add to this name and appears to be assembling a solid core position over timeeven though griffin made some purchases he was definitely busier on the selling side of things and that makes me even more curious than usual as to what short positions he holds but because hedge funds are not required to disclose short positions in their f filings except for put positions we are left in the dark on that one but anyways onto the sales griffin was selling some consumer names in netflix nflx and walmart wmt he only sold  of his positions there so it could just be some profit taking or position size reducing nothing too major going on well keep an eye on it next quarter and see if he continues to sell those names two quarters ago as i detailed in my blue ridge analysis we saw that griffin was starting to sell coach coh formfactor form and smurfit stone sscc this past quarter he continued that trend selling off all the remaining shares in those companies additionally he sold off  of his crocs crox position which im sure was a source of pain for him given how those shares have plummeted in value over time next quarter it will be interesting to see whether or not he sells off the cheap consumer plays such as walmart wmt and target tgtgriffin also completely removed america movil amx from blue ridges portfolio this is interesting as this is the nd hedge fund so far weve seen completely sell out of this name remember that amx used to be one of the most common holdings amongst the various hedge funds i track the stock has been in a downward spiral for numerous months and it appears that numerous hedge funds were the ones responsible for the exodus in the coming week well see what griffins tiger cub buddies were up to with their respective amx positions as wellalso worth pointing out is that griffin quickly sold out of burlington northern bni completely in the last f filing we found out he had just added bni as a new position and this time around we find out that he has quickly sold out this struck me as somewhat odd just because practically all hedge funds i track have some sort of exposure to the rails maybe griffin was just locking in some quick profits or maybe there was something that turned him away from the name interesting move nonetheless griffin also had a short stay in office depot odp he sold completely out of his position this past quarter having only added it as a new position in the last f filinglastly i just wanted to point out some of the larger positions that blue ridge continues to hold in their portfolio millipore mil covanta cva grupo televisa tv and charles schwab schw these positions have been top  holdings for blue ridge for numerous quarters now and are definitely worth a look as they appear to be longer term plays for griffinblue ridge capitals most interestingpeculiar moves increasing their stake in fannie mae fnm by over  bringing it up to  of the portfolio keep in mind that these positions were as of june th  i only bring this up due to the recent developments in fnm and fre whether it be for a trade or for an investment john griffin was definitely up to something here and we can only speculate as to what hes been doing with this position in the past month and a halfyou can view blue ridge capitals most recent f as filed with the sec hereguest post by market
