of tappan street partners holder of nordion common stock sends letter to the board of directors of nordion may    et from tappan street partners llc new york may   prnewswire  on may th  tappan street partners fund lp a private investment fund and owner of nordion common stock sent the board of directors a letter detailing our concerns with the recent offer to acquire the company at a price of  per share  a copy of the full letter is included below may  board of directorsattn corporate secretarynordion inc march roadottawa ontario kk x ladies and gentleman we are writing to you in our capacity as representatives of tappan street partners fund lp a private investment fund and owner of nordion the company shares  while we commend the board and management for engaging in a long strategic alternatives process with the hope of maximizing shareholder value we are concerned that the current offer of  per share in cash from sterigenics an affiliate of private equity firm gtcr collectively the acquirors materially undervalues the company  although we recognize the company undertook a thoughtful process we believe no natural buyer exists for all of nordions disparate assets leading to a suboptimal outcome for shareholders  in particular we are concerned that the current offer was accepted prior to a material positive change in the sterilization industry that could greatly benefit nordion and we believe it ascribes no value to nordions medical isotopes business going forward essentially giving the acquiror a free option on new supply and a business that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the future  absent a material change in terms we believe shareholders and the board are better off rejecting this offer as more value will likely accrue to shareholders from operating independently we believe the  per share offer from the acquirors materially undervalues nordion for the following reasons material change to the industry – we believe nordions sterilization business has many attractive characteristics longterm supply arrangements a razorrazor blade business model with high gross margins regulatory barriers to entry predictable and growing endmarkets very little capital expenditure requirements driving substantial free cash flow and a very dominant market position in a duopoly industry structure  subsequent to the merger announcement we believe this business has only gotten better  on april th  nordion announced that the other major supplier is discontinuing supply of co  as a result the company has raised its guidance for the sterilization segment from annual growth of  in  to annual growth of  a  increase  while we recognize that nordion management expects the supply to come back online the reasons for the discontinuation and any potential timing of the reentry to the market are unknown  at least temporarily nordions high quality business is essentially now a monopoly which we believe warrants a very different valuation  at the very least nordions cash flow generation from the sterilization business will be materially higher than contemplated at the time bids were originally submitted inadequate multiple for sterilization – as discussed above we believe the sterilization business is a highquality operating segment for several reasons  even absent the nearterm and perhaps extended monopoly market position we believe the current price does not ascribe full value for this segment  under reasonable growth scenarios for next year excluding the bolus of sales from disruptions at the competition and potential sales from production irradiators nordions sterilization business should be able to generate nearly mm of aftertax cash flow  for businesses with such dominant market positions stable growth and significant barriers to entry we believe cash flow multiples in the high teens are very reasonable  valued at x nordions sterilization business alone would be worth  per share  coupled with the existing net cash this alone would yield a valuation above the current price  assuming the monopoly market position persists we estimate fair value of sterilization to be nearly  per share higher than our  per share estimate that assumes the return of competitive supply  importantly we believe free cash flow and not ebitda is the most relevant metric for this or any other business  nordions low capital expenditure requirements make ebitdabased valuations much less appropriate  by way of comparison the average business in the sp  trades at a free cash flow multiple of x – x and we think the sterilization business is much higher quality than the average company  additionally as the merger proxy detailed it seems some prospective buyers were interested in acquiring only one segment which could be one reason that the overall bid may undervalue the companys individual segments little value given for medical isotopes – given our estimates of fair value for sterilization corporate costs and existing cash on the balance sheet we think the current bid provides little more than runoff value for the companys medical isotopes business  this is not particularly surprising given that the buyer is not in this business segment  instead we think sterigenics is getting a largely free option on securing future medical isotope supply  nordion has been a leading player in mo supply for many years and we think the company has a very strategic position in the industry  with approximately  thousand medical procedures done daily that utilize mo we think this global shortage is likely to be resolved and nordion should be a part of that solution  while we recognize that additional supply is not a guarantee we also struggle to understand why shareholders should transfer this valuable option to the acquirors for free  at even modest multiples of free cash flow going forward the medical isotopes business could be worth another  relative to the current offer of  per share  in fact we think management agrees  although the medical isotope business will be a new sector opportunity to sterigenics we are in agreement that the business offers an attractive market with growth potential and sterigenics supports nordions efforts to secure longterm isotope supply – steve west nordion ceo –  conference call conflicts of interest with the fairness opinion – we were surprised to learn that the companys advisor jefferies had been seeking additional business from gtcr and has been engaged by gtcr on another assignment  while we understand that investment banks do business with a variety of constituents we think the fact that jefferies raised this potential conflict with management on march th just three days before the deal was announced and after much of the process had been wrapped up is cause for concern  in fact the company then excluded jefferies from further discussion in order to mitigate any perceived conflict of interests  the path forward we will not vote in favor of the merger arrangement under the current terms because we believe the  per share value significantly undervalues the company  we would certainly entertain higher offers from either party a or the acquirors but absent that we believe shareholders are better off operating independently at least until the market dynamics around sterilization and longterm medical isotope supply are better known  while rejecting the offer may lead to shortterm turbulence in the share price of nordion the company has the best defense possible  significant cash on the balance sheet to buy back shares at an attractive valuation  ultimately shareholders will decide with their vote but we strongly encourage the board to reconsider the offer in order to ensure that shareholders receive fair value for their shares sincerely prasad phatak and chris korandamanaging memberstappan street partners llc contactinfotappanstcomwwwtappanstcom  nordion information circular dated april   page    source tappan
