explanatory style have been identified as dispositions that bolster health roben and salovey  this research focused on individual differences in optimism hardiness and explanatory style among professional adults and their relative contribution to general wellbeing a survey was mailed to attorneys who were members of the county bar association in a large midwestern city the results showed only optimism and the positive internal facet of explanatory style to be significantly related to general wellbeing canonical analysis indicated that this relationship was mainly due to the components of general wellbeing that are traditionally psychological in nature the experiential and physical components were significantly related but of less importancepreviewunable to display preview download
