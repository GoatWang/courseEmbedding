smart systems platform overview smart systems acquire relevant data evaluate the real time situation represented by that data and respond to the identified situation either by taking a direct automated action or by advising a user or another system that an action is warranted by the current situation such a system consists of data definitions for storing the sensor data and the situational state logic for detecting and responding to situations and data transport to move the data to the appropriate location for evaluation and storage for example a specific situation might be defined as the weather is rainy and cold the user is attending a baseball game the game is delayed if all these conditions are true the desired situation is encountered and the system might notify an application that will then recommend various courses of action for the user for example the system might offer to bring the user hot coffee or perhaps offer to sell them a souvenir waterproof jacket in real time or near real time environments processing is always better performed locally to the device under control improving response time and reliability for example in an industrial setting managing the position of a materials handling system requires near real time responses within a few hundred milliseconds such response times cannot be guaranteed by a remote decision making system that may be delayed by âs of milliseconds if there is network congestion vantiq is a high productivity highperformance distributed system vantiq consists of technologies for obtaining data from iot sources and enterprise sources filtering the data and making it available to the automation decision engine decision engine for analyzing the data in real time and making business decisions based on the results technologies for sending control information to iot devices and for notifying external systems and users of the decisions being made by the automation solution the solution affords the user high productivity by supporting the specification of the automation system at a much higher level than traditional service platforms it also offers a set of tools that make the development deployment operation and management of the automation system as easy as possible since the data is externally sourced and the results must be delivered to external systems a key to high productivity is flexible but simple integration capabilities for sources and devices vantiq offers high performance by supporting a highly scalable cloud architecture incorporating a number of performance specific optimizations as well as local service deployments to support processing distributed to the network and to private data centers the solution is fully distributed supporting the transparent development and optimization of automation solutions that span all layers of the distributed environment conceptual model new events stream into the service from external data sources if the arriving data is relevant to a particular rule the rule is “triggered” and scheduled for execution the rule may update the model state and if the defined situation is detected the corresponding actions defined by the rule are executed vantiq detects specific situations as defined by rules the rules are activated by changes to data streams that are presented to the service in the above example the data streams might be the weather conditions the user’s location and the baseball game’s state the actions taken when a situation is detected might delivery notifications request a recommendation or change the situational state defining data streams the first step in creating a solution is to define the inbound data multiple data streams may be defined in the above example three streams were defined weather user location game status each stream is represented by a type in the automation data model the types are defined by the application developer and their definitions are only constrained by the capabilities of the data model processing is initiated when an object is inserted updated or deleted in one of the data stream types for example the weather type could be defined using the json representation  the situation is named “weatherexample” as specified in the “rule” clause the triggering condition is a change to the “weather” type as specified in the “when” clause a change to weather causes a reevaluation of the current weathersituation the rule states that if the current temperature is less than  degrees f and the windspeed is greater than  mph and the precipitation is greater than  inches the current weather situation should be updated to “poor” the then clause publishes a notification to the specified url and stores the new situation in the weathersituation type using the documentation these simple examples illustrate essence of automation using vantiq the remainder of the documentation provides a number of fully worked examples as well as descriptions of each vantiq feature and the details necessary to use the feature effectively we recommend starting with the tutorials that contain fully worked example automation systems overview source tutorial edge analytics image map tutorial debugging tutorial the api reference guide and the resource reference guide contain detailed information on the available resources and the structure of the rest api for

vantiq isvs  sis franz aman t vantiq for isvs  sis the collaboration architecture of vantiq enables isvs and sis to easily build systems that keep people in the loop independent software vendors isvs and system integrators sis vantiq is wellsuited to meet the needs of isvs and sis vantiq is an apaas application platform as a service environment the platform allows partners to rapidly develop and offer their applications as a service in the cloud private cloud andor onpremises at the customer locations the collaboration architecture of vantiq enables isvs and sis to easily build systems that keep people in the loop for many applications this will offer significant competitive advantage and enable them to “set the stage” where others cannot easily follow vantiq provides modern apibased interoperability by leveraging rest web sockets and common messaging protocols mqtt amqp integration with external services supporting specialized functionality modern or legacy can be easily added to an application functionality developed in vantiq can also be called as a service isvs independent software vendors isvs can leverage vantiq’s solutions to update their applications in realtime deploy functionality incrementally and install in each customer’s distributed deployment environment without having to rewrite or update application logic service improvements or fixes can be rapidly deployed to all of the clouds or edge devices in a distributed environment vantiq allows application logic to be placed into a configuration a grouping of rules procedures types and sources which can be automatically distributed turned onoff as requested and set to run on all or a limited set of nodes configurations are named and can be versioned they provide an easy way for isvs to provide advanced capabilities to their customers and then reuse them where appropriate through vantiq business opportunities can be identified in realtime with the ability to then provide highly specific content eg specialized procedures training materials to connected users this provides an isv the opportunity to offer incremental valueadded services at any time isvs system integrators once systems are deployed ongoing maintenance and dynamic changes to application logic cloud or edge can be remotely managed to improve performance remove defects or respond to critical business changes a configuration a grouping of rules procedures types and sources can be implemented removed andor activated remotely to update functionality of an application vantiq’s configurations and other unique capabilities enable system integrators to provide valueadded services for their customers throughout the lifecycle of an engagement this becomes even more important with collaborative systems as improvements in human procedures and recommendations are susceptible to rapid change vantiq allows components built for a specific vertical market such as retail or process manufacturing to be easily reused in new systems enabling rapid deployment and higher levels of reliability components can be designed or reused that report on noncompliance issues corporate regulatory or business process with vantiq sis can deliver functionality to their customers using an incremental approach this allows revisions to business processes to occur at an appropriate speed for success this applies to both the scale of transformation delivered and the breadth to which it is deployed for example when rolling out new functionality it might make sense to automate only a few warehouses at a time or allowing employees and suppliers to adapt to changes in the supply chain might dictate that a new delivery system add only one major function per month vantiq supports integration and deployment flexibility to a degree that is unique in today’s environments summary vantiq was designed from the beginning to offer many features to enable isvs and sis to deliver functionality faster and with dramatically less effort with the focus on collaboration vantiq enables its partners to leap ahead of their competitors vantiq is the only solution in the market to enable the collaboration between systems and people

japanese product – vantiq product franz aman t the vantiq application platform whatsensing the world analyzing the world acting on the world result what vantiq does the vantiq application platform allows every company to rapidly build deploy and run realtime business applications driven by datastreams of any kind including data from existing systems and people sense analyze and act realtime business applications built in vantiq can sense analyze and act on what is happening in real time to drive immediate business results by effectively utilizing and augmenting the innumerable and growing modern technologies sensing the word realtime applications built with vantiq ingest multiple streams of data and events to continuously and accurately reflect the real world data streams originating in the environment such as new readings from realtime sensors requests from mobile devices and changes in a legacy system are continuously fed into the sense stage of the application this stage also translates and aggregates external data to create events within the system and maintains an internal current state representation of the environment analyzing the world the analyze stage identifies situations of interest where immediate action is required to solve a problem or capitalize on an opportunity the sense stage provides information but lacks knowledge of what is important the analysis stage continuously analyzes changes in the environment by using business rules external services and  imported machine learning models to identify situations of interest that subsequently get resolved in the act stage acting on the world realtime applications use automation where possible and collaboration where necessary to achieve the desired outcomes as situations of interest occur the act stage is responsible for intelligently managing how the system responds applications built with vantiq support two modes of action automation and collaboration automated responses may be taken directly by the application or may be forwarded to a more specialized system for implementation collaboration includes intelligent interaction between the system and the responsible individuals to respond to a situation   the result increased business agility the vantiq platform drastically shortens timetovalue and increases agility by hiding complexity so developers building realtime applications can focus on delivering realtime business value not infrastructure to learn how the vantiq platform hides the underlying complexities of building modern software applications to deliver
