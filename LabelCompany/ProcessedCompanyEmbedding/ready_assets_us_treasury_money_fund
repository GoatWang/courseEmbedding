discount rates or a range of discount rates paid at the time of purchase   • fair value measurements  various inputs are used in determining the fair value of investments these inputs to valuation techniques are categorized into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three broad levels for financial reporting purposes as follows       • level  — unadjusted price quotations in active marketsexchanges for identical assets and liabilities that the fund has the ability to access       • level  — other observable inputs including but not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities such as interest rates yield curves volatilities prepayment speeds loss severities credit risks and default rates or other marketcorroborated inputs       • level  — unobservable inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances to the extent observable inputs are not available including the fund’s own assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments     the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  measurements accordingly the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety   changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers into or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy in accordance with the fund’s policy transfers between different levels of the fair value disclosure hierarchy are deemed to have occurred as of the beginning of the reporting period the categorization of a value determined for investments is based on the pricing transparency of the investment and is not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those
