intrepid select fund are nondiversified meaning that compared to diversified mutual funds the fund may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a particular issuer a nondiversified funds shares may be more susceptible to adverse changes in the value of a particular security than would be the shares of a diversified mutual fund thus a nondiversified fund may be more sensitive to economic business and political changes because of the larger impact of fluctuation in the values of securities of fewer issuers the intrepid capital endurance select and international funds invest in smaller companies which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility the intrepid capital income and disciplined value funds invest in debt securities which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise this risk is usually greater for longer term debt securities investment by these funds in lowerrated and nonrated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higherrated securities the funds may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods the risks of owning etfs generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities they are designed to track although lack of liquidity in an etf could result in it being more volatile than the underlying portfolio of securities etfs also have management fees that increase their costs versus the costs of owning the underlying securities directly adrs may be subject to some of the same risks
