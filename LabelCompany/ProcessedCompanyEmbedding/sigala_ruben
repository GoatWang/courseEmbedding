cateriano phd vice president and chief analytics officer at ford motor credit company ruben sigala chief analytics officer at caesars entertainment and michael wu phd chief scientist at lithium technologies the panel tackled the insandouts of their various datacentric cultures with humor and insight “analytics as a function grew at ford motor credit because we had a president who joined from american express who had a vision” explained cateriano “for me the chief analytics officer appointment is about developing a skilled team for credit originally we had to push our services but now our key executives turn to our data analytics to solve the problem i would say  of the time they are pulling us to the table” dr wu chief scientist at lithium technologies says that because his company
