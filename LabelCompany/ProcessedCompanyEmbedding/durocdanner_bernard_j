the call to krishna krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you karen and good morning everyone let me start with a brief recap of our operating performance in the first quarter overall this was a disappointing quarter reflecting a sudden plunge in revenue across all regions led by north american while our aggressive cost reduction actions were not enough to stem the revenue drop resulting in a sharp decline in operating margins loss per share for the quarter before charges and credits was  revenue of  billion for the quarter decreased  sequentially and  year on year the sequential decline was affected by a sharp decrease in the level of product sales as customers around the world cut back on product spending which is partly seasonal after a strong q and partly reflective of the new lower  spending budget kicking in for these customers product sales were down  sequentially mainly in the us canada asia pacific middle east and latin american markets with the artificial lift and completion product lines declining the most excluding the decrease in product sales service revenue was down  sequentially in line with our peers operating income margins before rd and corporate expenses declined by  basis points sequentially to negative  excluding the rigs business our core business revenue decreased  sequentially with a  basis point deterioration in operating income margins to negative  right though this long down cycle weve been cutting costs and reducing our structure to cope with reduced activity and pricing pressures this was evidenced by our  decrementals versus  which were best in class at  while we continued to reduce costs in  we have now reached the point in several operating locations around the world where any further reductions in structure or in cost will mean exiting the business in those locations this means that we have reached a point where we will incur shortterm operating losses by continuing operations at these locations we have chosen to maintain this minimum cost structure as the difficulty and the cost of rebooting and rebuilding our businesses when activity levels eventually increase far outweigh the shortterm benefit of eliminating these businesses altogether in all we are carrying about  million in such costs representing  basis points of margin and about  in earnings per share terms in our q results below operating margins rd costs reduced by  million while corporate costs were down  million reflecting spending cuts in line with the reduced budgets for this year the tax benefit recorded in the first quarter reflected the tax benefit on the losses in the us primarily which are recoverable partly offset by tax provisions internationally the tax rate for  will be dependent on the geographical mix of earnings and will be heavily weighted by results in the united states excluding the rigs business sequential decrementals were  on a  revenue drop and yearoveryear decrementals were reasonable at  on a  revenue decrease adjusting operating income for rd and corporate expenses our sequential decrementals improved to  while the yearoveryear decrementals improved to  we expect to hold sequential decrementals in the low s going forward while the yearoveryear decrementals should hold in the mids bernard will comment in more detail on the operating results and the outlook later in the call coming to net debt and cash flow now net debt reduced by  million to reach  billion at march  this reflects mainly the net proceeds from the equity offering of  million partly offset by consumption of  million in operations this quarter the negative free cash flow performance while disappointing was significantly better than the  million free cash flow consumption of q in  despite recording much steeper losses this year all our larger peers recorded negative free cash flow in the first quarter this year however we were the only ones to improve versus q of last year on the free cash flow metric excluding the cash flow consumption of  million on the zubair contract in iraq  million of severance and restructuring cash costs and  million of outofperiod interest payments free cash flow was a negative  million for the quarter working capital balances reduced by  million reflecting strong customer collections and inventory reductions capex was wellcontrolled and was low at  million as of march  available liquidity was  billion the debttocap calculation came in at  versus the  covenant meaning there was significant headroom against the covenant i would now like to update our free cash flow forecast of the year primarily due to the large unexpected losses in q and the continuing trough into q we now revise our fullyear free cash flow forecast to be between  million and  million this downward revision by  million versus our previous forecast takes into account three parameters lower earnings by  million partly offset by lower working capital principally receivables by  million and lower capex by  million losses for the year will be higher reflecting the unexpected sharp drop in activity and pricing levels in q which is expected to persist into q with lower revenue receivables will generate additional liquidity of  million and given the low spend in q a  million capex revised target for the year should not be difficult to achieve particularly with the low start to the year consistent with the previous forecast this new forecast assumes that we will strike an outofcourt settlement agreement on change orders with our customer on the zubair epf contract in iraq if we are not successful in reaching a satisfactory settlement we will take the matter to an international arbitration panel and while the cash settlement in this scenario could well be delayed into  we believe the settlement through an arbitration process would be for a significantly larger amount such a turn of events could reduce this years free cash flow forecast by an additional  million to  million discussions with our client are ongoing the progress on the zubair project has been very good with only three final milestones remaining out of  to be achieved we expect these milestones to be achieved by the end of may we successfully repaid the bond of  million that matured in february  as well as certain other shortterm facilities totaling  million with this revised free cash flow forecast we expect net debt levels to reduce to below  billion by the end of the year moving on to the new credit facility now given the environment we are in and the extreme pressure banks are facing with their exposure to the energy principally ep industry with significant loan loss provisions being recorded by almost every bank this was not the ideal time to negotiate a revolver for a noninvestment grade name like ours however as our current revolver was due to expire in july  we had no choice but to renegotiate this facility before it went current after over two months of difficult discussions and an extremely thorough examination by our banks i am pleased to announce that we have successfully negotiated new financing agreements which will be effective from next week and replace the current facility here are the key features of this new financing facility firstly it includes a secure term loan of  million this term loan matures in july  next it includes an unsecured revolver of  billion expiring in july  both of these new facilities are enhanced by appropriate upstream subsidiary guarantees a residual revolver totaling  million expiring in july next year covering banks that declined to extend the current facility is also available of the  banks in our previous facility  of them agreed to extend their cover with only four of the  reducing their commitment slightly two banks declined to participate in the extension but their current commitments will stay in place until july  this demonstrates the strong relationship we have with the majority of our banking group who share our common view of the future the term loan will amortize down  annually while the revolver will amortize down by  in the first year and then by  annually after that but will not reduce below  billion we will have the following covenants to adhere to during the life of the facilities firstly a specified debttoebitda ratio of below  times until the end of  and then below  times after that as of march  on a backtest we are at  times versus the  times meaning theres plenty of headroom for covenant purposes specified debt is defined as the debt enhanced by subsidiary guarantees and represents only the drawn amounts against the facilities while the ebitda is defined to exclude all noncash charges such as impairments and writeoffs of assets secondly we have a covenant which is defined as follows a specified debt plus letters of credit – that means the sum total of the two – to ebitda ratio of below  times until the end of  and then below  times after that the only difference from the previous covenant is the addition of outstanding letters of credit or guarantees to the level of specified debt and a higher ratio by one turn to accommodate these lcs as of march  on a backtest we are at  times versus the requirement of  times meaning again theres plenty of headroom theres also a third covenant which is specified assets to specified debt – we must maintain a ratio of at least  times as of march  this ratio is at  times meaning again theres substantial headroom on the third covenant based on our forecast over the life of the facility we expect to retain and in fact improve the headroom versus these three covenants as we negotiated these covenants at a time when the industry is at a trough we were able to secure extremely accommodating covenants which have almost no danger of breach during the life of the facilities we also ran a stressed model assuming a flat  oil price until the end of  this model results in flat revenue ebitda and free cash flow in  and  at  levels or slightly lower even under such a draconian set of assumptions we retain significant headroom versus these three negotiated covenants finally the debttocap covenant that existed up until now has been discarded and is not valid anymore just to be clear we will have a  billion facility starting next week down from  billion this facility will reduce to  billion after amortization in july  then itll reduce down to  billion as of july  and so on such a reduction should not be viewed as constraining to weatherford as a matter of fact the total actual drawdown against the facilities for the last several quarters have been as follows  billion as of th september last year  million as of last yearend and now  billion as of the end of the first quarter this year which are far below any of these levels that i mentioned at its lowest point of availability which is  billion as of july  we still have sufficient headroom when recent utilization levels of approximately  billion are taken into account as a reminder we also maintain roughly  million of cash balances on an ongoing basis so when you net that off against the outstanding revolver youve got to reduce  million of cash is roughly fungible i would like to also remind you that off a total gross debt of  billion at march  only the revolver drawdown of  billion has any financial covenants attached to it the remaining debt comprising mainly longterm bonds which is over  of our total debt do not carry any ratiodriven covenants nor do they carry any credit rating triggers i would like to conclude my prepared remarks by addressing our plan to manage the upcoming bond maturities over the next several years the total value of bond maturities from  through to  is  billion here is how we plan to finance the repayment of these bonds firstly free cash flow is expected to be in the  million to  million range this year as i explained previously add to that a range of  million to  million annually of free cash flow for each of the next four years and you get a total of  billion to  billion these cash flows assume a recovering and strengthening oilfield services market resulting in improved margins – improving margins but solid incrementals given the reduction on a fixed cost base and despite investment in working capital to fuel the growth capex will continue to be muted as our excess capacity gets fully utilized delaying significant growth capex spending into  next we expect to divest the land rigs business over the next three years when industry conditions and valuations get better our current estimate is that the cash component of such a transaction would be between  million and  billion lastly we will opportunistically tap the public debt markets to refinance some of these bond maturities and over the next four years we believe debt markets will be open to us in reality we believe there is a highyield market open to us even today in conclusion a combination of free cash flow proceeds from asset sales and potential new debt issuances will allow us to comfortably manage the upcoming debt maturities with that i will now turn the call over to bernard bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you krishna and good morning everyone few comments on q results historically q is always our worst quarter this years the same the four key numbers are revenue declined  sequentially  year on year decrementals of  sequentially and  year on year free cash flow was  million use of cash  million better than q  and that without any consideration for large severance cash payments and final cash outlay for the zubair free cash flow doesnt matter for our peers as it does for us given balance sheet differentials it is worth observing weatherfords free cash flow numbers as is inclusive of all were the best – or the least bad if you will – in class yearonyear performers of our peer group this isnt an accident the company has at all levels of operations an ingrained focus on cash flow here and now and perennially breaking down q revenues into its main components product sales dropped by over  service revenues by  and rigs by  this added up to a sequential  drop product sales usually drop sequentially in q and this year was no exception the overwhelming majority of the drop was seasonal and particularly affected the eastern hemisphere product sales for weatherford are well construction except trs and managed pressure drilling completion and lift service revenues are tubular running services mpd and formation evaluation taken together the proportion of product sales to the total revenues is on average about  with large quartertoquarter variations product sales will improve in q seasonally regionally the quarter was difficult in every corner of the world both the us and canada were very challenged canadas q was the lowest in companys recorded history for first quarter normally that regions strongest seasonal peak q was in fact lower than q of last year during a then already very depressed breakup its quite unimaginable the activity crash the us was just as bad but no worse than canada thanks to tremendous effort around sales operational execution and extreme cost management much of our market performance was exemplary except for two service lines which have consistently handicapped our us operations pressure pumping and rentals no surprise there with  of us revenues in q being counted for  of the losses those numbers say it all revenues for nam declined by  and decrementals were a more severe  yearonyear decrementals were held at  a  revenue decline which was excellent cost management in the midst of a collapsing volume and pricing environment for the first time in  months we held back on further organizational cost action in nam beyond what was planned by march with only a few exceptions we decided not to curtail employee counts or basin presence any further we decided to keep some measure of staffing in place in us and canada on furlough waiting on market direction beyond q latin america held better than nam albeit it was also very strained revenues declined by  sequentially decrementals were held at  also at a very decent  year on year by aggressive cost control all country operations declined except argentina colombia traditionally one of our largest latin american operations was eviscerated brazil and mexico weakened further we had already seriously curtailed venezuela last year so the operational minimum necessary fell onto our nucleus organization and infrastructure eastern hemisphere experienced a severe seasonal in addition to cyclical downturn in activity as highlighted earlier our product sales were very low in the quarter representing much of the companys overall product sales drop that drove  lower revenues and  decrementals sequentially – high for us because product sales typically carry higher margins cost reductions could not help as much as they will they lagged north america for local regulatory reasons by about two quarters in the european caspian russian ssa region revenue was down  reflecting sharp seasonal winter declines in russia and north sea coupled with project cancellations across ssa ssa margin has dipped ever so slightly into negative territory as costs could not make up for activity reduction fast enough revenues in middle east and asia pacific region decreased by  with margins dropping to just under  with sharp seasonal declines across several parts of the asia pacific region mena showed resilience but much was offset by a combination of very low part sales in the quarter and the full effect of pricing concessions lastly the rig operations as expected had a difficult quarter it was a transitional quarter as we moved rigs into new markets we mobilized on new contracts on the cost side we announced earlier this year an additional reduction in force of  as of the end of april almost  or  employees had already left the payroll substantially completing the program we extended the program to cover another  reduction in force bringing it to  if you will which we expect to complete by the end of q annualized savings already crystallized from actions to date are specifically  million with savings impacting q to the tune of  million so the bulk of it is coming in q et cetera the next two quarters will show much higher levels of savings from the actions to date similarly the cash cost of the severance program was heavy in q heavier than we expected there will be lower severance cash payouts in q as a corollary we had also announced the closure of nine manufacturing facilities this year of this four were shut in q alone in addition  operating and service facilities were shut down in north america during the quarter all this added to a difficult but productive quarter which was expected and also we believe will set the trough for the year in this cyclical depression which brings me to the outlook for q nam results will be weaker in q revenues will decline q on q similarly to q and q the depth and breadth of cost cuts achieved will improve the decrementals versus q but the regions operating income will decline further we believe q though will be the trough for weatherfords nam latin america will also be weaker in q but substantially less than now in terms of decline q will look similar to q and will likely have singledigit lower revenues and operating income no worse we also believe q will be the trough for weatherford latin america eastern hemisphere in q will be up modestly q on q revenues and more significantly operating income the increase in revenues is one factor the different mix with a return of product sales is the other factor probably a larger factor together with a much lower cost basis the cost cuts have a lag remember and they will benefit eastern hemisphere starting from q this brings us to the following assessment we believe q will have been the trough for weatherfords eastern hemisphere lastly the rig operation will improve gradually its profitability in q and there on because of the mobilization q will have been the trough also for our rig operation now i do realize our assessment of both latin america and even more so eastern hemisphere for q is at a variance to our larger peers remember although we overlap and compete in formation evaluation and completion by and large we do not in what we call well construction and lift in well construction and lift we are more complementary than competitive and have at times a somewhat different prognosis timewise for performance adding the pieces together our view is that q will net out at a similar net income to q with a worse nam but a better international by the end of q well have concluded the bulk of our twoyear massive cost restructuring leaving behind only supply chain work underway the change in efficiency and cost structure make a very large and structural difference we also believe there will be seasonal and some early signs however modest of cyclical market improvements in q and q profitability in the second half  will be improved over the first half were preparing cautiously but with determination for the beginnings of a possible recovery the decision to opt for a furlough program in north america rather than more organizational shrinkage is a clear example of such the turn will come and will come early for us weatherford is more development than production and exploration we are more land than offshore were bestpositioned to benefit from the first turn in the market two examples in nam our completion and lift portfolios are directly applicable to the gradual completions of the drilled but uncompleted wells second the massive destocking of client inventories for rod lift and pcp lift equipment will be the first drivers of a turn thats for nam internationally russia and pockets of latin america will be the first movers while our middle east region will accelerate its rebuilding through the second half of the year again we remain very cautious but we are building our own conviction that second half  will be better for weatherford and the beginning of a longterm turn reiteration of  priorities at the time of this call we have successfully achieved banking commitments for our credit line through july  to replace existing lines successful equity offering of last march also provided additional liquidity both capital formation events are clear positives and place us on safe ground they do not change our free cash flow objectives free cash flow generation has ingrained the companys longterm direction we have total organizational buyin specific incentives and disciplined metrics on free cash flow objectives with the end of the rif or the reduction in force severance and the zubair financing our free cash flow performance the balance of the year will be strong and reliable well build on our operating progress today with more efficiency cash discipline and systematic talent upgrades and selective market share focus well delever the balance sheet through free cash flow each and every year and eventually with more asset sales when achievable this is our direction our cost of organizational actions to date centered around improving five things and doing so in a perennial way one lower cost structure through cycles out of an estimated annualized to date  billion of cost reductions realized since  we know specifically that over  billion are permanent or structural this means weatherford will have close to  a share of incremental earnings and cash flow above our prior earnings peak two capital allocation and cash generation is a companywide discipline this is ingrained in our culture three leapfrog talent bench and talent development as a culture we have upgraded our talent systematically from field to senior management weve made talent development into an organizational priority we never had operationally and financially as talented and deep of a bench as we have today we may be smaller we are much better managed four focus on quality and reliability for all product lines quality and reliability and execution everywhere all the time are a strategic priority i specifically commented on these internal objectives and priority in my recent comments at the opening ceremony of the atse conference in dehradun quality and reliability is our most important metric of operational achievement five technological innovation both incremental and step change channels strictly on our core so buttressing our leadership where we lead and gaining leadership where we dont during otc which is happening now we have hosted a threeday technology exhibition at one of our rd centers in houston we had more client attendance by far than we ever experienced we cannot afford to be technological leaders or coleaders on all product and service lines we can and will on our core as the massive cost containments come to an end i will summarize the cost accomplishments from the first days of  we believe we did more and further than anyone else reduction in force for a total employee count on january   of  we ended q  at  we expect a trough of total head count at about  shortly after q will have been  a  total company payroll reduction in  months this is a clean cost restructuring without any divestment to assist the numbers we took down our support ratio – which is indirects to directs or support to directs if you will – from  in  to where it presently stands at  a  sic  percentage point  decline in support ratio is a colossal structural change in record time to do this in a cyclical downturn is very difficult ph it is also  structural change will provide us with outsized incremental margins through the recovery years operations were streamlined with consolidation of our geographic segments flattening of the reporting organization scaling down regional headquarters and push the country closer to the sand face  supply chain is the midst of a twoyear restructuring and productivity leapfrog manufacturing logistics and procurement are implementing fundamental productivity and efficiency change this is an economic breakthrough for our operating cost structure flexibility of adjustment to changes in business volumes of all the ongoing cost initiatives this one alone will carry forward through  much of the above describes what we accomplished taking advantage of extremely depressed market conditions the operating decisions will now be adjusted were calling for an end to our reduction in force drive and organizational compression the last remnants of the layoffs will occur in q but beyond well arrest the direct cost drive and prepare cautiously but prepare nonetheless for a turn in our markets only the vast supply chain reorganization work will continue until full completion weatherford is well advanced in its fundamental transformation from cost structure cooperating practices and quality focus returns objective and a culture of sales we are a completely different company in the making our performance in the recovery to come will surprise to the upside i have a few comments on macro but ill keep them to a minimum we have long said that after a lag decline rates would accelerate that the effects were underestimated and the industry was producing at near capacity which is something none of us have ever experienced well also add in that the industry will not be able to manage required oil demand as early as  this means oil demand would not be met by existing oil capacity inventory overhang will help but by definition it isnt more than a stopgap solution we more than ever believe all the above is correct other than a few barrels coming from iran in theory one day from libya by our assessment the industry has little spare capacity beyond the present operating rates project announcements to the contrary we believe this to be accurate furthermore elasticity of supply response to higher oil prices are being ignored or overstated in my  years in the oilfield and my prior years watching my father operate in same i have never seen anything like it the full return cost of developing existing bases around the world including the us tight oil reservoirs will not work financially unless oil pricing and related financing change and change fast to a materially different level this is how we see our industry situation in summary regardless of the macro outcome were making weatherford focused operationally very strong disciplined and returnsdriven well never go down the same path to excessive leverage ever again we have fundamentally changed our cost structure quality efficiency returns culture and emphatically our talent bench this is today a very different company well maintain strong free cash flow and liquidity we dedicate our every effort to delever the balance sheet and do so permanently we are positioning weatherford with selected markets and clients using our product line strengths and specific technological leadership in this time of great transactional turbulence in our industry we have remained an island of calm and internal efficiency focus our operating and management capabilities are immeasurably stronger than they historically were lastly we have a worldwide infrastructure of service support second to none except for a few marginal locations internationally we have kept the international infrastructure intact we are confident of our technological strength product line breadth and market potential for organic growth our numbers will prove out the merits of our direction in this brutal down cycle and even more so when the market turns we believe this is what will deliver the highest shareholder returns at the lowest risk with that ill return the call to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator your first question is from bill herbert of simmons  company your line is open william herbert  simmons  co international thank you good morning bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning bill william herbert  simmons  co international krishna could we discuss zubair a bit here because it seems like the range of outcomes there are reasonably wide in terms of order of magnitude on impact on free cash flow possibilities for  so can you discuss that with a little bit more detail because you talked about revising the free cash flow forecast down to  million but in the event that zubair doesnt swing your way that could be too high by a couple hundred million dollars if i understood you correctly so can you shed some light on that please krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes bill first of all i said that the free cash flow forecast for the year is going to be revised down by  million  william herbert  simmons  co international right krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president – down to about  million right william herbert  simmons  co international right krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president now included in that  million is an assumption that we will successfully negotiate a settlement of our variation order claims on our customer that settlement is being discussed right now and we have not reached a point where we can mutually agree to the settlement if we dont reach a settlement we will not get any more cash even against the milestone payments that are due to us contractually because we believe our customer will withhold all cash going forward if that happens then about  million to  million of cash that could otherwise have come to us including the settlement estimate will not come to us anymore so which means basically the  million of free cash flow will then reduce by  million  million right thats what i was talking about now in fact were getting closer to a settlement agreement with our customer and if we maybe if everything works out be able to announce a settlement in the next several weeks if that happens then the  million remains intact william herbert  simmons  co international so you believe it is likely you will reach a favorable settlement on this front krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think both sides are not too far apart right now and so i think it is – i would give it more than  chance that we will reach a settlement yes william herbert  simmons  co international and so what exactly – yeah what exactly is being disputed here krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president its a level of compensation for the change orders we have a number of change orders that we have documented over the last three years which are changes to the original design of the facility that was in the tender and none of those change orders have been compensated for so we have a certain claim and that claim has not been honored or recognized by our customer so thats basically the subject matter of the discussion william herbert  simmons  co international okay switching gears for a second from the balance sheet bernard in the event that international revenues as a whole continue to bleed lower over the course of the year what then is the likely roadmap for margins given the interplay between pricing concessions on the one hand and those continuing to roll through and on the other hand the more aggressive costcutting that you continue to implement bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer well just to put things in perspective as i mentioned a lot of the cost cuts have not impacted much yet but they will following q the international operations and more specifically the eastern hemisphere which takes the longest from a regulatory standpoint to be able to absorb the layoffs and so forth we have approximately – going through all the cost cuts through q – we have approximately  million a quarter more of cost cuts that are going to come through the eastern hemisphere and also latin america but that is actually – but a lot of it is going to come through the eastern hemisphere that is quite a cushion on further erosion coming from volumes and pricing the second thing also bill is that when we talk about product sales that is one we have some visibility on we have a notion of what is going to be delivered or expected to be delivered in a number of different products and that gives us also a sense of volume and margins to come the services more i think – i think are vulnerable in the event the project gets further canceled and so forth respect to pricing we also have in a sense what was given in our particular case pricing concessions have been given there is no significant amounts of other pricing concessions being negotiated for us ill also point out to you that there are very large tender activities which are ongoing which have been very recent which suggests that many of our clients all the sudden are very interested in locking in volumes at current pricing which suggests also that volume is unlikely to go down further more likely to inch up some all this would tell you that the cost reductions are sizable the product line deliveries are relatively predictable pricing concessions we have already quite a bit have gone through q and q here now there isnt much that we know of analytically to go through incrementally in q all of this to say that the road map for international in q q q should be depending on your viewpoint on the macro either constructive or better than constructive in our particular case william herbert  simmons  co international okay thank you very much bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you bill operator your next question comes from the line of ole slorer of morgan stanley your line is open ole h slorer  morgan stanley  co llc thanks a lot and thanks for a sro rundown here or how you see the world so just to clarify you say that a similar quarter in the second quarter to what you delivered in the first quarter – do you mean at the eps level or at the normalized level the ebitda level bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer yes well actually the ebitda and the eps level the ebitda may be a little bit higher but not materially but netnet at the net income level the eps level similar made up of deteriorating north america further if it was possible latin america a little bit lower and eastern hemisphere a little bit higher on the top line but operating income the biggest moving part for us simply because of product mix in q versus q you add the pieces together it suggests to us that we would have q or q flat at the earnings level albeit the revenues may come down some when all these are added up together ole h slorer  morgan stanley  co llc and if i think about the normalized free cash flow loss in the first quarter as  million and if it excludes zubair on the second quarter what would a reasonable range be to bracket the second quarter free cash flow excluding zubair bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah lets put zubair on the side because it is a onetime event and so for claritys sake without zubair our free cash flow in q should be  million to  million – something like that – excluding zubair thats net of whatever severance would be still occurring which would be less than in q but some still ole h slorer  morgan stanley  co llc understood and just finally at your macro statement you highlighted the declines is it anything particularly that you see around the world which makes you more confident that we are closer to this inflection point in any particular region or anything else that you see bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer i would say that one of the benefits of having a fabulous team around me at weatherford today is i tend to have more time to do what i think might be useful at this juncture and what is more useful i think at this juncture is try to interact as much as i can with the client base and thats a longterm process what does that have to do with your question i have then a multiplicity of verbal qualitative but meaningful nonetheless data points from the continental europe from russia from latin america from pockets of the middle east and i know full well whats going on in the deepwater plays which are longer to have an effect – so ignoring the latter just all the commentary on the particular regions im describing i add them together – it doesnt take a great modeling capability to see a frightening amount of volume being lost permanently and it doesnt have to be spectacular individually –   being lost over a period of a few quarters and accelerating but you add them all together and the picture is – for us actually is as much as we recompute our numbers all the time because we have a hard time believing it the picture is one of a shrinking supply base which we do not see any available capacity which is there to be able to replace it certainly not on call and i mean on call within a year or two its qualitative but its multifaceted many many client interactions particularly in more relaxed atmosphere after meetings take place ole h slorer  morgan stanley  co llc well thanks for that bernard i look forward to discussing that with you in more detail at a later stage ill hand it back bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator your next question is from jim wicklund of credit suisse your line is open james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning guys bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning jim james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker just as a quick followup to bills how much – will you lose any cash in zubair in q bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer so it depends on – jim it depends on whether you assume we strike a settlement or not if we do not strike  james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay if you do strike a settlement will the cash actually hit in the second quarter is that what youre saying bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah so thats part of the settlement discussion so we dont know where thats going to end up but assuming that no settlement takes place at all right and we go to arbitration then yes we will have a cash outflow in april and may james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker well i understand getting paid back for change orders im just trying to figure out how much the operating loss – cash loss would be bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah theyre intertwined so operating cash loss was about  million to  million a month and we will have two months of operations  james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thats helpful bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer – in the second quarter thats the worstcase scenario james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thats what i was looking for okay thanks bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer and jim if that is the case the operation would come to an end anyway at the end of this month james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker there are several of us who are looking forward to zubair being over almost as much as you are bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer its not possible its not possible james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker almost almost youd be amazed capex youve dropped capex by plus since  i understand theres overcapacity your rental business is not doing fabulous and thats i guess historically been a big eater of capex how much do you jeopardize the future how much are you going to have to ramp up in  i mean are we sacrificing  bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer yeah ill give the beginning of an answer and then krishna will do the second half if you take capex and you break it down into three different places of application – so you talk about the infrastructure which is all the bases around the world you talk about supply chain and you talk about the tools the service tools – generally service tool being applicable to whether its a completion service tool whether its an lwd kit et cetera okay i would have to say that the supply chain as it now stands can accommodate easily easily three times the volume we have and thats actually almost a silly statement because we have no – we have plenty of machining and roof line and so forth so were rationalizing it right now it is not a source of capex requirement until and unless the industry is materially different and im talking a level of volume that you do not expect anytime soon talking about years so that one is just not a consumer capex james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer then we get into the infrastructure we rationalize north america we did take down a number of facilities not too many internationally we now have in  countries by my latest count the sort of base representation we feel is desirable given our longterm presence et cetera and i would have to say that the infrastructure can accommodate more than two times the volume that we are running through the company today easily that again is not an area of capex i will remind you that we built this infrastructure ourselves it was a big user of capex in years past then you get to the tool side the service tool side well we do have – take a look at our inventory take a look at our ppe depending on what kind of tool it will be in one or the other category by our assessment also we have largely available somewhere between – tool components that can accommodate  to twice the size of volume we have right thats a lot of numbers that suggest were not starving the business were very careful how we do it were not sort of holding our breath waiting for better times we have far more ppe and equipment capabilities than people realize which is in a way sanctioning an overspending of the past which none of can be proud of least of all myself but it is an assessment today you should not presume were starving do you want to add krishna to that krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes i think that then when you look at  and  we can certainly spend very low levels of capex while still maintaining a healthy growth potential and then from  onwards i would suggest that as a percentage of revenue we will stay at between  to  of revenue for the next two or three years so this is quite low compared to historical levels but its wellexplained by bernard we have plenty of capacity james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay and my followup if i could latin america what and where gets better first bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer thats a good question i would say that my guess – its a guess – is colombia primarily because its so devastated and its heavily a land market you know that and although its  heavily a land market its so eviscerated they dont have the kind of political upheaval you have here in brazil argentina has remained healthy i cant imagine venezuela because they are so financially lets say strained that leaves mexico but mexico is still going through a lot of the restructuring of the industry and so forth and so on so by process of elimination i have to say colombia is your best bet james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay thanks gentlemen appreciate it and thanks for the detail bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you jim operator your next question comes from the line of rob mackenzie of iberia capital your line is open rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc thanks guys bernard a couple questions for you if i may first are you guys seeing any signs of pickup say in the us in any kind of completions or workover activity for you guys and secondly as part of your conversations with your customers that you talked about earlier how have those changed if you will over the past week two weeks month two months are we seeing a turn in sentiment there bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer okay on the first one im sorry to say that no there isnt any signs of a pickup or anything else like that as of today in the us – ie i think the us its really a question of cash flow for our clients and thats price of oil and its also financing capabilities this is one thing the second is interesting question its very simple im getting a lot of questions on what i am seeing in terms of production rate difficulties with other reservoirs and other plays from particular clients wanting to know how the other ones are doing what do i see in terms of trends its sort of interesting that they want to compare their own difficulties on and around decline rates with other difficulties not so much for competitive reasons but to get a sense what is happening to the industry theres been a real lot – these are informal conversations they are outside of the realm of formal meetings which take place also with clients and i think for me are far more valuable than the formal aspects so its a lot of conversations systematically really from what am i seeing in other parts of the world one of the advantages of being an oilfield service person from an oil and gas perspective is you get to see lots of reservoirs and lots of reservoir situations actually more so than the people exploiting it who are constrained or restricted to the ones theyre developing you have a rich sort of pool of information as if you will a traveling salesman as it were rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc great thank you but in terms of what theyre indicating to you – i understand that theyre pumping you for information but what are they indicating to you if anything about how their plans are evolving bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer they are sort of – in general they have no authority or capital or plans for additional drilling and theyre trying to hold off decline rates and they are in many cases its coming to the point where they cannot do that anymore and so it creates a lot of strain and worries and theyre quite anxious to know where and when cash flow will allow them to restart activity because theyre very afraid of losing production rather rapidly now there is an acceleration you hold it off and ultimately there is acceleration rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc great bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer so theres really a sense of – were at the point now where they are afraid of declines that they cannot hold off hence their interest in understanding where and when the industry could have a turn because theyre sort of worried about their own production profile given the fact theyre running out of – through intervention and the sorts of things you can do with a limited budget very very scarce drilling theyre worried about being able to hold off the decline rates where they are without them accelerating further rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc thats very helpful thank you bernard j durocdanner  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator you have no further questions at this time krishna shivram  chief financial officer  executive vice president then well conclude the call thank you very much operator ladies
