 one of the most important things any new author or speaker must do  comment share tweet print email if you have something to say or sell whether that be through a book speaking or releasing a product… there is something you must do if you want to build an audience or achieve any level of significant impact it’s to define your unique value proposition and differentiate yourself from everyone else in other words you have to figure out what makes you unique… what will help you stand out posted on saturday october   how to lead at a higher level  comment share tweet print email as bill taylor said so well in his harvard business review article… the best leaders are insatiable learners to lead at a higher level you must be willing to learn and grow that’s why i’m excited to share a unique opportunity for you to take part in the higher level leader summit free online during this online event you can access key leadership insights from  of the most respected leadership and entrepreneurial leadership authorities around posted on monday september   why simply serving others won’t grow your platform  comment share tweet print email just serve others create good content provide value give give give do those things do them with consistency and you’ll see your platform explode your list will grow and you’ll significantly attract more readers followers and customers that’s basically what you’ve been told right posted on monday august   you don’t need more information – you need more action  comments share tweet print email paralysis by analysis… it’s a condition that holds many of us back i know because i’ve been guilty of it myself maybe you can relate have you ever found yourself wanting to do something… like write a book start a business create a nonprofit or pursue an idea or maybe you follow others who have done it and you find yourself wishing you could emulate their success posted on thursday august   authors why book giveaway promotions may hurt your sales  comments share tweet print email one of the things many authors do when launching their book is to run a “giveaway” promotion on their blog social media or on other blogs etc but that strategy could actually hurt your sales and here’s why… in most cases a book giveaway promotion requires people to register comment or engage in some way to win here comes the problem… posted on

decker search book marketing influence leadership marketing perspective productivity publishing resources social media tag archives product launch posted on wednesday may   what’s your value proposition  comments share tweet print email when i am working with clients who have a product or service they are trying to sell i always begin with two questions…  what’s your value proposition  is your value proposition clearly stated and easily understood the answers are critical to the long term success and sustainability of a business the value proposition is what’s in it for the potential customer… it’s the value that you are proposing they will get think about it this way… what need are you fulfilling what solution are you offering what pain are you relieving what are you giving them in exchange for their money andor time and is it worth it to them for the exchange and… how can you state that in a clear simple succinct way that will get their attention immediately it plays off an understanding of the wiifm factor – what’s in it for me but here’s one of the most important parts… you are not your customer many times our own curse of knowledge can get in the way of being able to see or understand what our real value proposition is or should be in relationship to who we are trying to sell too it’s hard but necessary to step out of our own shoes and into theirs “theirs” being our potential customers you must remove any emotional attachment that you might have because it’s your baby and see it through the eyes of someone new as i watched this intriguing “web tips” video with chris brogan and derek halpern of social triggers i was reminded yet again of the significance of the value proposition especially when you are trying to convert online visitors into online buyers or members… but the principles hold true regardless of what action you are trying to get someone to take even if you are simply trying to build a following and get more blog or rss subscribers… go watch the video and you’ll see what i mean do yourself a favor and spend some time with your offerings and see if the value proposition is there and if it’s clear enough and compelling enough to elicit a response one thing is for sure… if it’s not you’ll know because you won’t be getting the return on your investment like you had hoped but that can be turned around if your value proposition becomes your emphasis thoughts comments get updates tools  resources by email email address first name about mei am the president of higher level group where we work primarily with authors
