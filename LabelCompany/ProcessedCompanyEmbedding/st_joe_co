to port st joe florida in  hoping to take advantage of increased shipping trade through the panama canal however when the great depression hit business dropped off significantly du pont purchased the struggling railroad and made plans to use the infrastructure to build a paper mill leading to the foundation of the st joe company du pont drew up elaborate plans for the development of his mill town

plantation as part of the deal the company continued using the land for an additional five years during which it contracted the land to florida crystals and other sugar growers in order to utilize some portions of the talisman property which were not contiguous land swaps with other sugar growers were necessary some of st joes most profitable deals came from selling conservation land to the

headquartered in jacksonville florida united states and is floridas second largest private landowner owning about  acres in the state as of november  contents  beginning  talisman sugar corporation  florida east coast industries  post ball era  bay county  references  external links beginningedit the company was founded in  as part of the alfred i du pont testamentary trust by du ponts brotherinlaw edward ball prior to its establishment the trust had already begun land purchases making its first one in  during the land booms in south florida the company acquired stillcheap land in the florida panhandle in  du ponts purchased the apalachicola northern railroad apalachicola northern had extended its network from chattahoochee to port st joe florida in  hoping to take advantage of increased shipping trade through the panama canal however when the great depression hit business dropped off significantly du pont purchased the struggling railroad and made plans to use the infrastructure to build a paper mill leading to the foundation of the st joe company du pont drew up elaborate plans for the development of his mill town as the model city of the south but died before it could be completed his brotherinlaw ed ball took control of the st joe company in  but never acted on the master city plan construction began in  and from  to  the company operated a paper mill at port st joe as st joe paper company land purchases continued throughout the s and s often for mere dollars an acre and st joe eventually owned more than one million acres  km² the company invigorated the local economy following the depression employing thousands at its paper mill but wreaked havoc on the environment the mill released sulfurous exhaust from sulfate pulping and dioxins an unintended toxin generated by the chlorine bleaching process used to make white pulp by the s the company was drawing  million gallons of water a day from the floridan aquifer seriously depleting the water table st joe paper also clearcut millions of acres of old growth forest engaging in silviculture to replant the areas with slash pine the practice decimated the native longleaf pine stands reducing the species to  percent of its former range because of this the united states department of the interior designated parts of the region a critically endangered ecosystem the paper mill was most profitable in the s with products being directly marketed to companyowned box plants however an extended period of down time months due to market conditions in  signaled the beginning of the end for the mill after nearly sixty years st joe decided to get out of the paper business the mill was sold in  to florida coast paper for  million and was able to operate and produce paper until the decline of the container board market the mill closed august   and did not reopen the mill was gone by  after the dismantling of the paper mill the st joe company was back in town in  to unveil a  million plan for the former mill site that was similar to alfred du ponts idealized southern town – an integrated city with upscale residential districts entertainment venues a thriving port and a diverse economy the company made a deal with the state of florida to reroute us  inland to permit development of beachfront property talisman sugar corporationedit st joe acquired the talisman sugar company in  which included almost  acres  km in palm beach and hendry counties in the everglades st joe received negative publicity for their south florida sugar cane business from labor unions and environmental groups including by cesar chavez of the united farm workers additionally pressures over environmental damage led the company to strike a deal with the federal government and state of florida to sell its sugar business as part of an everglades restoration project florida paid  million in  to st joe co for the acre  km talisman sugar plantation as part of the deal the company continued using the land for an additional five years during which it contracted the land to florida crystals and other sugar growers in order to utilize some portions of the talisman property which were not contiguous land swaps with other sugar growers were necessary some of st joes most profitable deals came from selling conservation land to the state a total of some  acres  km² were purchased by the state for  million that works out to an average of over  per acre—not a bad return on land that according to the company website was often purchased for mere dollars an acre florida east coast industriesedit ball acquired a controlling interest in florida east coast railroad for the alfred i dupont testamentary trust in  which allowed the railroad to finally emerge from bankruptcy on october   joe spun off to its shareholders the  equity interest in feci through the distribution of feci class b common shares post ball eraedit following balls death in  the company began to sell off its industrial operations and focus on land development as a developer st joe has distinguished itself as catering to more wellheeled clientele but has also established a reputation as more environmentally friendly than the company under ball pete rummell formerly chairman of walt disney imagineering was hired in  to lead their real estate business and became chairman and ceo st joe built a  sq ft  m corporate headquarters on the st johns river in downtown jacksonville in  at the groundbreaking rummell said this is an important milestone for us we dont get a lot of revenue from the city of jacksonville but its important to who we are and what we are the company subsequently moved its headquarters to watersound florida the company operates through four segments residential real estate develops largescale mixeduse resort seasonal and primary residential communities as well as selling housing units and home sites to retail customers and builders commercial real estate develops and sells commercial properties including retail properties multifamily parcels office parks and commerce parks rural land sales markets parcels for various rural residential and recreational uses in northwest florida it sells parcels of undeveloped land and developed home sites within rural settings forestry grows harvests and sells timber and wood fiber its products primarily include pine pulpwood timber and cypress products since the national downturn in the real estate market in the mids the companys sales suffered with earnings dropping off by  percent in  as a result the company cut its workforce exited the homebuilding market and sold its office holdings which included the corporate headquarters built in  in the late s st joe began to sell timber land in rural areas after deciding to focus on community and commercial development rummell departed in august  and was replaced by hugh durden as chairman of the board durden was also chairman of the alfred i dupont testamentary trust since  in december  the company acknowledged selling two large developments at a loss which they characterized as nonstrategic the transactions were intended to take advantage of federal tax rules on losses from the sale of assets on march   the company announced plans to relocate their corporate headquarters to a site near the northwest florida beaches international airport when their current lease expires in  most of the company’s land is located in the panhandle and their success depends on development there at the end of february  st joe announced that britt greene had resigned as ceo and president of the company the companys largest shareholder fairholme disagreed with managements asset development plans and sought to replace certain board members greene and three other members will announce their resignation from the board within a few days two members from fairholme and former florida governor charlie crist will replace them bay countyedit the company began marketing the panhandle region as floridas great northwest and was the major force behind plans to relocate and dramatically expand panama citybay county international airport in the hope that a larger airport would attract wealthier home buyers st joe owns about  acres  km of land in the area surrounding the new airport site and has announced plans to build  homes and  square feet  m of commercial space the company has also offered to donate about  acres  km² for preservation the project attracted quite a bit of opposition including taxpayer and environmental groups who pointed out that the current airport was operating at only half its capacity—with  outbound flights a day— and argues that the new facility would primarily benefit one developer at taxpayer expense the new airport was approved and construction began in  on  acres  km donated by st joe the northwest florida beaches international airport opened on may   northwest of panama city since construction the new airport has seen much heavier use than the old one for example in the year ending june   the airport had  aircraft operations average  per day  general aviation  military  airline and  air taxi  aircraft were then based at this airport

helena chemical company resources publications case studies completed transactions press has been acquired by allied acted as exclusive financial advisor to st joseph agri services in this transaction helena chemical company acquires st joseph agri services november              client objective donnie miller and steve pierce spent  years running st joseph agri services a company that provides a wide range of agricultural products to farming operations throughout northwest missouri miller and pierce established a loyal customer base in the region by consistently providing dependable service and quality products miller primarily handled the companys financial management responsibilities while pierce oversaw the production and mixing of fertilizer products and equipment maintenance in addition to their ownership responsibilities both owners were heavily involved with various community organizations such as the local future farmers of america chapter and h club the buchanan county agribusiness expo center and the countys university of missouri extension council by  miller and pierce were ready to focus more on their roles within the community although they wanted to stay actively involved in st joe ag they felt that a new owner could share some of the daily management responsibilities and provide financial resources to help the company grow solution miller and pierce sought the help of allied business group to find a suitable buyer for the company after hearing about our firms knowledge of the agriculture industry our team had recently sold a seed producer and distributor based in the midwest and had performed valuations for several agricultural product companies in the past from this experience we had a keen understanding of the industry as well as an

fertilizers has more than  sales locations across the country and wanted to add a strategic location in the region miller and pierce ultimately sold the company to helena because the new owners could provide resources to help st joe ag expand its customer base and product offering additionally helena planned to retain all of the companys employees and would allow miller and pierce to remain actively involved in it with helenas leadership and financial resources miller and pierce could help ensure a smooth transition for their company while focusing more on their work within the community
