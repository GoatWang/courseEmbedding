infomcraecapitalcom find us on facebook follow us on linkedin menu our services – divorce divorce is a difficult stressful and financially draining experience during the process most of the effort involves determining how to split up marital assets with the goal to get as much as possible  but not all assets are the same some assets are easier to convert to cash than others  many assets have different tax implications for the account holder  moreover after the divorce is complete many clients are confronted with the task of managing these assets  mcrae capital management has decades of experience working with clients who have experienced the stress of divorce evaluating assets during the divorce process one of the most important parts of a divorce settlement is to identify what kinds of assets one might receive  cash and marketable securities are much more liquid than real estate and other hard assets  if a settlement includes large portions of a retirement account such as an ira or company k the recipient needs to consider possible taxes and penalties incurred to access the cash  mcrae capital management can help you evaluate your marital assets before your settlement distribution to ensure you understand the ramifications of the assets you receive qualfied domestic relations order qdro a qdro is a legal order that establishes an exspouse’s right to a qualified retirement plan or pension the qdro also allows the exspouse to withdraw assets from the plan and roll them into them into an account in their own name  mcrae capital management can help explain the ramifications of a qdro and help transfer those assets into your own account college planning after a divorce college planning for your children can become more difficult  often there are two separate parties that have some responsibility to funding future education for your children  mcrae can help analyze your new situation and recommend strategies to help with the college planning process budgeting often after a divorce we feel like we are starting all over again and it can be a daunting task  past financial plans need to be reconstructed for a life that we hadn’t planned for  it is important to take small steps as we need to learn to feel comfortable with our new life  the best place to start is with a simple budget and mcrae capital management can help some items we deal with every week such as food fuel and clothing some items occur on a monthly basis such as mortgage rent utilities and auto payments  yet some other items occur quarterly or annually like taxes insurance and health care costs  mcrae can help you set up a budget in place that will take into account all of these costs and see how they compare with your assets and the income they can generate share this

havesomeone to trust call us   infomcraecapitalcom find us on facebook follow us on linkedin menu our services – college planning with the cost of higher education spiraling out of control planning for college is one of the most difficult aspects of financial planning  it is difficult for three reasons  first it is a daunting task because the cost are so high and constantly climbing second there seem to be an endless number of different types of accounts  scholarship opportunities tax and gift considerations and loans options that make the process extremely complex and difficult to understand  third  all the rules and associated strategies keep changing so a strategy that may make sense at one point may not in the future  between new parents who have just started a family clients with children who are approaching college age and grandparents who want to help the younger generation we probably get more questions about college planning than anything else setting up accounts to save for college there are many strategies for saving money for college and each has a different impact with respect to taxes possible financial aid and scholarships trust accounts  plans roth iras student personal accounts parents personal accounts are a few of the ways to pay for college  it is important to recognize that every situation is unique  mcrae capital management advisors can help set up the right accounts for your specific situation where to save for college  different accounts are treated differently in the fasfa process for demonstrated need for financial aid  funds titled directly in the students name are viewed differently than assets in a  account or a parents account  let a mcrae advisor help organize your assets in the best way possible for your student and family paying for college when the student matriculates  saving money for college is only part of the game  based on your unique situation how you actually pay the bill when your student starts school can have tax and financial aid ramifications  how you pay for senior year may be completely different from freshman year  it may make sense to take loans for the early years and use gifted funds for the later years  consult a mcrae advisor to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of how the bills are actually paid the rules change as we pointed out above it seems the rules and strategies change rapidly  the escalating costs of college and the mound of student debt the public is accumulating is daily news  there is a lot of pressure to address these issues and we expect to see new rules and options over the years  speak with a mcrae advisor to stay current with college investment strategies that are current share this   mcrae capital management  read our disclaimer  to download
