of games for every platform so we’ll go wherever the gamers go i think nintendo switch will put nintendo at the forefront of the game industry once again their approach is quite different from anything they’ve done in the past – they’ve listened to ea activision and other companies since the beginning of the switch’s development so we’ve been involved throughout the whole process they teamed up with us because they wanted to guarantee the console would be successful doing business with nintendo is very important for us… we’d like to bring more and more games over for everyone” said

anonymous askedi understand your positive view of dlc and the forprofit models it would be insane to argue that the people who make the games we love dont deserve to be paid for making them im interested to have you go deeper into the financials of dlciapfreemium content when as an outsider it seems like it doesnt add up when i read things like clash of clans makes mil a day or cod setting another record i want to feel the billion dollars is being reinvested into the game and not  ferraristhe first thing to note is that the sales figures are always always divided up into chunks there are always people who are standing by to take their cut from the revenue and there are a lot of other costs associated with the game that need to be paid for up front one thing is for sure  dlc is designed to be much more efficient than any initial development which is why it’s so lucrative and publishers are pushing harder on it let’s take fifa as an example since i’m actually more familiar with aaa development than the socialmobile arena ea makes a lot of money from fifa’s ultimate team modeminigame  to the tune of approximately  million in revenue for fifa  that’s a lot of packs being bought so let’s begin breaking this down of every sale goes to microsoft nintendo apple google andor even a different division of eathis includes all money via retail digital copies and so on even for pc titles if it’s distributed in some way like ea does with origin that money has to be counted as origin’s revenue as a cost to fifa this sort of accounting is necessary in order to track origin’s overall continued performance and its justify its continued existence fifa’s developers don’t get any of this cut despite ea being the ultimate owner of both products remember ea’s executives need to allocate and approve budgets for studios and projects so it’s important that they can calculate roughly what the monetary value of the service or product isin exchange for the  of each sale plus some flat fee for “free” things the developers are given a few things in return the platform provides curation online distribution and handling of all financial transactions to a regular and engaged playerbase that numbers in the millions you as a player also get the benefit of the certification process  any dlc you obtain will be guaranteed to work with your hardware to a minimum level of competencesome undisclosed percentage is paid to fifa the organization for the licensei believe the number is around  though i am not certain dlc revenue is not considered separate from the original product for accountingthis includes things like development costs and marketing costs when it comes to accounting everything is calculated in terms of the original project’s profits and losses which makes some amount of sense  the systems tools and skillstraining developed for the game are used for the continued development of the dlc and so the revenue from the dlc should also be considered to help offset that initial cost a significant chunk of the revenue goes to pay for the development and marketing costs you might not realize this but marketing costs a lot some games like call of duty modern warfare  actually spent four times  million as much on marketing as they did on the actual game’s development  million most of the time you’re looking at about a  ratio of dev costs to marketing with development costs on a aaa game usually in the  million ballparkso what do they spend whatever’s left over onthe main thing you’re looking at is different labels since they earn profits and losses individually this means that revenue is distributed on a labelbylabel basis fifa is part of the “ea studios” label which is actually headed up by patrick soderlund and that includes all of bioware ea sports dice visceral and so on the revenues earned by fifa  ultimate team went to pay for the continued development of games that are in development by that label like the new mirror’s edge game bioware’s new ip star wars battlefront  and a bunch of other unannounced games andor canceled games eg dawngate shadow realms but that isn’t all it went to pay for it also gets paid out as bonuses for the employees the team the leadership and so on and stock buybacks to share those profits with the shareholders as well as reinvesting in themselves in good years we get more games green lit and funded as well as better bonuses for employees and profit sharing for shareholders in lean years even big revenues from a few projects are barely enough to cover the development costs of the scant projects still in development remember most games take at least two to three years to come out and many are killed before even being announcedso let’s recap  of that  million revenue is cut from the take immediately going to sony microsoft origin fifa and so on  of what’s left gets taken to pay back marketing and development costs what remains is profit which is used forpaying out bonuses to employeespaying out dividends or profits to shareholdersfunding projectsgames announced and unannounced that are in various stages of developmentthis isn’t to say that some people don’t make enough to buy a bunch of ferraris usually this occurs at the executive level since the executives tend to be the ones who get the largest portion of the compensation and rewards for making the decisions that affect the largest amount of the finances and these sorts of bonuses and compensation can be in the millions however even if they were in the double digit millions on an annual basis a publisher like ea that’s a very small number according to their fiscal  report ea earned  billion in total revenue of which was  million in net income revenue  cost part of that m went into a stock repurchase some of it is going towards bonuses and most of it will go to fund new projectsfurther readinghow do games make a profit askagamedev followunfollowthe business of video gamesgame productioncorporate
