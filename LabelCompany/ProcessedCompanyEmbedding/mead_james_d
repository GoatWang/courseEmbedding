philosophy internet encyclopedia of philosophy search george herbert mead — george herbert mead is a major figure in the history of american philosophy one of the founders of pragmatism along with peirce james tufts and dewey he published numerous papers during his lifetime and following his death several of his students produced four books in his name from meads unpublished and even unfinished notes and manuscripts from students notes and from stenographic records of some of his courses at the university of chicago through his teaching writing and posthumous publications mead has exercised a significant influence in th century social theory among both philosophers and social scientists in particular meads theory of the emergence of mind and self out of the social process of significant communication has become the foundation of the symbolic interactionist school of sociology and social psychology in addition to his well known and widely appreciated social philosophy meads thought includes significant contributions to the philosophy of nature the philosophy of science philosophical anthropology the philosophy of history and process philosophy both john dewey and alfred north whitehead considered mead a thinker of the highest order table of contents life writings social theory communication and mind action self and other the temporal structure of human existence perception and reflection meads theory of perspectives philosophy of history the nature of history history and selfconsciousness history and the idea of the future references and further reading primary sources secondary sources  life george herbert mead was born in south hadley massachusetts on february   and he died in chicago illinois on april   he was the second child of hiram mead d  a congregationalist minister and pastor of the south hadley congregational church and elizabeth storrs billings  george herberts older sister alice was born in  in  the family moved to oberlin ohio where hiram mead became professor of homiletics at the oberlin theological seminary a position he held until his death in  after her husbands death elizabeth storrs billings mead taught for two years at oberlin college and subsequently from  to  served as president of mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts george herbert mead entered oberlin college in  at the age of sixteen and graduated with a ba degree in  while at oberlin mead and his best friend henry northrup castle became enthusiastic students of literature poetry and history and staunch opponents of supernaturalism in literature mead was especially interested in wordsworth shelley carlyle shakespeare keats and milton and in history he concentrated on the writings of macauley buckle and motley mead published an article on charles lamb in the  issue of the oberlin review  upon graduating from oberlin in  mead took a grade school teaching job which however lasted only four months mead was let go because of the way in which he handled discipline problems he would simply dismiss uninterested and disruptive students from his class and send them home from the end of  through the summer of  mead was a surveyor with the wisconsin central rail road company he worked on the project that resulted in the eleven hundred mile railroad line that ran from minneapolis minnesota to moose jaw saskatchewan and which connected there with the canadian pacific railroad line mead earned his ma degree in philosophy at harvard university during the  academic year while majoring in philosophy he also studied psychology greek latin german and french among his philosophy professors were george h palmer  and josiah royce  during this time mead was most influenced by royces romanticism and idealism since mead was later to become one of the major figures in the american pragmatist movement it is interesting that while at harvard he did not study under william james  although he lived in jamess home as tutor to the james children in the summer of  meads friend henry castle and his sister helen had traveled to europe and had settled temporarily in leipzig germany later in the early fall of  mead too went to leipzig in order to pursue a phd degree in philosophy and physiological psychology during the  academic year at the university of leipzig mead became strongly interested in darwinism and studied with wilhelm wundt  and g stanley hall  two major founders of experimental psychology on halls recommendation mead transferred to the university of berlin in the spring of  where he concentrated on the study of physiological psychology and economic theory while mead and his friends the castles were staying in leipzig a romance between mead and helen castle developed and they were subsequently married in berlin on october   prior to george and helens marriage henry castle had married frieda stechner of leipzig and henry and his bride had returned to cambridge massachusetts where henry continued his studies in law at harvard meads work on his phd degree was interrupted in the spring of  by the offer of an instructorship in philosophy and psychology at the university of michigan this was to replace james hayden tufts  who was leaving michigan in order to complete his phd degree at the university of freiburg mead took the job and never thereafter resumed his own phd studies mead worked at the university of michigan from the fall of  through the spring of  he taught both philosophy and psychology at michigan he became acquainted with and influenced by the work of sociologist charles horton cooley  psychologist alfred lloyd and philosopher john dewey  mead and dewey became close personal and intellectual friends finding much common ground in their interests in philosophy and psychology in those days the lines between philosophy and psychology were not sharply drawn and mead was to teach and do research in psychology throughout his career mostly social psychology after  george and helen meads only child henry castle albert mead was born in ann arbor in  when the boy grew up he became a physician and married irene tufts james hayden tufts daughter a psychiatrist in  having completed his phd work at freiburg james hayden tufts received an administrative appointment at the newlycreated university of chicago to help its founding president william rainey harper organize the new university which opened in the fall of  the university of chicago was organized around three main departments semitics chaired by jm powis smith classics chaired by paul shorey and philosophy chaired by john dewey as of  dewey was recommended for that position by tufts and dewey agreed to move from the university of michigan to the university of chicago provided that his friend and colleague george herbert mead was given a position as assistant professor in the chicago philosophy department thus the university of chicago became the new center of american pragmatism which had earlier originated with charles sanders peirce  and william james at harvard the chicago pragmatists were led by tufts dewey and mead dewey left chicago for columbia university in  leaving tufts and mead as the major spokesmen for the pragmatist movement in chicago mead spent the rest of his life in chicago he was assistant professor of philosophy from  associate professor from  and full professor from  until his death in  during those years mead made substantial contributions in both social psychology and philosophy meads major contribution to the field of social psychology was his attempt to show how the human self arises in the process of social interaction especially by way of linguistic communication symbolic interaction in philosophy as already mentioned mead was one of the major american pragmatists as such he pursued and furthered the pragmatist program and developed his own distinctive philosophical outlook centered around the concepts of sociality and temporality see below mrs helen castle mead died on december   george mead was hit hard by her passing and gradually became ill himself john dewey arranged for meads appointment as a professor in the philosophy department at columbia university as of the  academic year but before he could take up that appointment mead died in chicago on april    writings during his morethanyear career mead thought deeply wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in philosophy and psychology however he never published a book after his death several of his students edited four volumes from stenographic records of his social psychology course at the university of chicago from meads lecture notes and from meads numerous unpublished papers the four books are the philosophy of the present

twentyfive of meads most notable published articles have been collected in selected writings george herbert mead edited by andrew j reck bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press  most of meads writings and much of the secondary literature thereon are listed in the references and further reading below  social theory a communication and mind in mind self and society  mead describes how the individual mind and self arises out of the social process instead of approaching human experience in terms of individual psychology mead analyzes experience from the standpoint of communication as essential to the social order individual psychology for mead is intelligible only in terms of social processes the development of the individuals self and of his self consciousness within the field of his experience is preeminently social for mead the social process is prior to the structures and processes of individual experience mind according to mead arises within the social process of communication and cannot be understood apart from that process the communicational process involves two phases  the conversation of gestures and  language or the conversation of significant gestures both phases presuppose a social context within which two or more individuals are in interaction with one another mead introduces the idea of the conversation of gestures with his famous example of the dogfight dogs approaching each other in hostile attitude carry on such a language of gestures they walk around each other growling and snapping and waiting for the opportunity to attack     mind self and society  the act of each dog becomes the stimulus to the other dog for his response there is then a relationship between these two and as the act is responded to by the other dog it in turn undergoes change the very fact that the dog is ready to attack another becomes a stimulus to the other dog to change his own position or his own attitude he has no sooner done this than the change of attitude in the second dog in turn causes the first dog to change his attitude we have here a conversation of gestures they are not however gestures in the sense that they are significant we do not assume that the dog says to himself if the animal comes from this direction he is going to spring at my throat and i will turn in such a way what does take place is an actual change in his own position due to the direction of the approach of the other dog mind self and society  emphasis added in the conversation of gestures communication takes place without an awareness on the part of the individual of the response that her gesture elicits in others and since the individual is unaware of the reactions of others to her gestures she is unable to respond to her own gestures from the standpoint of others the individual participant in the conversation of gestures is communicating but she does not know that she is communicating the conversation of gestures that is is unconscious communication it is however out of the conversation of gestures that language or conscious communication emerges meads theory of communication is evolutionary communication develops from more or less primitive toward more or less advanced forms of social interaction in the human world language supersedes but does not abolish the conversation of gestures and marks the transition from nonsignificant to significant interaction language in meads view is communication through significant symbols a significant symbol is a gesture usually a vocal gesture that calls out in the individual making the gesture the same that is functionally identical response that is called out in others to whom the gesture is directed mind self and society  significant communication may also be defined as the comprehension by the individual of the meaning of her gestures mead describes the communicational process as a social act since it necessarily requires at least two individuals in interaction with one another it is within this act that meaning arises the act of communication has a triadic structure consisting of the following components  an initiating gesture on the part of an individual  a response to that gesture by a second individual and  the result of the action initiated by the first gesture mind self and society   there is no meaning independent of the interactive participation of two or more individuals in the act of communication of course the individual can anticipate the responses of others and can therefore consciously and intentionally make gestures that will bring out appropriate responses in others this form of communication is quite different from that which takes place in the conversation of gestures for in the latter there is no possibility of the conscious structuring and control of the communicational act consciousness of meaning is that which permits the individual to respond to her own gestures as the other responds a gesture then is an action that implies a reaction the reaction is the meaning of the gesture and points toward the result the intentionality of the action initiated by the gesture gestures become significant symbols when they implicitly arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse or are supposed intended to arouse in other individuals the individuals to whom they are addressed mind self and society  for example you ask somebody to bring a visitor a chair you arouse the tendency to get the chair in the other but if he is slow to act you get the chair yourself the response to the gesture is the doing of a certain thing and you arouse that same tendency in yourself mind self and society  at this stage the conversation of gestures is transformed into a conversation of significant symbols there is a certain ambiguity in meads use of the terms meaning and significance the question is can a gesture be meaningful without being significant but if the meaning of a gesture is the response to that gesture then there is meaning in the nonsignificant conversation of gestures — the second dog after all responds to the gestures of the first dog in the dog fight and viceversa however it is the conversation of significant symbols that is the foundation of meads theory of mind only in terms of gestures as significant symbols is the existence of mind or intelligence possible for only in terms of gestures which are significant symbols can thinking — which is simply an internalized or implicit conversation of the individual with himself by means of such gestures — take place mind self and society  mind then is a form of participation in an interpersonal that is social process it is the result of taking the attitudes of others toward ones own gestures or conduct in general mind in brief is the use of significant symbols the essence of meads socalled social behaviorism is his view that mind is an emergent out of the interaction of organic individuals in a social matrix mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure mead therefore rejects the traditional view of the mind as a substance separate from the body as well as the behavioristic attempt to account for mind solely in terms of physiology or neurology mead agrees with the behaviorists that we can explain mind behaviorally if we deny its existence as a substantial entity and view it instead as a natural function of human organisms but it is neither possible nor desirable to deny the existence of mind altogether the physiological organism is a necessary but not sufficient condition of mental behavior mind self and society  without the peculiar character of the human central nervous system internalization by the individual of the process of significant communication would not be possible but without the social process of conversational behavior there would be no significant symbols for the individual to internalize the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that the individual realizes her physiological and neurological potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in meads terms is the individualized focus of the communicational process — it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no mind or thought without language and language the content of mind is only a development and product of social interaction mind self and society   thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is an emergent in the dynamic ongoing social process that constitutes human experience mind self and society  b action for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication meads concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of mind self and society is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment there are two models of the act in meads general philosophy  the model of the actassuch ie organic activity in general which is elaborated in the philosophy of the act and  the model of the social act ie social activity which is a special case of organic activity and which is of particular although not exclusive relevance in the interpretation of human experience the relation between the social process of behavior and the social environment is analogous to the relation between the individual organism and the physicalbiological environment mind self and society  the actassuch in his analysis of the actassuch that is organic activity mead speaks of the act as determining the relation between the individual and the environment the philosophy of the act  reality according to mead is a field of situations these situations are fundamentally characterized by the relation of an organic individual to his environment or world the world things and the individual are what they are because of this relation between the individual and his world the philosophy of the act  it is by way of the act that the relation between the individual and his world is defined and developed mead describes the act as developing in four stages  the stage of impulse upon which the organic individual responds to problematic situations in his experience eg the intrusion of an enemy into the individuals field of existence  the stage of perception upon which the individual defines and analyzes his problem eg the direction of the enemys attack is sensed and a path leading in the opposite direction is selected as an avenue of escape  the stage of manipulation upon which action is taken with reference to the individuals perceptual appraisal of the problematic situation eg the individual runs off along the path and away from his enemy and  the stage of consummation upon which the encountered difficulty is resolved and the continuity of organic existence re established eg the individual escapes his enemy and returns to his ordinary affairs the philosophy of the act   what is of interest in this description is that the individual is not merely a passive recipient of external environmental influences but is capable of taking action with reference to such influences he reconstructs his relation to his environment through selective perception and through the use or manipulation of the objects selected in perception eg the path of escape mentioned above the objects in the environment are so to speak created through the activity of the organic individual the path along which the individual escapes was not there in his thoughts or perceptions until the individual needed a path of escape reality is not simply out there independent of the organic individual but is the outcome of the dynamic interrelation of organism and environment perception according to mead is a relation between organism and object perception is not then something that occurs in the organism but is an objective relation between the organism and its environment and the perceptual object is not an entity out there independent of the organism but is one pole of the interactive perceptual process the philosophy of the act  objects of perception arise within the individuals attempt to solve problems that have emerged in his experience problems that are in an important sense determined by the individual himself the character of the individuals environment is predetermined by the individuals sensory capacities the environment then is what it is in relation to a sensuous and selective organic individual and things or objects are what they are in the relationship between the individual and his environment and this relationship is that of conduct ie action the philosophy of the act  the social act while the social act is analogous to the actassuch the abovedescribed model of individual biological activity mind self and society  will not suffice as an analysis of social experience the social organism is not an organic individual but a social group of individual organisms mind self and society  the human individual then is a member of a social organism and his acts must be viewed in the context of social acts that involve other individuals society is not a collection of preexisting atomic individuals as suggested for example by hobbes locke and rousseau but rather a processual whole within which individuals define themselves through participation in social acts the acts of the individual are according to mead aspects of acts that are trans individual for social psychology the whole society is prior to the part the individual not the part to the whole and the part is explained in terms of the whole not the whole in terms of the part or parts mind self and society  thus the social act is a dynamic whole a complex organic process within which the individual is situated and it is within this situation that individual acts are possible and have meaning mead defines the social act in relation to the social object the social act is a collective act involving the participation of two or more individuals and the social object is a collective object having a common meaning for each participant in the act there are many kinds of social acts some very simple some very complex these range from the relatively simple interaction of two individuals eg in dancing in lovemaking or in a game of handball to rather more complex acts involving more than two individuals eg a play a religious ritual a hunting expedition to still more complex acts carried on in the form of social organizations and institutions eg law enforcement education economic exchange the life of a society consists in the aggregate of such social acts it is by way of the social act that persons in society create their reality the objects of the social world common objects such as clothes furniture tools as well as scientific objects such as atoms and electrons are what they are as a result of being defined and utilized within the matrix of specific social acts thus an animal skin becomes a coat in the experience of people eg barbarians or pretenders to aristocracy engaged in the social act of covering andor adorning their bodies and the electron is introduced as a hypothetical object in the scientific communitys project of investigating the ultimate nature of physical reality communication through significant symbols is that which renders the intelligent organization of social acts possible significant communication as stated earlier involves the comprehension of meaning ie the taking of the attitude of others toward ones own gestures significant communication among individuals creates a world of common symbolic meanings within which further and deliberate social acts are possible the specifically human social act in other words is rooted in the act of significant communication and is in fact ordered by the conversation of significant symbols in addition to its role in the organization of the social act significant communication is also fundamentally involved in the creation of social objects for it is by way of significant symbols that humans indicate to one another the object relevant to their collective acts for example suppose that a group of people has decided on a trip to the zoo one of the group offers to drive the others in his car and the others respond by following the driver to his vehicle the car has thus become an object for all members of the group and they all make use of it to get to the zoo prior to this particular project of going to the zoo the car did not have the specific significance that it takes on in becoming instrumental in the zootrip the car was no doubt an object in some other social act prior to its incorporation into the zootrip but prior to that incorporation it was not specifically and explicitly a means of transportation to the zoo whatever it was however would be determined by its role in some social act eg the owners project of getting to work each day etc it is perhaps needless to point out that the decision to go to the zoo as well as the decision to use the car in question as a means of transportation was made through a conversation involving significant symbols the significant symbol functions here to indicate some object or other within the field of social behavior an object of common interest to all the individuals involved in the given social act thus directed toward or upon that object mind self and society  the reality that humans experience is for mead very largely socially constructed in a process mediated and facilitated by the use of significant symbols c self and other the self as social emergent the self like the mind is a social emergent this social conception of the self mead argues entails that individual selves are the products of social interaction and not the logical or biological preconditions of that interaction mead contrasts his social theory of the self with individualistic theories of the self that is theories that presuppose the priority of selves to social process the self is something which has a development it is not initially there at birth but arises in the process of social experience and activity that is develops in the given individual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole and to other individuals within that process mind self and society  meads model of society is an organic model in which individuals are related to the social process as bodily parts are related to bodies the self is a reflective process — ie it is an object to itself for mead it is the reflexivity of the self that distinguishes it from other objects and from the body for the body and other objects are not objects to themselves as the self is it is perfectly true that the eye can see the foot but it does not see the body as a whole we cannot see our backs we can feel certain portions of them if we are agile but we cannot get an experience of our whole body there are of course experiences which are somewhat vague and difficult of location but the bodily experiences are for us organized about a self the foot and hand belong to the self we can see our feet especially if we look at them from the wrong end of an opera glass as strange things which we have difficulty in recognizing as our own the parts of the body are quite distinguishable from the self we can lose parts of the body without any serious invasion of the self the mere ability to experience different parts of the body is not different from the experience of a table the table presents a different feel from what the hand does when one hand feels another but it is an experience of something with which we come definitely into contact the body does not experience itself as a whole in the sense in which the self in some way enters into the experience of the self mind self and society  it is moreover this reflexivity of the self that distinguishes human from animal consciousness mind self and society fn  mead points out two uses of the term consciousness  consciousness may denote a certain feeling consciousness which is the outcome of an organisms sensitivity to its environment in this sense animals in so far as they act with reference to events in their environments are conscious and  consciousness may refer to a form of awareness which always has implicitly at least the reference to an i in it that is the term consciousness may mean self consciousness mind self and society  it is the second use of the term consciousness that is appropriate to the discussion of human consciousness while there is a form of prereflective consciousness that refers to the bare thereness of the world it is reflective or self consciousness that characterizes human awareness the prereflective world is a world in which the self is absent mind self and society  selfconsciousness then involves the objectification of the self in the mode of self consciousness the individual enters as such into his own experience    as an object mind self and society  how is this objectification of the self possible the individual according to mead can enter as an object to himself only on the basis of social relations and interactions only by means of his experiential transactions with other individuals in an organized social environment mind self and society  selfconsciousness is the result of a process in which the individual takes the attitudes of others toward herself in which she attempts to view herself from the standpoint of others the selfasobject arises out of the individuals experience of other selves outside of herself the objectified self is an emergent within the social structures and processes of human intersubjectivity symbolic interaction and the emergence of the self meads account of the social emergence of the self is developed further through an elucidation of three forms of intersubjective activity language play and the game these forms of symbolic interaction that is social interactions that take place via shared symbols such as words definitions roles gestures rituals etc are the major paradigms in meads theory of socialization and are the basic social processes that render the reflexive objectification of the self possible language as we have seen is communication via significant symbols and it is through significant communication that the individual is able to take the attitudes of others toward herself language is not only a necessary mechanism of mind but also the primary social foundation of the self i know of no other form of behavior than the linguistic in which the individual is an object to himself    mind self and society  when a self does appear it always involves an experience of another there could not be an experience of a self simply by itself the plant or the lower animal reacts to its environment but there is no experience of a self     when the response of the other becomes an essential part in the experience or conduct of the individual when taking the attitude of the other becomes an essential part in his behavior — then the individual appears in his own experience as a self and until this happens he does not appear as a self mind self and society  within the linguistic act the individual takes the role of the other ie responds to her own gestures in terms of the symbolized attitudes of others this process of taking the role of the other within the process of symbolic interaction is the primal form of selfobjectification and is essential to self realization mind self and society  it ought to be clear then that the selfasobject of which mead speaks is not an object in a mechanistic billiard ball world of external relations but rather it is a basic structure of human experience that arises in response to other persons in an organic socialsymbolic world of internal and inter subjective relations this becomes even clearer in meads interpretation of playing and gaming in playing and gaming as in linguistic activity the key to the generation of selfconsciousness is the process of roleplaying in play the child takes the role of another and acts as though she were the other eg mother doctor nurse indian and countless other symbolized roles this form of roleplaying involves a single role at a time thus the other which comes into the childs experience in play is a specific other the philosophy of the present  the game involves a more complex form of roleplaying than that involved in play in the game the individual is required to internalize not merely the character of a single and specific other but the roles of all others who are involved with him in the game he must moreover comprehend the rules of the game which condition the various roles mind self and society  this configuration of rolesorganizedaccordingto rules brings the attitudes of all participants together to form a symbolized unity this unity is the generalized other mind self and society  the generalized other is an organized and generalized attitude mind self and society  with reference to which the individual defines her own conduct when the individual can view herself from the standpoint of the generalized other self consciousness in the full sense of the term is attained the game then is the stage of the social process at which the individual attains selfhood one of meads most outstanding contributions to the development of critical social theory is his analysis of games mead elucidates the full social and psychological significance of gameplaying and the extent to which the game functions as an instrument of social control the following passage contains a remarkable piece of analysis what goes on in the game goes on in the life of the child all the time he is continually taking the attitudes of those about him especially the roles of those who in some sense control him and on whom he depends he gets the function of the process in an abstract way at first it goes over from the play into the game in a real sense he has to play the game the morale of the game takes hold of the child more than the larger morale of the whole community the child passes into the game and the game expresses a social situation in which he can completely enter its morale may have a greater hold on him than that of the family to which he belongs or the community in which he lives there are all sorts of social organizations some of which are fairly lasting some temporary into which the child is entering and he is playing a sort of social game in them it is a period in which he likes to belong and he gets into organizations which come into existence and pass out of existence he becomes a something which can function in the organized whole and thus tends to determine himself in his relationship with the group to which he belongs that process is one which is a striking stage in the development of the childs morale it constitutes him a selfconscious member of the community to which he belongs mind self and society  emphasis added the me and the i although the self is a product of sociosymbolic interaction it is not merely a passive reflection of the generalized other the individuals response to the social world is active she decides what she will do in the light of the attitudes of others but her conduct is not mechanically determined by such attitudinal structures there are it would appear two phases or poles of the self  that phase which reflects the attitude of the generalized other and  that phase which responds to the attitude of the generalized other here mead distinguishes between the me and the i the me is the social self and the i is a response to the me mind self and society  the i is the response of the organism to the attitudes of the others the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which one himself assumes mind self and society  mead defines the me as a conventional habitual individual and the i as the novel reply of the individual to the generalized other mind self and society  there is a dialectical relationship between society and the individual and this dialectic is enacted on the intrapsychic level in terms of the polarity of the me and the i the me is the internalization of roles which derive from such symbolic processes as linguistic interaction playing and gaming whereas the i is a creative response to the symbolized structures of the me that is to the generalized other although the i is not an object of immediate experience it is in a sense knowable that is objectifiable the i is apprehended in memory but in the memory image the i is no longer a pure subject but a subject that is now an object of observation selected writings  we can understand the structural and functional significance of the i but we cannot observe it directly — it appears only ex post facto we remember the responses of the i to the me and this is as close as we can get to a concrete knowledge of the i the objectification of the i is possible only through an awareness of the past but the objectified i is never the subject of present experience if you ask then where directly in your own experience the i comes in the answer is that it comes in as a historical figure mind self and society  the i appears as a symbolized object in our consciousness of our past actions but then it has become part of the me the me is in a sense that phase of the self that represents the past that is the alreadyestablished generalized other the i which is a response to the me represents action in a present that is that which is actually going on taking place and implies the restructuring of the me in a future after the i has acted we can catch it in our memory and place it in terms of that which we have done but it is now in the newly emerged present an aspect of the restructured me mind self and society   because of the temporalhistorical dimension of the self the character of the i is determinable only after it has occurred the i is not therefore subject to predetermination particular acts of the i become aspects of the me in the sense that they are objectified through memory but the i as such is not contained in the me the human individual exists in a social situation and responds to that situation the situation has a particular character but this character does not completely determine the response of the individual there seem to be alternative courses of action the individual must select a course of action and even a decision to do nothing is a response to the situation and act accordingly but the course of action she selects is not dictated by the situation it is this indeterminacy of response that gives the sense of freedom of initiative mind self and society  the action of the i is revealed only in the action itself specific prediction of the action of the i is not possible the individual is determined to respond but the specific character of her response is not fully determined the individuals responses are conditioned but not determined by the situation in which she acts mind self and society  human freedom is conditioned freedom thus the i and the me exist in dynamic relation to one another the human personality or self arises in a social situation this situation structures the me by means of intersubjective symbolic processes language gestures play games etc and the active organism as it continues to develop must respond to its situation and to its me this response of the active organism is the i the individual takes the attitude of the me or the attitude of the i according to situations in which she finds herself for mead both aspects of the i and the me are essential to the self in its full expression mind self and society  both community and individual autonomy are necessary to identity the i is process breaking through structure the me is a necessary symbolic structure which renders the action of the i possible and without this structure of things the life of the self would become impossible mind self and society  the dialectic of self and other the self arises when the individual takes the attitude of the generalized other toward herself this internalization of the generalized other occurs through the individuals participation in the conversation of significant symbols that is language and in other socialization processes eg play and games the self then is of great value to organized society the internalization of the conversation of significant symbols and of other interactional symbolic structures allows for the superior coordination of society as a whole and for the increased efficiency of the individual as a member of the group mind self and society  the generalized other internalized in the me is a major instrument of social control it is the mechanism by which the community gains control over the conduct of its individual members mind self and society social control in meads words is the expression of the me over against the expression of the i mind self and society  the genesis of the self in social process is thus a condition of social control the self is a social emergent that supports the cohesion of the group individual will is harmonized by means of a socially defined and symbolized reality with social goals and values in so far as there are social acts writes mead there are social objects and i take it that social control is bringing the act of the individual into relation with this social object the philosophy of the act  thus there are two dimensions of meads theory of internalization  the internalization of the attitudes of others toward oneself and toward one another that is internalization of the interpersonal process and  the internalization of the attitudes of others toward the various phases or aspects of the common social activity or set of social undertakings in which as members of an organized society or social group they are all engaged mind self and society  the self then has reference not only to others but to social projects and goals and it is by means of the socialization process that is the internalization of the generalized other through language play and the game that the individual is brought to assume the attitudes of those in the group who are involved with him in his social activities the philosophy of the act  by learning to speak gesture and play in appropriate ways the individual is brought into line with the accepted symbolized roles and rules of the social process the self is therefore one of the most subtle and effective instruments of social control for mead however social control has its limits one of these limits is the phenomenon of the i as described in the preceding section another limit to social control is presented in meads description of specific social relations this description has important consequences regarding the way in which the concept of the generalized other is to be applied in social analysis the self emerges out of a special set of social relations with all the other individuals involved in a given set of social projects mind self and society  the self is always a reflection of specific social relations that are themselves founded on the specific mode of activity of the group in question the concept of property for example presupposes a community with certain kinds of responses the idea of property has specific social and historical foundations and symbolizes the interests and values of specific social groups mead delineates two types of social groups in civilized communities there are on the one hand concrete social classes or subgroups in which individual members are directly related to one another on the other hand there are abstract social classes or subgroups in which individual members are related to one another only more or less indirectly and which only more or less indirectly function as social units but which afford unlimited possibilities for the widening and ramifying and enriching of the social relations among all the individual members of the given society as an organized and unified whole mind self and society  such abstract social groups provide the opportunity for a radical extension of the definite social relations which constitute the individuals sense of self and which structure her conduct human society then contains a multiplicity of generalized others the individual is capable of holding membership in different groups both simultaneously and serially and may therefore relate herself to different generalized others at different times or she may extend her conception of the generalized other by identifying herself with a larger community than the one in which she has hitherto been involved eg she may come to view herself as a member of a nation rather than as a member of a tribe the self is not confined within the limits of any one generalized other it is true that the self arises through the internalization of the generalized attitudes of others but there is it would appear no absolute limit to the individuals capacity to encompass new others within the dynamic structure of the self this makes strict and total social control difficult if not impossible meads description of social relations also has interesting implications visavis the sociological problem of the relation between consensus and conflict in society it is clear that both consensus and conflict are significant dimensions of social process and in meads view the problem is not to decide either for a consensus model of society or for a conflict model but to describe as directly as possible the function of both consensus and conflict in human social life there are two models of consensusconflict relation in meads analysis of social relations these may be schematized as follows intragroup consensus — extragroup conflict intragroup conflict — extragroup consensus in the first model the members of a given group are united in opposition to another group which is characterized as the common enemy of all members of the first group mead points out that the idea of a common enemy is central in much of human social organization and that it is frequently the major referencepoint of intragroup consensus for example a great many human organizations derive their raison detre and their sense of solidarity from the existence or putative existence of the enemy communists atheists infidels fascist pigs religious fanatics liberals conservatives or whatever the generalized other of such an organization is formed in opposition to the generalized other of the enemy the individual is with the members of her group and against members of the enemy group meads second model that of intragroup conflict and extragroup consensus is employed in his description of the process in which the individual reacts against her own group the individual opposes her group by appealing to a higher sort of community that she holds to be superior to her own she may do this by appealing to the past eg she may ground her criticism of the bureaucratic state in a conception of jeffersonian democracy or by appealing to the future eg she may point to the ideal of all mankind of the universal community an ideal that has the future as its everreceding reference point thus intragroup conflict is carried on in terms of an extragroup consensus even if the consensus is merely assumed or posited this model presupposes meads conception of the multiplicity of generalized others ie the field within which conflicts are possible it is also true that the individual can criticize her group only in so far as she can symbolize to herself the generalized other of that group otherwise she would have nothing to criticize nor would she have the motivation to do so it is in this sense that social criticism presupposes social symbolic process and a social self capable of symbolic reflexive activity in addition to the abovedescribed models of consensusconflict relation mead also points out an explicitly temporal interaction between consensus and conflict human conflicts often lead to resolutions that create new forms of consensus thus when such conflicts occur they can lead to whole reconstructions of the particular social situations that are the contexts of the conflicts eg a war between two nations may be followed by new political alignments in which the two warring nations become allies such reconstructions of society are effected by the minds of individuals in conflict and constitute enlargements of the social whole an interesting consequence of meads analysis of social conflict is that the reconstruction of society will entail the reconstruction of the self this aspect of the social dynamic is particularly clear in terms of meads concept of intragroup conflict and his description of the dialectic of the me and the i as pointed out earlier the i is an emergent response to the generalized other and the me is that phase of the self that represents the social situation within which the individual must operate thus the critical capacity of the self takes form in the i and has two dimensions  explicit self criticism aimed at the me is implicit social criticism and  explicit social criticism is implicit self criticism for example the criticism of ones own moral principles is also the criticism of the morality of ones social world for personal morality is rooted in social morality conversely the criticism of the morality of ones society raises questions concerning ones own moral role in the social situation since self and society are dialectical poles of a single process change in one pole will result in change in the other pole it would appear that social reconstructions are effected by individuals or groups of individuals who find themselves in conflict with a given society and once the reconstruction is accomplished the new social situation generates farreaching changes in the personality structures of the individuals involved in that situation in short writes mead social reconstruction and self or personality reconstruction are the two sides of a single process — the process of human social evolution mind self and society   the temporal structure of human existence the temporal structure of human existence according to mead can be described in terms of the concepts of emergence sociality and freedom emergence and temporality what is the ground of the temporality of human experience temporal structure according to mead arises with the appearance of novel or emergent events in experience the emergent event is an unexpected disruption of continuity an inhibition of passage the emergent in other words constitutes a problem for human action a problem to be overcome the emergent event which arises in a present establishes a barrier between present and future emergence is an inhibition of individual and collective conduct a disharmony that projects experience into a distant future in which harmony may be reinstituted the initial temporal structure of human timeconsciousness lies in the separation of present and future by the emergent event the actor blocked in his activity confronts the emergent problem in his present and looks to the future as the field of potential resolution of conflict the future is a temporally and frequently spatially distant realm to be reached through intelligent action human action is actionintime mead argues out that without inhibition of activity and without the distance created by the inhibition there can be no experience of time further mead believes that without the rupture of continuity there can be no experience at all experience presupposes change as well as permanence without disruption there would be merely the passage of events the philosophy of the act  and mere passage does not constitute change passage is pure continuity without interruption a phenomenon of which humans with the possible exception of a few mystics have precious little experience change arises with a departure from continuity change does not however involve the total obliteration of continuity — there must be a persisting nonpassing content against which an emergent event is experienced as a change the philosophy of the act  experience begins with the problematic continuity itself cannot be experienced unless it is broken that is continuity is not an object of awareness unless it becomes problematic and continuity becomes problematic as a result of the emergence of discontinuous events hence continuity and discontinuity emergence are not contradictories but dialectical polarities mutually dependent levels of reality that generate experience itself the now is contrasted with a then and implies that a background which is irrelevant to the difference between them has been secured within which the now and the then may appear there must be banks within which the stream of time may flow the philosophy of the act  emergence then is a fundamental condition of experience and the experience of the emergent is the experience of temporality emergence sunders present and future and is thereby an occasion for action action moreover occurs in time the human act is infected with time — it aims at the future human action is teleological discontinuity therefore and not continuity in the sense of mere duration or passage is the foundation of timeexperience and of experience itself the emergent event constitutes time ie creates the necessity of time the function of the past in human experience the emergent event is not only a problem for ongoing activity it also constitutes a problem for rationality reason according to mead is the search for causal continuity in experience and in fact must presuppose such continuity in its attempt to construct a coherent account of reality reason must assume that all natural events can be reduced to conditions that make the events possible but the emergent event presents itself as discontinuous as a disruption without conditions it is by means of the reconstruction of the past that the discontinuous event becomes continuous in experience the character of the past is that it connects what is unconnected in the merging of one present into another the nature of the past  in selected writings  the emergent event when placed within a reconstructed past is a determined event but since this past was reconstructed from the perspective of the emergent event the emergent event is also a determining event the philosophy of the present  the emergent event itself indicates the continuities within which the event may be viewed as continuous there is then no question of predicting the emergent for it is by definition and also experientially unpredictable but once the emergent appears in experience it may be placed within a continuity dictated by its own character determination of the emergent is retrospective determination meads conception of time entails a drastic revision of the idea of the irrevocability of the past the past is both irrevocable and revocable the philosophy of the present  there is no sense in the idea of an independent or real past for the past is always formulated in the light of the emerging present it is necessary to continually reformulate the past from the point of view of the newly emergent situation for example the movement for the liberation of africanamericans has led to the discovery of the american blacks cultural past black or africanamerican history is in effect a function of the emergence of the civil rights movement in the late s and early s and the subsequent development of that movement as far as most americans were hitherto concerned there simply was no history of the american black — there was only a history of white europeans which included the history of slavery in america there can be no finality in historical accounts the past is irrevocable in the sense that something has happened but what has happened that is the essence of the past is always open to question and reinterpretation further the irrevocability of the past is found in the extension of the necessity with which what has just happened conditions what is emerging in the future the philosophy of the present  irrevocability is a characteristic of the past only in relation to the demands of a present looking into the future that is to say that even the sense that something has happened arises out of a situation in which an emergent event has appeared as a problem like edmund husserl mead conceives of human consciousness as intentional in its structure and orientation the world of conscious experience is intended meant constituted constructed by consciousness thus objectivity can have meaning only within the domain of the subject the realm of consciousness it is not that the existence of the objective world is constituted by consciousness but that the meaning of that world is so constituted in husserlian language the existence of the objective world is transcendent ie independent of consciousness but the meaning of the objective world is immanent ie dependent on consciousness in meads phenomenology of historical experience then the past may be said to possess an objective existence but the meaning of the past is constituted or constructed according to the intentional concerns of historical thought the meaning of the past what has happened is defined by an historical consciousness that is rooted in a present and that is opening upon a newly emergent future history is founded on human action in response to emergent events action is an attempt to adjust to changes that emerge in experience the telos of the act is the reestablishment of a sundered continuity since the past is instrumental in the reestablishment of continuity the adjustment to the emergent requires the creation of history by looking into the future mead observes society acquired a history the philosophy of the act  and the future orientation of history entails that every new discovery every new project will alter our picture of the past although mead discounts the possibility of a transcendent past that is a past independent of any present he does not deny the possibility of validity in historical accounts an historical account will be valid or correct not absolutely but in relation to a specific emergent context accounts of the past become valid in interpreting the world in so far as they present a history of becoming in the world leading up to that which is becoming today      the philosophy of the present  historical thought is valid in so far as it renders change intelligible and permits the continuation of activity an appeal to an absolutely correct account of the past is not only impossible but also irrelevant to the actual conduct of historical inquiry a meaningful past is a usable past historians are to be sure concerned with the truth of historical accounts ie with the objectivity of the past the historical conscience seeks to reconstruct the past on the basis of evidence and to present an accurate interpretation of the data of history meads point is that all such reconstructions and interpretations of the past are grounded in a present that is opening into a future and that the timeconditioned nature and interests of historical thought made the construction of a purely objective historical account impossible historical consciousness is subjective in the sense that it aims at an interpretation of the past that will be humanly meaningful in the present and in the foreseeable future thus for mead historical inquiry is the imaginativebuthonest intelligentandintelligible reconstruction and interpretation of the human past on the basis of all available and relevant evidence above all the historian seeks to define the meaning of the human past and in that way to make a contribution to humanitys search for an overall understanding of human existence sociality and time the emergent event then is basic to meads theory of time the emergent event is a becoming an unexpected occurrence which in its relation to other events gives structure to time the philosophy of the present  but what is the ontological status of emergence what is its relation to the general structure of reality the possibility of emergence is grounded in meads conception of the relatedness the sociality of natural processes meads philosophy arises from a fundamental ecological vision of the world a vision of the world containing a multiplicity of related systems eg the bee system and the flower system which together form the beeflower system nature is a system of systems or relationships it is not a collection of particles or fragments which are actually separate distinctions for mead are abstractions within fields of activity and all natural objects animate or inanimate exist within systems apart from which the existence of the objects themselves is unthinkable the sense of the organic body arises with reference to external objects and these external objects in turn derive their character from their relation to an organic individual the bodyobject and the physical object arise with reference to each other and it is this relationship in meads view that constitutes the reality of each referent it is over against the surfaces of other things that the outside of the organism arises in experience and then the experiences of the organism which are not in such contacts become the inside of the organism it is a process in which the organism is bounded and other things are bounded as well the philosophy of the act  similarly the resistance of the object to organic pressure is in effect the activity of the object and this activity becomes the inside of the object the inside of the object moreover is not a projection from the organism but is there in the relation between the organism and thing see the philosophy of the present    the relation between organism and object then is a social relation the philosophy of the act  thus the relation between a natural object or event and the system within which it exists is not unidirectional the character of the object on the one hand is determined by its membership in a system but on the other hand the character of the system is determined by the activity of the object or event there is a mutual determination of object and system organism and environment percipient event and consentient set the philosophy of the act  while this mutuality of individual and system is characteristic of all natural processes mead is particularly concerned with the biological realm and lays great emphasis on the interdependence and interaction of organism and environment whereas the environment provides the conditions within which the acts of the organism emerge as possibilities it is the activity of the organism that transforms the character of the environment thus an animal with the power of digesting and assimilating what could not before be digested and assimilated is the condition for the appearance of food in his environment the philosophy of the act  in this respect what the individual is determines what the character of his environment will be the philosophy of the act  the relation of organism and environment is not static but dynamic the activities of the environment alter the organism and the activities of the organism alter the environment the organismenvironment relation is moreover complex rather than simple the environment of any organism contains a multiplicity of processes perspectives systems any one of which may become a factor in the organisms field of activity the ability of the organism to act with reference to a multiplicity of situations is an example of the sociality of natural events and it is by virtue of this sociality this capacity of being several things at once the philosophy of the present  that the organism is able to encounter novel occurrences by moving from one system to another the organism confronts unfamiliar and unexpected situations which because of their novelty constitute problems of adjustment for the organism these emergent situations are possible given the multiplicity of natural processes and given the ability of natural events eg organisms to occupy several systems at once a bee for example is capable of relating to other bees to flowers to bears to little boys albeit with various attitudes but sociality is not restricted to animate events a mountain may be simultaneously an aspect of geography part of a landscape an object of religious veneration the dialectical pole of a valley and so forth the capacity of sociality is a universal character of nature there are then two modes of sociality  sociality characterizes the process of readjustment by which an organism incorporates an emergent event into its ongoing experience this sociality in passage which is given in immediate relation of the past and present constitutes the temporal mode of sociality the philosophy of the present   a natural event is social not only by virtue of its dynamic relationship with newly emergent situations but also by virtue of its simultaneous membership in different systems at any given instant in any given present the location of the object in one system places it in the others as well the philosophy of the present  the object is social not merely in terms of its temporal relations but also in terms of its relations with other objects in an instantaneous field this mode of sociality constitutes the emergent event that is the state of a system at a given instant is the social reality within which emergent events occur and it is this reality that must be adjusted to the exigencies of time thus the principle of sociality is the ontological foundation of meads concept of emergence sociality is the ground of the possibility of emergence as well as the basis on which emergent events are incorporated into the structure of ongoing experience temporality and the problem of freedom when meads theory of the self is placed in the context of his description of the temporality of human existence it is possible to construct an account not only of the reality of human freedom but also of the conditions that give rise to the experience of loss of freedom mead grounds his analysis of human consciousness in the social process of communication and on that foundation makes the other an integral part of self understanding the world in which the self lives then is an inter subjective and interactive world — a populated world containing not only the individual self but also other persons intersubjectivity is to be explained in terms of that meeting of minds which occurs in conversation learning reading and thinking the philosophy of the act  it is on the basis of such sociosymbolic interactions between individuals and by means of the conceptual symbols of the communicational process that the mind and the self come into existence the human world is also temporally structured and the temporality of experience mead argues is a flow that is primarily present the past is part of my experience now and the projected future is also part of my experience now there is hardly a moment when turning to the temporality of my life i do not find myself existing in the now thus it would appear that whatever is for me is now and needless to say whatever is of importance or whatever is meaningful for me is of importance or is meaningful now this is true even if that which is important and meaningful for me is located in the past or in the future existential time is time lived in the now my existence is rooted in a living present and it is within this living present that my life unfolds and discloses itself thus to gain full contact with oneself it is necessary to focus ones consciousness on the present and to appropriate that present that existential situation as ones own this philosophy of the present need not lead to a careless live only for today attitude our past is always with us in the form of memory history tradition etc and it provides a context for the living present we live in the present but also out of the past and to live well now we cannot afford to forget the past a fully meaningful human existence must be lived now but with continual reference to the past we must continue to affirm that which has been good and we must work to eliminate or to avoid that which has been bad moreover a full human existence must be lived not only inthepresentoutofthepast but also in thepresenttowardthefuture the human present opens toward the future today must always be lived with a concern for tomorrow for we are continually moving toward the future whether we like it or not further we are called into this future toward ever new possibilities and we must if we wish to live well develop a right mindfulness which orients our present centered consciousness toward the possibilities and challenges of the impending future but we must live now with reference to both past and future the self as we have seen is characterized in part by its activity the i in response to its world and how the individual is active with respect to his world is through his choices and his awareness of his choices the individual experiences himself as having choices or as being confronted with situations which require choices on his part he does not ordinarily experience himself as being controlled by the world the world presents obstacles to him and yet he experiences himself as being able to respond to these obstacles in a variety even though a finite variety of ways one loses ones freedom even ones selfhood when one is unaware of ones choices or when one refuses to face the fact that one has choices from the standpoint of meads description of the temporality of action and his emphasis on the importance of problematic situations in human experience emergencies or crises in ones life are of the utmost existential significance i am a being that exists in relation to a world as such it is essential that i experience myself as in harmony with the world and if this proves difficult or impossible then i am thrown into a crisis ie i am threatened with separation greek krisis from the world and separation from the world from the standpoint of a being intheworld is tantamount to non being it is in this context that the loss of ones freedom the experience of lost autonomy becomes a real possibility encountering a crisis in the process of life the individual may well experience himself as paralyzed as stuck in his situation as patient rather than as agent of change but it is also the case that the experience of crisis may lead to a deepened sense of ones active involvement in the temporal unfolding of life from meads point of view a crisis is a crucial time or a turningpoint in individual existence negatively it is a threat to the individuals continuity in and with his world positively it is an opportunity to redefine broaden and deepen the individuals sense of self and of the world to which the self is ontologically related thus it would appear that crises may in fact undermine the sense of freedom of choice and yet it is also true that crises constitute opportunities for the exercise of freedom since such breaks or discontinuities in our experience demand that we make decisions as to what we are going to do now in this way breakdowns might be viewed as breakthroughs freedom denied on one level of experience is rediscovered at another one must lose oneself in order to find oneself  perception and reflection meads theory of perspectives meads concept of sociality as we have seen implies a vision of reality as situational or perspectival a perspective is the world in its relationship to the individual and the individual in his relationship to the world the philosophy of the act  a perspective then is a situation in which a percipient event or individual exists with reference to a consentient set or environment and in which a consentient set exists with reference to a percipient event there are obviously many such situations or perspectives these are not in meads view imperfect representations of an absolute reality that transcends all particular situations on the contrary these situations are the reality which is the world the philosophy of the act  distance experience for mead perceptual objects arise within the act and are instrumental in the consummation of the act at the perceptual stage of the act these objects are distant from the perceiving individual they are over there they are not here and not now the distance is both spatial and temporal such objects invite the perceiving individual to act with reference to them to make contact with them thus mead speaks of perceptual objects as plans of action that control the action of the individual the philosophy of the present  and the philosophy of the act  distance experience implies contact experience perception leads on to manipulation the readiness of the individual to make contact with distant objects is what mead calls a terminal attitude terminal attitudes are beginnings of the contact response that will be made to the object when the object is reached the philosophy of the act  such attitudes are those which if carried out into overt action would lead to movements which if persevered in would overcome the distances and bring the objects into the manipulatory sphere the philosophy of the act  a terminal attitude then is an implicit manipulation of a distant object it stands at the beginning of the act and is an intellectualandemotional posture in terms of which the individual encounters the world as present in the beginning of the act the terminal attitude contains the later stages of the act in the sense that perception implies manipulation and in the sense that manipulation is aimed at the resolution of a problem in terminal attitudes all stages of the act interpenetrate within the act then there is a tendency on the part of the perceiving individual to approach distant objects in terms of the values of the manipulatory sphere distant objects are perceived with the dimensions they would have if they were brought within the field in which we could both handle and see them the philosophy of the act  for example a distant shape is seen as being palpable as having a certain size and weight as having such and such a texture and so forth in perception the manipulatory area is extended and the distant object becomes hypothetically a contact object in immediate perceptual experience the distant object is in the future contact with the distant object is implicit ie anticipated the percept according to mead is there as a promise the philosophy of the act  in so far as the act of perception involves terminal attitudes the promise or futurity of the distant object is collapsed into a hypothetical now in which the perceiving individual and the perceptual object exist simultaneously the temporal distance between individual and object is thus suspended this suspension of time permits alternative and perhaps conflicting contact reactions to the object to be tested in imagination thus the act may be completed in abstraction before it is completed in fact in this sense the percept is a collapsed act the philosophy of the act  the contemporaneity of individual and distant object is an abstraction within the act in the collapsed act time is abstracted from space for the purposes of our conduct the philosophy of the present  prior to actual manipulation the perceiving individual anticipates a variety of ways in which a given object might be manipulated this implicit testing of alternative responses to the distant object is the essence of reflective conduct the actual futurity of the distant object is suspended and the object is treated as though it were present in the manipulatory area the time of the collapsed act therefore is an abstracted time that involves the experience of inhibited action in which the goal is present as achieved through the individual assuming the attitude of contact response and thus leaving the events that should elapse between the beginning and the end of the act present only in their abstracted character as passing the philosophy of the act  thus in the abstracted time of the collapsed act certain objects cease to be events cease to pass as they are in reality passing and in their permanence become the conditions of our action and events take place with reference to them the philosophy of the present  the perceiving individuals terminal attitudes constitute an anticipatory contact experience in which the futurity of distant objects is reduced to an abstract contemporaneity this reduction of futurity we have seen is instrumental in the reflective conduct of the acting individual in perception then distant objects are reduced to the manipulatory area and become hypothetically contact objects the fundamentals of perception are the spatiotemporal distances of objects lying outside the manipulatory area and the readiness of the organism to act toward them as they will be if they come within the manipulatory area the philosophy of the act  perception involves the assumption of contact qualities in the distant object the object is removed from its actual temporal position and is incorporated in a permanent space which is actually the space of the manipulatory area hypothetically extended the philosophy of the act  the object which is actually spatiotemporally distant becomes hypothetically and for the purposes of reflective conduct spatiotemporally present it is in the perceiving individuals assumption of the contact attitude both here and now perspectives early modern accounts of perception in an attempt to ground the theories and methods of modern science in a philosophical framework made a distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of objects galileo articulated the latter distinction as follows i feel myself impelled by the necessity as soon as i conceive a piece of matter or corporeal substance of conceiving that in its own nature it is bounded and figured in such and such a figure that in relation to others it is either large or small that it is in this or that place in this or that time that it is in motion or remains at rest     that it is single few or many in short by no imagination can a body be separated from such conditions but that it must be white or red bitter or sweet sounding or mute of a pleasant or unpleasant odour i do not perceive my mind forced to acknowledge it necessarily accompanied by such conditions so if the senses are not the escorts perhaps the reason or the imagination by itself would never have arrived at them hence i think that these tastes odours colors etc on the side of the object in which they seem to exist are nothing but mere names but hold their residence solely in the sensitive body so that if the animal were removed every such quality would be abolished and annihilated quoted by ea burtt the metaphysical foundations of modern physical science doubleday   another way of putting this is to say that the primary qualities of an object are those which are subject to precise mathematical calculation whereas the secondary qualities of the object are those which are rooted in the sensibility of the perceiving organism and which are therefore not objectively quantifiable the primary qualities number position extension bulk and so forth are there in the object but the secondary qualities are subjective reactions to the object on the part of the sensitive organism a corollary of this doctrine is that the primary qualities because they are objective are more knowable than are the subjective secondary qualities a serious breakdown in the theory of primary and secondary qualities appeared in the critical epistemology of george berkeley according to berkeley whatever we know of objects we know on the basis of perception the primary as well as the secondary qualities of objects are apprehended in sensation moreover primary qualities are never perceived except in conjunction with secondary qualities both primary and secondary qualities therefore are derived from perception and are ideas in the mind when we know the primary qualities of an object what we know are our own ideas and sensations thus berkeley calls into question the objectivity of the primary qualities these qualities it would appear are as dependent upon a perceiving organism as are secondary qualities the outcome of berkeleys radical subjectivism which reaches its apogee in the skepticism of hume is an epistemological crisis in which the knowability of the external world is rendered problematic meads account of distance experience offers a description of the experiential basis of the separation of primary and secondary qualities in the exigencies of action we have seen there is a tendency on the part of the acting individual to reduce distant objects to the contact area it is this collapsing of the act according to mead which is responsible for the so called subjective nature of the secondary qualities    of objects the philosophy of the act  the contact characters of the object become the main focus within the act while the distance characters are bracketed out that is held in suspension or ignored for the time being for the purposes of conduct the reality of what we see is what we can handle the philosophy of the act  in meads analysis of perception the distinction between distance and contact characters is roughly equivalent to the traditional distinction between secondary and primary qualities respectively for mead however the distance characters of an object are not subjective but are as objective as the contact characters distance characters such as color sound odor and taste are there in the act they appear in the transition from impulse to perception and are present even in manipulation in the manipulatory area one actually handles the colored odorous sounding sapid object the distance characters seem to be no longer distant and the object answers to a collapsed act the philosophy of the act  meads theory of perspectives is in effect an attempt to make clear the objective intentionality of perceptual experience in meads relational conception of biological existence there is a mutual determination of organism and environment the character of the organism determines the environment just as the character of the environment determines the organism in his opposition to outright environmental determinism mead points out that the sensitivity selectivity and organizational capacities of organisms are sources of the control of the environment by the form on the human level for example we find the phenomenon of attention the human being selects her stimuli and thereby organizes the field within which she acts attention then is characterized by its selectivity and organizing tendency here we have the organism as acting and deter mining its environment it is not simply a set of passive senses played upon by the stimuli that come from without the organism goes out and determines what it is going to respond to and organizes the world mind self and society  attention is the foundation of human intelligence it is the capacity of attention that gives us control over our experience and conduct attention is one of the elements of human freedom the relation between organism and environment is in a word interactive the perceptual object arises within this interactive matrix and is determined by its reference to some percipient event or individual in a consentient set the philosophy of the act  in other words perceptual objects are perspectively determined and perspectives are determined by perceiving individuals even when we consider only sense data the object is clearly a function of the whole situation whose perspective is determined by the individual there are peculiarities in the objects which depend upon the individual as an organism and the spatiotemporal position of the individual it is one of the important results of the modern doctrine of relativity that we are forced to recognize that we cannot account for these peculiarities by stating the individual in terms of his environment the philosophy of the act  the perceiving individual cannot be explained in terms of the socalled external world since that individual is a necessary condition of the appearance of that world mead thus abandons on the basis of his interpretation of relativity theory the object of newtonian physics but in addition to denying the concrete existence of independent objects he also denies the existence of the independent psyche there is nothing subjective about perceptual experience if objects exist with reference to the perceiving individual it is also true that the perceiving individual exists with reference to objects the qualities of objects distance as well as contact qualities exist in the relation between the perceiving individual and the world the socalled secondary sensuous qualities therefore are objectively present in the individualworld matrix sensuous characters are there in a given perspective on reality in actual perceptual experience the object is objectively present in relation to the individual whereas the relation between the world and the perceiving individual led berkeley to a radical subjectification of experience meads relationism leads him to an equally radical objectification of experience perspectives in meads view are objectively real perspectives are there in nature and natural reality is the overall organization of perspectives there is so far as we can directly know no natural reality beyond the organization of perspectives no noumena no independent world of physical particles in absolute space and time the philosophy of the present  the cosmos is nature stratified into a multiplicity of perspectives all of which are interrelated perspectival stratifications of nature are not only there in nature but they are the only forms of nature that are there the philosophy of the present  the scientific object mead distinguishes two main types of perspective  the perceptual perspective and  the reflective perspective a perceptual perspective is rooted in the spacetime world in which action is unreflective this is the world of immediate perceptual experience a reflective perspective is a response to the world of perceptual perspectives the perspectives of fig trees and wasps are from the standpoint of the trees and wasps hypothetically considered perceptually independent except for certain points of intersection that is actual contacts but in the reflective perspective of the man who plants the fig trees and insures the presence of the wasps both lifehistories run their courses and their intersection provides a dimension from which their interconnection maintains their species the philosophy of the act  reflectively the fig tree perspective and the wasp perspective form a single perspective that includes the perspectives of both the philosophy of the act  the world of reflective perspectives is the world of reflective thought and action the world of distance experience and the world of scientific inquiry it is within the reflective perspective that the hypothetical objects of the collapsed act arise since meads conception of distance experience has been discussed earlier the present analysis will concentrate on the emergence of the scientific object in reflective experience corresponding to the two types of perspective outlined above are two attitudes toward the perceptual objects which arise in experience there is first and corresponding to the perceptual perspective the attitude of immediate experience which is grounded in the world that is there the philosophy of the act  the world that is there a phrase mead uses over and over again includes our own acts our own bodies and our own psychological responses to the things that emerge in our ongoing activity perceptual objects in the world that is there are what they appear to be in their relation to the perceiving individual the second attitude toward perceptual objects is that of reflective analysis which attempts to set forth the preconditions of perceptual experience this attitude corresponds to the reflective perspective it is through reflective analysis of perceptual objects that scientific objects are constructed examples of scientific objects are the newtonian notions of absolute space and absolute time the concept of the world at an instant absolute simultaneity the notion of ultimate elements atoms electrons particles and so on such objects according to mead are hypothetical abstractions which arise in the scientific attempt to explain the world of immediate experience the whole tendency of the natural sciences as exhibited especially in physics and chemistry is to replace the objects of immediate experience by hypothetical objects which lie beyond the range of possible experience the philosophy of the act  scientific objects are not objects of experience science accounts for the perceptible in terms of the non perceptible and often the imperceptible there is a danger in the reflective analysis of the world that is there namely the reification of scientific objects and the subjectification of perceptual objects that is it is possible to conceive of the perceptual world as a product of organic sensitivity including human consciousness while the world of scientific objects is conceived of as entirely independent of perceiving individuals the philosophy of the act   according to mead this formulation of the relation between scientific objects and perceptual objects is entirely uncritical the philosophy of the act  the alleged separation of scientific and perceptual objects leads to a bifurcated nature in which experience is cut off from reality through the dualism of primary and secondary qualities meads critique of the latter doctrine discussed above reveals that the organism is a part of the physical world we are explaining the philosophy of the act  and that the perceptual object with all of its qualities is objectively there in the relation between organism and world the scientific object moreover has ultimate reference to the perceptual world the act of reflective analysis within which the scientific object arises presupposes the world that is there in perceptual experience scientific objects are abstractions within the reflective act and are in effect attempts to account for the objects of perceptual experience and it is to the world that is there that the scientist must go to confirm or disconfirm the hypothetical objects of scientific theory reflective analysis thus arises within and presupposes an unreflective world of immediate experience and it is this immediate world which is the final test of the reality of scientific hypotheses as well as the test of the truth of all our ideas and suppositions mind self and society  in mind self and society mead refers to the unreflective world as the world of the biologic individual the term he points out refers to the individual in an attitude and at a moment in which the impulses sustain an unfractured relation with the objects around him     i have termed it biologic because the term lays emphasis on the living reality which may be distinguished from reflection a later reflection turns back upon it and endeavors to present the complete interrelationship between the world and the individual in terms of physical stimuli and biological mechanisms scientific objects the actual experience did not take place in this hypothetical form but in the form of unsophisticated reality mind self and society   emphasis added the world that is there is prior to the reflective world of scientific theory the reification of scientific objects at the expense of perceptual experience is in meads view the product of an uncritical scientific imagination the philosophy of the act  meads analysis of the scientific object is an attempt to establish the actual relation between reflective analysis and perceptual experience his aim is to demonstrate the objective reality of the perceptual world he does not however deny the reality of scientific objects scientific objects are hypothetical objects which are real in so far as they render the experiential world intelligible and controllable harold n lee in discussing meads philosophy points out that the task of science is to understand the world we live in and to enable us to act intelligently within it it is not to construct a new and artificial world except in so far as the artificial picture aids in understanding and controlling the world we live in the artificial picture is not be substituted for the world lee  emphasis added scientific knowledge is not final but hypothetical and the reality of scientific objects is therefore hypothetical rather than absolute reflective conduct takes place with reference to problems that emerge in the world that is there and the construction of scientific objects is aimed at solving these problems problematic situations occur within the world that is there it is not the entire world of experience that becomes problematic but only aspects of that world and while the scientific attitude is ready to question everything it does not question everything at once selected writings  the scientist according to mead always deals with an actual problem he does not question the whole world of meaning but only that part of the world which has come into conflict with accepted doctrine the unquestioned aspects of the world form the necessary field without which no conflict can arise the possible calling in question of any content whatever it may be means always that there is left a field of unquestioned reality selected writings  it is to this field of unquestioned reality that the scientist returns to test his reconstructed theory the world of the scientist is always there as one in which reconstruction is taking place with continual shifting of problems but as a real world within which the problems arise selected writings  emphasis added  philosophy of history a the nature of history history according to mead is the collective time of the social act historical thought arises in response to emergent events crises new situations unexpected disruptions that are confronted in community life meads general description of experiential time holds with reference to the time of historical experience the continuity of experience is rendered problematic by the emergent event present and future are cut off from each other and the past both in terms of its content and of its meaning is called into question the past is reconstructed in such a way that the emergent event is seen as continuous with the past in this manner the present difficulty becomes intelligible and the emergent discontinuity of experience is potentially resolvable historical thought is a reconstruction of a communal past in an attempt to understand the nature and significance of a communal present and a potential communal future historical accounts are never final since historical thought continually restates the past in terms of newly emergent situations in a present that opens upon a future human life is an ongoing process that is temporally structured the existential present the now within which we act is dynamic and implies a past and a future the notion of the world at an instant the knifeedge present is according to mead an abstraction within the act which may be instrumental in the pursuit of consummation but as a description of concrete experience the knifeedge present is a specious present the specious present is not the actual present of ongoing experience the present in meads words is something that is happening going on movements of thought in the nineteenth century  our experience is always a passing experience and    this passing experience always involves an extension into other experiences it is what has just happened what is going on what is just appearing in the future that gives to our experience its peculiar character it is never an experience just at an instant there is no such thing as the experience of a bare instant as such movements of thought in the nineteenth century  human experience is fundamentally dynamic and human life is built on a temporal foundation the emergent event is the foundation of novelty in experience this novelty is characteristic not only of the present but also of the past and future the future on the one hand lies beyond the emergent present and the novelty of the future takes the form of the unexpected the emergent event creates a future that comes to us as a surprise the past on the other hand must be reinterpreted in the light of the emergent event the result of such reinterpretation is nothing less than a new past consciousness of the past develops in response to emergent events that alter our sense of temporal relationships we find that each generation has a different history that it is a part of the apparatus of each generation to reconstruct its history a different caesar crosses the rubicon not only with each author but with each generation that is as we look back over the past it is a different past the experience is something like that of a person climbing a mountain as he looks back over the terrain he has covered it presents a continually different picture so the past is continually changing as we look at it from the point of view of different authors different generations it is not simply the future and present which is novel then the past is also novel movements of thought in the nineteenth century  history is the reconstruction of the past in response to a new present that opens toward a new future this emphasis on the novelty of human experience pervades meads thought science according to mead thrives on novelty scientific inquiry is in essence a response to exceptions to laws while science on the one hand defines knowledge as finding uniformities finding rules laws movements of thought in the nineteenth century  it also on the other hand seeks to upset all uniformities rules and laws through the quest for novelty scientific inquiry arises out of the conflict between what was expected to happen and what actually happens contradictions in experience are the starting points for the scientific reconstruction of knowledge mead selected writings  science for mead is a continual reconstruction of our conception of the world in response to novel situations meads slogan for science is the law is dead long live the law movements of thought in the nineteenth century  science is a form of human existence a way of moving with the changes that emerge before us science is essentially a method a way of understanding the world movements of thought in the nineteenth century  history is the science of the human past historical inquiry presents the past on the basis of actual documents and their interpretation in terms of historical criticism movements of thought in the nineteenth century  but the historical past as we have seen is not independent of present and future historical inquiry like scientific inquiry in general takes place in a present that has become problematic through the occurrence of an emergent event an ancient village is unearthed in asia minor and the rise of human civilization is suddenly pushed back five thousand years in time the demand on the part of africanamericans for liberty and identity leads to a revaluation of black culture in terms of its historical roots in meads conception of historical method the past is in the present and becomes meaningful in the present as tonness has suggested the past is not a metaphysical reality accessible to present activity but an epistemological reference system which gives coherence to the emerging present  historical thought reconstructs the past continually in an attempt to reveal the cognitive significance of present and future it is not only the content of the past that is subject to change past events have meanings that are also changed as novel events emerge in ongoing experience the meaning of past events is determined by the relation of those events to a present the elucidation of such meaning is the task of historical thought and inquiry an historical account as we have seen is true to the extent that the present is rendered coherent by reference to past events historical thought reinterprets the past in terms of the present but this reinterpretation is not capricious the historical past arises in the reexamination and representation of evidence historical accounts must be documented no historical account however is final the meaning of the past is always open to question any given interpretation of the past may be criticized from the standpoint of a different interpretation historical truth in meads view is relative truth the meaning of the past changes as present slides into present the philosophy of the present  and as different individuals and groups are confronted with new situations that demand a temporal reintegration of experience a new present suggests a new future and demands a new past this interdependence of past present and future is the essential character of human temporality and of historical consciousness b history and selfconsciousness in movements of thought in the nineteenth century mead offers the romantic movement of the late th and th centuries as an example of the present and future orientation of human inquiries into the past meads description of the romantics reconstruction of selfconsciousness on the basis of a reconstructed past is a concrete illustration of his conception of historical consciousness as developing with reference to a problematic present the romantic historians and philosophers confronted with the disruption of experience which was the result of the early modern revolutionary period turned to the medieval past in an effort to redefine the historical and cultural identity of european man the major characteristic of romantic thought according to mead was an attempt to redefine european self consciousness through the reappropriation of the historical past it was the essence of the romantic movement to return to the past from the point of view of the selfconsciousness of the romantic period to become aware of itself in terms of the past movements of thought in the nineteenth century   the european had been cut off from his past by the political and cultural revolutions of the th th and th centuries and in the postrevolutionary world of the early th century the romantic movement represented the european quest for a reconstructed identity it was history that provided the basis for this reconstruction the revolt of reason against authority the idea of rationality has played a central role in modern social theory the revolt against arbitrary authority came on the basis of a description of human nature as having in it a rational principle from which authority could proceed movements of thought in the nineteenth century  thus the aim of modern social theory has been to root social institutions in human nature rather than in divine providence the doctrine of the rights of man and the idea of the social contract for example were brought together by hobbes locke and rousseau in an effort to ground political order in a purely human world society was conceived as a voluntary association of individuals and the aim of this association was the preservation of natural rights to such goods as life liberty and property social authority then was derived from the individuals who had contracted to live together and to pursue certain human goals this analysis of society was at the root of the revolutionary social criticism of the eighteenth century when men came to conceive the order of society as flowing from the rational character of society itself when they came to criticize institutions from the point of view of their immediate function in preserving order and criticized that order from the point of view of its purpose and function when they approached the study of the state from the point of view of political science then of course they found themselves in opposition to the medieval attitude which accepted its institutions as given by god to the church movements of thought in the nineteenth century  but the outcome of the revolution according to mead was not what the philosophers of the age of reason had expected the institutions of the medieval past eg monarchy theocracy economic feudalism were either eliminated or severely limited in their scope and power but the new regime contained reactionary elements of its own the victorious bourgeoisie began to build a new class society based on the dialectic of capital and labor and in this new society the rights of man came to be conceived in terms of the successful struggle for economic power movements of thought in the nineteenth century  each man came to be viewed as an economic unit and the freedom of man became the freedom to compete for profits in the market movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the initial effects of the rise of capitalist society were disastrous for the working classes when labor was brought into the factory centers there sprang up great cities in which men and women lived in almost impossible conditions and there sprang up factories built around the machine in which men women and children worked under ever so hideous conditions movements of thought in the nineteenth century  this situation was rationalized by an ideology that defined human rights in terms of economic competition and that regarded industry as that which provided the morale of a laborer community movements of thought in the nineteenth century  under such conditions the rights and liberties for which the revolution had been fought became more ideological than real it was only after the subsequent rise of the trade union and socialist movements that the contradiction between ideology and reality began to be transcended while the revolution was at least partially fulfilled in england and america it was from the standpoint of the early nineteenth century a total failure on the european continent the french revolution deteriorated into a period of political terror that laid the foundation for the emergence of napoleons imperialism the ideals of liberty equality and fraternity proved inadequate as bases for a fully rational society these ideals in meads view are politically naive the concept of freedom is negative it is a demand that the individual shall be free from restraint movements of thought in the nineteenth century  in the actual political world where there is a conflict of wills the concept of freedom falls into contradiction with itself the freedom of one individual or group often infringes upon the freedom of another individual or group movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the concept of equality which demands that each person shall have    the same political and perhaps economic standing as every other person movements of thought in the nineteenth century  is also far removed from the actual conditions of political and economic life according to mead any society is a complex organization of many individuals and groups these individuals and groups possess varying degrees of power and prestige given this situation the concept of equality is at most an ideal to be pursued but it is not a description of what goes on the in the concrete social world similarly the ideal of fraternity the idea of the comradeship of all humanity is much too vague to be made the basis for the organization of the state the concept of fraternity ignores the fact that all too often people have to depend upon their sense of hostility to other persons in order to identify themselves with their own group movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the ideals of liberty equality and fraternity are from meads standpoint abstract ideals that could not survive the postrevolutionary struggles for political supremacy and the control of property the romantic movement emerged in the aftermath of the failure of the revolution there came a sense of defeat after the breakdown of the revolution after the failure to organize a society on the basis of liberty equality and fraternity and it is out of this sense of defeat that a new movement arose a movement which in general terms passes under the title of romanticism movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the failure of the revolution left europe in confusion the europeans ties to his medieval past had been severed but his revolutionary hopes had not been realized he was caught between two worlds he could not be sure of his identity his sense of self was in crisis the romantic movement was an attempt to overcome this crisis by returning to and reconstructing the european past romanticism then was an effort to reestablish the continuity between the past present and future of european culture romantic selfconsciousness the romantic conception of the self was an outgrowth of kants critique of associationism what took place in the romantic period along a philosophical line was to take this the transcendental unity of apperception which was for kant a bare logical function together with the postulation of the self which we could not possibly know but which kant said we could not help assuming and compose them into the new romantic self movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantic self however was not conceived of as transcendental the romantics did not postulate the self they asserted it as something which is directly given in experience movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantics agreed with kant that the self is the basis of all knowledge and judgment but while the kantian self had been developed as a regulative concept in the attempt to render experience intelligible the romantic self was held to be actually constitutive of experience the romantics mead argues established the existence of our self as the primary fact that is what we insist upon that is what gives the standard to values in that situation the self puts itself forward as its ultimate reality movements of thought in the nineteenth century  thus for the romantics knowledge of the self was not only possible but was viewed as the highest form of knowledge at the heart of the romantic preoccupation with selfconsciousness was the question of the relation between subject and object this question we have seen is also a central concern in meads ontology and epistemology philosophically the romantic analysis of the subject object relation arose in relation to what mead calls the ageold problem of knowledge how can one get any assurance that that which appears in our cognitive experience is real movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the early modern revolt of reason against authority had ended in a skepticism which mead writes shattered all the statements all the doctrines of the medieval philosophy it had even torn to pieces the philosophy of the renaissance it had with humes analysis of causation shattered the natural structure of the world which the renaissance science had presented in such simplicity and yet such majesty that causal structure that led kant to say that there were two things that overwhelmed him the starry heavens above and the moral law within movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantics were reacting against this skeptical attitude they approached the problem of knowledge from the standpoint of the self the self for the romantics was the precondition of experience and experience therefore including the experience of objects was to be understood in relation to the self the epistemological problem of romantic philosophy was to assimilate the notself to the self to encompass the objective world within the subjective world to make the universe atlarge an intimate part of selfconsciousness selfconsciousness as was pointed out above operates in the reflexive mode in self consciousness the self appears as both subject and object we can be conscious of our consciousness mead points out that this reflexivity of consciousness is the foundation of descartes affirmation of the existence of the self but romantic selfconsciousness goes beyond the cartesian cogito in observing that the self does not exist except in relation to something else movements of thought in the nineteenth century  self implies notself subject implies object for every subject there is an object and for every object there is a subject there cannot be one without the other movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the latter insight of romantic thought is reflected in a different form in meads doctrine of perspectives the romantic view of the object as a constitutive element in experience marks a movement away from cartesian subjectivism and toward the objectification of experience that occurs in meads perspectivism for descartes i am conscious and therefore exist for the romanticist i am conscious of myself and therefore this self of which i am conscious exists and with it the objects it knows the object of knowledge in this mode at least is given as there with the same assurance that the thinker is given in the action of thought movements of thought in the nineteenth century  romanticism then as mead presents it is not an extreme subjectivism the romantic attitude is rather the externalizing of the self one projects ones self into the world sees the world through the guise the veil of ones own emotions that is the essential feature of the romantic attitude movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the world exists in relation to the self but the world is objectively there as a necessary structure of human experience self and notself subject and object are not contradictories but dialectical polarities another aspect of romantic selfconsciousness is the view that the self is a dynamic process the polarity of self and notself is not a static structure but an ongoing relationship something that is going on movements of thought in the nineteenth century the very existence of the self mead writes implies a notself it implies a notself which can be identified with the self you have seen that the term self is a reflexive affair it involves an attitude of separation of the self from itself both subject and object are involved in the self in order that it may exist the self must be identified in some sense with the notself it must be able to come back at itself from the outside the process then as involved in the self is the subjectobject process a process within which both of these phases of experience lie a process in which these different phases can be identified with each other — not necessarily as the same phase but at least as expressions of the same process movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the upshot of this point of view according to mead is an activist or pragmatic conception of mind and knowledge knowing is a process involving the interaction of self and notself knowledge is a result of a process in which the self takes action with reference to the notself in which the notself is appropriated by the self in this analysis of the romantic epistemology the germ of meads own philosophy of the act is apparent the interaction of self and notself is the foundation not only of our knowledge of the world but also of our knowledge of the self selfconsciousness requires the objectification of the self the romantic elucidation of the polarity of self and notself makes selfobjectification and therefore self consciousness theoretically comprehensible in action toward the notself selfdiscovery becomes possible the world according to mead is organized only in so far as one acts in it its meaning lies in the conduct of the individual and when one has built up his world as such a field of action then he realizes himself as the individual who carried out that action that is the only way in which he can achieve a self one does not get at himself simply by turning upon himself the eye of introspection one realizes himself in what he does in the ends which he sets up and in the means he takes to accomplish those ends movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the world is a field of action in this field there are tasks to be accomplished and it is through the accomplishing of tasks through the appropriation of the notself by the self that the self is enlarged and actualized thus in meads analysis philosophical romanticism provides a theoretical description of the conditions under which selfconsciousness is possible the fundamental condition of selfconsciousness as we have seen is self objectification however for mead the basic process of selfobjectification takes place in interpersonal experience we have to realize ourselves by taking the role of another playing the part of another taking the attitude of the community toward ourselves continually seeing ourselves as others see us regarding ourselves from the standpoint of those about us this is not the self consciousness that goes with awkwardness and uneasiness it is the assured recognition of ones own position ones social relations that comes from being able to take the attitude of others toward ourselves movements of thought in the nineteenth century  this interpretation of self consciousness which is the essence of meads theory of the self has its roots in the romantic analysis of the relation between self and notself history and romantic selfconsciousness there is a close connection between historical consciousness and self consciousness in romantic thought the romantic movement arose out of the failure of the bourgeois revolution the hopes of the age of reason had not been realized and the european was faced with a crisis in his sense of historical identity romantic consciousness mead argues was a discouraged consciousness in reaction to a disappointing present the romantics looked back to the middle ages for a model of life that carried with it a certain security but the bourgeois revolution for all its failures had created a new concept of the individual post revolutionary man looked at himself as having his own rights regarded himself as having his own feet to stand on in the romantic period european man experienced himself as an individual this gave him a certain independence which he did not have before it gave him a certain self consciousness that he never had before movements of thought in the nineteenth century  thus europe discovered the medieval period in the romantic period     but it also discovered itself in fact it discovered itself first furthermore it discovered the apparatus by means of which this selfdiscovery was possible the self belongs to the reflexive mode one senses the self only in so far as the self assumes the role of another so that it becomes both subject and object in the same experience this is the thing of great importance in this whole historical movement movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantic view of the middle ages then arose with reference to a problematic present and constituted an attempt on the part of european man to reconstruct the continuity of his experience this reconstruction of historical time — which is as suggested above a collective time — resulted in the creation of a new sense of collective identity the romantic conception of the medieval past developed as an effort to redefine the self european man had in a sense lost his self and he turned to history in an attempt to recapture his sense of continuity what the romantic period revealed then was not simply a past but a past as the point of view from which to come back upon the self one has to grow into the attitude of the other come back to the self to realize the self      movements of thought in the nineteenth century  romanticism in meads view is a reconstruction of the self through the selfs assuming the roles of the great figures of the past movements of thought in the nineteenth century  in placing oneself at the standpoint of others in the past one can view oneself in a new light here mead reveals still another form of experience — historical experience — in which the self might be objectified that is the self looked back at is own past as it found it in history it looked back at it and gave the past a new form as that out of which it had sprung it put itself back into the past it lived over again the adventures and achievements of those old heroes with an interest which children have for the lives of their parents — taking their roles and realizing not only the past but the present itself in that process movements of thought in the nineteenth century  in the romantic search for the historical connections between past and present a new past was created and with it a new sense of how the present had grown out of the past emerged history viewed from the standpoint of romantic selfconsciousness became the description of an organized past which rendered the problematic present of the romantic period intelligible romantic self consciousness turned to the past reconstructed the past and made the past one of the main foundations of the self romantic selfconsciousness was thereby expanded and deepened through historical consciousness we might say that the romantic movement reconstructed western selfconsciousness through a reconstruction of western historical consciousness the bourgeois revolution had sundered the connection between the past and present of early th century europe and had left the future in question it was the task of the romantic movement to redefine european self consciousness by way of a reconstruction of the continuity of historical time in so doing the romantic movement revealed the presentdirectedness and future directedness of historical consciousness and developed by the way an historically significant conception of the self as rooted in the experience of time c history and the idea of the future the idea of evolution is central in meads philosophy for mead experience is fundamentally processual and temporal experience is the undergoing of change meads entire ontology is an expression of evolutionary thinking his concept of realityas process is ecological in structure and dynamic in content nature is a system of systems a multiplicity of transacting fields and centers of activity the relation between organism and environment percipient event and consentient set is mutual and dynamic both organism and environment are active the activity of the organism alters the environment and the activity of the environment alters the organism there is no way of separating the two in reality no way of telling which is primary and which secondary thus meads employment of the concept of evolution is an aspect of his attempt to avoid the behavioristic and environmentalist determinism that would regard the organism as passive and as subject to the caprices of nature history as evolution meads concept of evolution is stated in social terms in meads ontology the entire realm of nature is described as social the ontological principle of sociality is a fundamentally evolutionary concept that describes reality as a process in which percipient events adjust to new situations and adapt themselves to a variety of consentient sets mind as an emergent in the social act of communication lies inside of a process of conduct movements of thought in the nineteenth century  and is temporally structured reflective intelligence is the peculiarly human way of overcoming the conflicts in experience it is called into play when action is inhibited and it has reference to a future situation in which the inhibition is overcome mind self and society  and since as we have seen the reconstruction of the past is an important element in the temporal organization of human action historical consciousness becomes a significant instrument in the human evolutionary process historical thought redefines the present in terms of a reinterpreted and reconstructed past and thereby facilitates passage into the future human existence then is described by mead in terms of evolution temporality and historicity human life involves a constant reconstruction of reality with reference to changing conditions and newly emergent situations this process of evolutionary reconstruction according to mead is evident in institutional change the historical consciousness fostered by the romantic movement has permitted us to view human institutions as structures which arose in a process and which simply expressed that process at a certain moment movements of thought in the nineteenth century  for mead the ideas of process and structure do not exclude each other but are related dialectically in actual historical developments historical thought then becomes one way of getting into the structure the movement the current of the process movements of thought in the nineteenth century  historical consciousness is a way of comprehending change but it is also a way of fostering change that is by comprehending the direction of historical change one can place oneself within a given current of change and pursue the historical success of that current in this way the historically minded individual or group can contribute to the development of new structures within the process of time this as mead points out is a way of carrying over revolution into evolution movements of thought in the nineteenth century  meads conception of historical consciousness is rooted in his view of intelligence as the reconstruction of human experience in response to new situations as has been shown earlier mead views the novel event as the basis of intelligent conduct if there were no new situations our conduct would be entirely habitual     conscious beings are those that are continually adjusting themselves using their past experience reconstructing their methods of conduct     that is what intelligence consists in not in finding out once and for all what the order of nature is and then acting in certain prescribed forms but rather in continual readjustment movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the historical resort to the past has reference to new situations that emerge in a present and that suggest a future human thought including historical consciousness is a confrontation with novelty and is aimed at passing from a problematic present to a nonproblematic future and the past is called in and reconstructed in relation to this project of coming to grips with the novelty of experience when what emerges is novel the explanation of this novelty is sought in an order of events in the past which was not previously recognized mead relative spacetime and simultaneity  historical consciousness as we have seen in the case of the romantic movement is instrumental in redefining and maintaining the temporal continuity of human experience novelty for mead is the foundation of consciousness intelligence and the freedom of conduct it is the ground of human experience as far as experience is concerned if everything novel were abandoned experience itself would cease movements of thought in the nineteenth century  human experience is temporal and as such it involves the continual appearance of that which is new thus we are always advancing into a future which is different from the past movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the future is open and in acting toward the future man becomes an active agent in the formulation of his own existence although reality always exists in a present the telos of this reality is to be found in the future in meads view the future is a factor perhaps the main factor in directing our conduct it is the nature of intelligent conduct to be futuredirected we are moving on in the very nature of the case in a process in which the past is moving into the present and into the future movements of thought in the nineteenth century  humandirectednesstowardthefuture is the foundation of freedom the mechanistic view of the world is inadequate as an account of freedom in fact mechanism since it denies the possibility of final causes and attempts to explain everything in terms of efficient causes must deny the possibility of freedom and yet the essence of conduct is that it is directed toward goals ends which while not yet actual are operative in the determination of the directions which conduct shall take movements of thought in the nineteenth century  goals unlike efficient causes are selected by the organism and our selection of goals is not explicable or predictable on the basis of efficient causes thus the interpenetration of experience does go into the future the essence of reality involves the future as essential to itself     the coming of the future into our conduct is the very nature of our freedom movements of thought in the nineteenth century  human action is action toward the future the past does not determine although it does condition human conduct it is rather human conduct that determines the past human action takes place in a present that opens on the future and it is in terms of the emergent present and impending future that the content and meaning of the past are determined human acts are teleological rather than mechanical thus as strauss indicates meads evolutionism permits him to challenge mechanical conceptions of action and the world and to restate problems of autonomy freedom and innovation in evolutionary and social rather than mechanistic and individualistic terms xviii the ideal of history although mead describes human existence as evolving toward an open future that cannot be prefigured with any finality he does not ignore the fact that there are ideals that are operative in directing human action cognizant of social realities and wary of utopian panaceas writes reck resorting to the method of science in questions of morality rather than to authoritative religions or traditional customs aware that men consist of impulses and instincts as well as of intelligence mead nevertheless discerned that there are ideal ends that operate as standards and goals for human conduct introduction xl that many of the ideal ends humans have pursued have been naive that is at odds with the realities of social and political life is clear in meads criticism of the notions of liberty equality and fraternity attempts to convert such ideals into realities have often met with frustration in the ironies of history it is for this reason that mead argues that ideal ends in some sense must be grounded in historical reality otherwise they become either fanciful wishes or mere ideological and rhetorical pronouncements of the many ideals that have influenced human conduct mead selects one for special consideration the ideal of the universal community this ideal has appeared time and again in the history of human thought and is in meads view the ideal or ultimate goal of human social progress mind self and society  the ideal of the universal community is then the ideal of history according to this ideal the goal of history is the establishment of a society in which everyone is going to recognize the interests of everyone else a society in which the golden rule is to be the rule of conduct that is a society in which everyone is to make the interests of others his own interest movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the vision of the universal community is in fact the basis of the philosophy of history as a distinctive form of thought a philosophy of history arose as soon as men conceived that society was moving toward the realization of triumphant ends in some great faroff event it became necessary to relate present conduct and transient values to the ultimate values toward which creation moved the philosophy of the act  this is the eschatological vision that is at the root of the historical conceptions of st paul st augustine hegel marx herbert spencer and as we shall see of mead himself the ideal of the universal community is however an abstraction in as much as it is not actualized in the concrete world in the life of the realities of political and social conflict eg the conflict between private and public interests the ideal of the universal community stands outside of history and yet this ideal is in a sense an historical ideal that is the ideal of the universal community although not explicit in history is according to mead implicit in the historical process the ideal is on the one hand operative in the hopes of mankind and on the other hand it is potentially present in certain concrete historical forces among these historical forces mead finds three of particular importance  the universal religions  universal economic processes and  the process of communication both economic processes and universal religions tend toward a universal community religious and economic attitudes tend potentially toward a social organization which goes beyond the actual structure in which individuals find themselves involved mind self and society  commerce and love are both potentially universalizing ideas and both have been significant factors in the development of human societies the forces of exchange and love know no boundaries all men are included although abstractly in the community of exchange and love although the religious attitude is a more profound form of identifying with others the economic process precisely because of its relative superficiality can travel more rapidly and make possible easier communication it is important to recognize mead writes that these religious and economic developments toward a universal community are going on in history mind self and society  that is the movement toward a universal community is an immanent process and not merely an abstract idea human history seems to imply a universal community a third historical force that implies universality is the process of communication to which mead devotes so much of his attention in his various works language as we have seen is the matrix of social coordination a linguistic gesture is an action which implies a response from another and which is dependent for its meaning on that response the process of communication is a way of gesturing toward others a way of transcending oneself a way of taking the role of another the linguistic act both presupposes and implies a human community of unspecified and unlimited extension language according to mead provides a universal community which is something like the economic community mind self and society  it is through significant communication that the individual is able to generalize her experience to include the experiences of others the world of thought and reason that emerges out of the social act of communication is almost by definition transpersonal and therefore verges toward the universal social organization and social interaction require a commonality of meaning a universe of discourse within which individual acts can take on significance mind self and society  the process of significant communication is the source of this universe of discourse it is meads contention that the thought world created in significant communication constitutes the widest of human communities to date the group defined by the logical universe of discourse is that which is the most general of all human groups — the one that claims the largest number of individual members this group is based on the universal functioning of gestures as significant symbols in the general human social process of communication mind self and society  this universalizing tendency of language comes closer to the realization of the ideal community than do the religious and economic attitudes these latter moreover actually presuppose the communicational process religion and economics organize themselves as social acts on the basis of communication mead thus states the ideal of history in primarily communicational terms the human social ideal    is the attainment of a universal human society in which all human individuals would possess a perfected social intelligence such that all social meanings would each be similarly reflected in their respective individual consciousnesses — such that the meanings of any one individuals acts or gestures as realized by him and expressed in the structure of his self through his ability to take the social attitudes of other individuals toward himself and toward their common social ends or purposes would be the same for any other individual whatever who responded to themmind self and society  meads vision seems to imply a society of many personalities mind self and society  in perfect communication with one another every person would be capable of putting herself into the place of every other person such a system of perfect communication in which the meanings of all symbols are fully transparent would realize the ideal of a universal human community mead recognizes of course how far we are from realizing the universal community our religions our economic systems and our communicational processes are severely limited at present these historical forces separate us as much as they unite us all three for example are conditioned by another historical force which has a fragmenting rather than a universalizing effect on modern culture namely nationalism see mead selected writings   mead points out that the limitation of social organization is found in the inability of individuals to place themselves in the perspectives of others to take their points of view the philosophy of the present  this limitation is far from overcome in contemporary life and the ideal human society cannot exist as long as it is impossible for individuals to enter into the attitudes of those whom they are affecting in the performance of their particular functions mind self and society  contemporary culture is a world culture we all affect each other politically culturally economically nonetheless the actual society in which universality can get its expression has not risen mind self and society  but it is also true that the ideal of the universal community is present by implication in our religions in our economic systems and in our communicational acts the ideal is there as a directive in human history it implies an evolution toward an ideal goal and informs our conduct accordingly meads social idealism is not utopian but historical the ideal of history the ideal of the universal community is an ideal of method not of program it indicates direction not destination the philosophy of the act  and in so far as this ideal informs our actual conduct in the historical world it is a concrete rather than an abstract universal the philosophy of the act  the ideal of history is both transcendent and immanent it is rooted in the past and present but leads into the future which is always awaiting realization historical thought then for mead is instrumental in the evolution of human society it is through the constant reconstruction of experience that human intelligence and human society are expanded meads evolutionary conception of human history is clearly a progressive notion which he seeks to document throughout his writings there is implicit in human history a tendency toward a larger and larger sense of community the ultimate formulation of this historical tendency is found in the ideal of the universal community this ideal is not purely abstract that is extrahistorical but is rooted in actual historical forces such as the universal religions modern economic forces and the human communicational process according to mead it is this ideal of the universal community that informs the human evolutionary process and that

published numerous papers during his lifetime and following his death several of his students produced four books in his name from meads unpublished and even unfinished notes and manuscripts from students notes and from stenographic records of some of his courses at the university of chicago through his teaching writing and posthumous publications mead has exercised a significant influence in th century social theory among both philosophers and social scientists in particular meads theory of the emergence of mind and self out of the social process of significant communication has become the foundation of the symbolic interactionist school of sociology and social psychology in addition to his well known and widely appreciated social philosophy meads thought includes significant

life george herbert mead was born in south hadley massachusetts on february   and he died in chicago illinois on april   he was the second child of hiram mead d  a congregationalist minister and pastor of the south hadley congregational church and elizabeth storrs billings  george herberts older sister alice was born in  in  the family moved to oberlin ohio where hiram mead became professor of homiletics at the oberlin theological seminary a position he held until his death in  after her husbands death elizabeth storrs billings mead taught for two years at oberlin college and subsequently from  to  served as president of mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts george herbert mead entered oberlin college in  at the age of sixteen and graduated with a ba degree in  while at oberlin mead and his best friend henry northrup castle became enthusiastic students of literature poetry and history and staunch opponents of supernaturalism in literature mead was especially interested in wordsworth shelley carlyle shakespeare keats and milton and in history he concentrated on the writings of macauley buckle and motley mead published an article on charles lamb in the  issue of the oberlin review  upon graduating from oberlin in  mead took a grade school teaching job which however lasted only four months mead was let go because of the way in which he handled discipline problems he would simply dismiss uninterested and disruptive students from his class and send them home from the end of  through the summer of  mead was a surveyor with the wisconsin central rail road company he worked on the project that resulted in the eleven hundred mile railroad line that ran from minneapolis minnesota to moose jaw saskatchewan and which connected there with the canadian pacific railroad line mead earned his ma degree in philosophy at harvard university during the  academic year while majoring in philosophy he also studied psychology greek latin german and french among his philosophy professors were george h palmer  and josiah royce  during this time mead was most influenced by royces romanticism and idealism since mead was later to become one of the major figures in the american pragmatist movement it is interesting that while at harvard he did not study under william james  although he lived in jamess home as tutor to the james children in the summer of  meads friend henry castle and his sister helen had traveled to europe and had settled temporarily in leipzig germany later in the early fall of  mead too went to leipzig in order to pursue a phd degree in philosophy and physiological psychology during the  academic year at the university of leipzig mead became strongly interested in darwinism and studied with wilhelm wundt  and g stanley hall  two major founders of experimental psychology on halls recommendation mead transferred to the university of berlin in the spring of  where he concentrated on the study of physiological psychology and economic theory while mead and his friends the castles were staying in leipzig a romance between mead and helen castle developed and they were subsequently married in berlin on october   prior to george and helens marriage henry castle had married frieda stechner of leipzig and henry and his bride had returned to cambridge massachusetts where henry continued his studies in law at harvard meads work on his phd degree was interrupted in the spring of  by the offer of an instructorship in philosophy and psychology at the university of michigan this was to replace james hayden tufts  who was leaving michigan in order to complete his phd degree at the university of freiburg mead took the job and never thereafter resumed his own phd studies mead worked at the university of michigan from the fall of  through the spring of  he taught both philosophy and psychology at michigan he became acquainted with and influenced by the work of sociologist charles horton cooley  psychologist alfred lloyd and philosopher john dewey  mead and dewey became close personal and intellectual friends finding much common ground in their interests in philosophy and psychology in those days the lines between philosophy and psychology were not sharply drawn and mead was to teach and do research in psychology throughout his career mostly social psychology after  george and helen meads only child henry castle albert mead was born in ann arbor in  when the boy grew up he became a physician and married irene tufts james hayden tufts daughter a psychiatrist in  having completed his phd work at freiburg james hayden tufts received an administrative appointment at the newlycreated university of chicago to help its founding president william rainey harper organize the new university which opened in the fall of  the university of chicago was organized around three main departments semitics chaired by jm powis smith classics chaired by paul shorey and philosophy chaired by john dewey as of  dewey was recommended for that position by tufts and dewey agreed to move from the university of michigan to the university of chicago provided that his friend and colleague george herbert mead was given a position as assistant professor in the chicago philosophy department thus the university of chicago became the new center of american pragmatism which had earlier originated with charles sanders peirce  and william james at harvard the chicago pragmatists were led by tufts dewey and mead dewey left chicago for columbia university in  leaving tufts and mead as the major spokesmen for the pragmatist movement in chicago mead spent the rest of his life in chicago he was assistant professor of philosophy from  associate professor from  and full professor from  until his death in  during those years mead made substantial contributions in both social psychology and philosophy meads major contribution to the field of social psychology was his attempt to show how the human self arises in the process of social interaction especially by way of linguistic communication symbolic interaction in philosophy as already mentioned mead was one of the major american pragmatists as such he pursued and furthered the pragmatist program and developed his own distinctive philosophical outlook centered around the concepts of sociality and temporality see below mrs helen castle mead died on december   george mead was hit hard by her passing and gradually became ill himself john dewey arranged for meads appointment as a professor in the philosophy department at columbia university as of the  academic year but before he could take up that appointment mead died in chicago on april    writings during his morethanyear career mead thought deeply wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in philosophy and psychology however he never published a book after his death several of his students edited four volumes from stenographic records of his social psychology course at the university of chicago from meads lecture notes and from meads numerous unpublished papers the four books are the philosophy of the present  edited by arthur e murphy mind self and society  edited by charles w morris movements of thought in the nineteenth century  edited by merritt h moore and the philosophy of the act  meads carus lectures of  edited by charles w morris notable among meads published papers are the following suggestions towards a theory of the philosophical disciplines  social consciousness and the consciousness of meaning  what social objects must psychology presuppose  the mechanism of social consciousness  the social self  scientific method and the individual thinker  a behavioristic account of the significant symbol  the genesis of self and social control  the objective reality of perspectives the nature of the past  and the philosophies of royce james and dewey in their american setting  twentyfive of meads most notable published articles have been collected in selected writings george herbert mead edited by andrew j reck bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press  most of meads writings and much of the secondary literature thereon are listed in the references and further reading below  social theory a communication and mind in mind self and society  mead describes how the individual mind and self arises out of the social process instead of approaching human experience in terms of individual psychology mead analyzes experience from the standpoint of communication as essential to the social order individual psychology for mead is intelligible only in terms of social processes the development of the individuals self and of his self consciousness within the field of his experience is preeminently social for mead the social process is prior to the structures and processes of individual experience mind according to mead arises within the social process of communication and cannot be understood apart from that process the communicational process involves two phases  the conversation of gestures and  language or the conversation of significant gestures both phases presuppose a social context within which two or more individuals are in interaction with one another mead introduces the idea of the conversation of gestures with his famous example of the dogfight dogs approaching each other in hostile attitude carry on such a language of gestures they walk around each other growling and snapping and waiting for the opportunity to attack     mind self and society  the act of each dog becomes the stimulus to the other dog for his response there is then a relationship between these two and as the act is responded to by the other dog it in turn undergoes change the very fact that the dog is ready to attack another becomes a stimulus to the other dog to change his own position or his own attitude he has no sooner done this than the change of attitude in the second dog in turn causes the first dog to change his attitude we have here a conversation of gestures they are not however gestures in the sense that they are significant we do not assume that the dog says to himself if the animal comes from this direction he is going to spring at my throat and i will turn in such a way what does take place is an actual change in his own position due to the direction of the approach of the other dog mind self and society  emphasis added in the conversation of gestures communication takes place without an awareness on the part of the individual of the response that her gesture elicits in others and since the individual is unaware of the reactions of others to her gestures she is unable to respond to her own gestures from the standpoint of others the individual participant in the conversation of gestures is communicating but she does not know that she is communicating the conversation of gestures that is is unconscious communication it is however out of the conversation of gestures that language or conscious communication emerges meads theory of communication is evolutionary communication develops from more or less primitive toward more or less advanced forms of social interaction in the human world language supersedes but does not abolish the conversation of gestures and marks the transition from nonsignificant to significant interaction language in meads view is communication through significant symbols a significant symbol is a gesture usually a vocal gesture that calls out in the individual making the gesture the same that is functionally identical response that is called out in others to whom the gesture is directed mind self and society  significant communication may also be defined as the comprehension by the individual of the meaning of her gestures mead describes the communicational process as a social act since it necessarily requires at least two individuals in interaction with one another it is within this act that meaning arises the act of communication has a triadic structure consisting of the following components  an initiating gesture on the part of an individual  a response to that gesture by a second individual and  the result of the action initiated by the first gesture mind self and society   there is no meaning independent of the interactive participation of two or more individuals in the act of communication of course the individual can anticipate the responses of others and can therefore consciously and intentionally make gestures that will bring out appropriate responses in others this form of communication is quite different from that which takes place in the conversation of gestures for in the latter there is no possibility of the conscious structuring and control of the communicational act consciousness of meaning is that which permits the individual to respond to her own gestures as the other responds a gesture then is an action that implies a reaction the reaction is the meaning of the gesture and points toward the result the intentionality of the action initiated by the gesture gestures become significant symbols when they implicitly arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse or are supposed intended to arouse in other individuals the individuals to whom they are addressed mind self and society  for example you ask somebody to bring a visitor a chair you arouse the tendency to get the chair in the other but if he is slow to act you get the chair yourself the response to the gesture is the doing of a certain thing and you arouse that same tendency in yourself mind self and society  at this stage the conversation of gestures is transformed into a conversation of significant symbols there is a certain ambiguity in meads use of the terms meaning and significance the question is can a gesture be meaningful without being significant but if the meaning of a gesture is the response to that gesture then there is meaning in the nonsignificant conversation of gestures — the second dog after all responds to the gestures of the first dog in the dog fight and viceversa however it is the conversation of significant symbols that is the foundation of meads theory of mind only in terms of gestures as significant symbols is the existence of mind or intelligence possible for only in terms of gestures which are significant symbols can thinking — which is simply an internalized or implicit conversation of the individual with himself by means of such gestures — take place mind self and society  mind then is a form of participation in an interpersonal that is social process it is the result of taking the attitudes of others toward ones own gestures or conduct in general mind in brief is the use of significant symbols the essence of meads socalled social behaviorism is his view that mind is an emergent out of the interaction of organic individuals in a social matrix mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure mead therefore rejects the traditional view of the mind as a substance separate from the body as well as the behavioristic attempt to account for mind solely in terms of physiology or neurology mead agrees with the behaviorists that we can explain mind behaviorally if we deny its existence as a substantial entity and view it instead as a natural function of human organisms but it is neither possible nor desirable to deny the existence of mind altogether the physiological organism is a necessary but not sufficient condition of mental behavior mind self and society  without the peculiar character of the human central nervous system internalization by the individual of the process of significant communication would not be possible but without the social process of conversational behavior there would be no significant symbols for the individual to internalize the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that the individual realizes her physiological and neurological potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in meads terms is the individualized focus of the communicational process — it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no mind or thought without language and language the content of mind is only a development and product of social interaction mind self and society   thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is an emergent in the dynamic ongoing social process that constitutes human experience mind self and society  b action for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication meads concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of mind self and society is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment there are two models of the act in meads general philosophy  the model of the actassuch ie organic activity in general which is elaborated in the philosophy of the act and  the model of the social act ie social activity which is a special case of organic activity and which is of particular although not exclusive relevance in the interpretation of human experience the relation between the social process of behavior and the social environment is analogous to the relation between the individual organism and the physicalbiological environment mind self and society  the actassuch in his analysis of the actassuch that is organic activity mead speaks of the act as determining the relation between the individual and the environment the philosophy of the act  reality according to mead is a field of situations these situations are fundamentally characterized by the relation of an organic individual to his environment or world the world things and the individual are what they are because of this relation between the individual and his world the philosophy of the act  it is by way of the act that the relation between the individual and his world is defined and developed mead describes the act as developing in four stages  the stage of impulse upon which the organic individual responds to problematic situations in his experience eg the intrusion of an enemy into the individuals field of existence  the stage of perception upon which the individual defines and analyzes his problem eg the direction of the enemys attack is sensed and a path leading in the opposite direction is selected as an avenue of escape  the stage of manipulation upon which action is taken with reference to the individuals perceptual appraisal of the problematic situation eg the individual runs off along the path and away from his enemy and  the stage of consummation upon which the encountered difficulty is resolved and the continuity of organic existence re established eg the individual escapes his enemy and returns to his ordinary affairs the philosophy of the act   what is of interest in this description is that the individual is not merely a passive recipient of external environmental influences but is capable of taking action with reference to such influences he reconstructs his relation to his environment through selective perception and through the use or manipulation of the objects selected in perception eg the path of escape mentioned above the objects in the environment are so to speak created through the activity of the organic individual the path along which the individual escapes was not there in his thoughts or perceptions until the individual needed a path of escape reality is not simply out there independent of the organic individual but is the outcome of the dynamic interrelation of organism and environment perception according to mead is a relation between organism and object perception is not then something that occurs in the organism but is an objective relation between the organism and its environment and the perceptual object is not an entity out there independent of the organism but is one pole of the interactive perceptual process the philosophy of the act  objects of perception arise within the individuals attempt to solve problems that have emerged in his experience problems that are in an important sense determined by the individual himself the character of the individuals environment is predetermined by the individuals sensory capacities the environment then is what it is in relation to a sensuous and selective organic individual and things or objects are what they are in the relationship between the individual and his environment and this relationship is that of conduct ie action the philosophy of the act  the social act while the social act is analogous to the actassuch the abovedescribed model of individual biological activity mind self and society  will not suffice as an analysis of social experience the social organism is not an organic individual but a social group of individual organisms mind self and society  the human individual then is a member of a social organism and his acts must be viewed in the context of social acts that involve other individuals society is not a collection of preexisting atomic individuals as suggested for example by hobbes locke and rousseau but rather a processual whole within which individuals define themselves through participation in social acts the acts of the individual are according to mead aspects of acts that are trans individual for social psychology the whole society is prior to the part the individual not the part to the whole and the part is explained in terms of the whole not the whole in terms of the part or parts mind self and society  thus the social act is a dynamic whole a complex organic process within which the individual is situated and it is within this situation that individual acts are possible and have meaning mead defines the social act in relation to the social object the social act is a collective act involving the participation of two or more individuals and the social object is a collective object having a common meaning for each participant in the act there are many kinds of social acts some very simple some very complex these range from the relatively simple interaction of two individuals eg in dancing in lovemaking or in a game of handball to rather more complex acts involving more than two individuals eg a play a religious ritual a hunting expedition to still more complex acts carried on in the form of social organizations and institutions eg law enforcement education economic exchange the life of a society consists in the aggregate of such social acts it is by way of the social act that persons in society create their reality the objects of the social world common objects such as clothes furniture tools as well as scientific objects such as atoms and electrons are what they are as a result of being defined and utilized within the matrix of specific social acts thus an animal skin becomes a coat in the experience of people eg barbarians or pretenders to aristocracy engaged in the social act of covering andor adorning their bodies and the electron is introduced as a hypothetical object in the scientific communitys project of investigating the ultimate nature of physical reality communication through significant symbols is that which renders the intelligent organization of social acts possible significant communication as stated earlier involves the comprehension of meaning ie the taking of the attitude of others toward ones own gestures significant communication among individuals creates a world of common symbolic meanings within which further and deliberate social acts are possible the specifically human social act in other words is rooted in the act of significant communication and is in fact ordered by the conversation of significant symbols in addition to its role in the organization of the social act significant communication is also fundamentally involved in the creation of social objects for it is by way of significant symbols that humans indicate to one another the object relevant to their collective acts for example suppose that a group of people has decided on a trip to the zoo one of the group offers to drive the others in his car and the others respond by following the driver to his vehicle the car has thus become an object for all members of the group and they all make use of it to get to the zoo prior to this particular project of going to the zoo the car did not have the specific significance that it takes on in becoming instrumental in the zootrip the car was no doubt an object in some other social act prior to its incorporation into the zootrip but prior to that incorporation it was not specifically and explicitly a means of transportation to the zoo whatever it was however would be determined by its role in some social act eg the owners project of getting to work each day etc it is perhaps needless to point out that the decision to go to the zoo as well as the decision to use the car in question as a means of transportation was made through a conversation involving significant symbols the significant symbol functions here to indicate some object or other within the field of social behavior an object of common interest to all the individuals involved in the given social act thus directed toward or upon that object mind self and society  the reality that humans experience is for mead very largely socially constructed in a process mediated and facilitated by the use of significant symbols c self and other the self as social emergent the self like the mind is a social emergent this social conception of the self mead argues entails that individual selves are the products of social interaction and not the logical or biological preconditions of that interaction mead contrasts his social theory of the self with individualistic theories of the self that is theories that presuppose the priority of selves to social process the self is something which has a development it is not initially there at birth but arises in the process of social experience and activity that is develops in the given individual as a result of his relations to that process as a whole and to other individuals within that process mind self and society  meads model of society is an organic model in which individuals are related to the social process as bodily parts are related to bodies the self is a reflective process — ie it is an object to itself for mead it is the reflexivity of the self that distinguishes it from other objects and from the body for the body and other objects are not objects to themselves as the self is it is perfectly true that the eye can see the foot but it does not see the body as a whole we cannot see our backs we can feel certain portions of them if we are agile but we cannot get an experience of our whole body there are of course experiences which are somewhat vague and difficult of location but the bodily experiences are for us organized about a self the foot and hand belong to the self we can see our feet especially if we look at them from the wrong end of an opera glass as strange things which we have difficulty in recognizing as our own the parts of the body are quite distinguishable from the self we can lose parts of the body without any serious invasion of the self the mere ability to experience different parts of the body is not different from the experience of a table the table presents a different feel from what the hand does when one hand feels another but it is an experience of something with which we come definitely into contact the body does not experience itself as a whole in the sense in which the self in some way enters into the experience of the self mind self and society  it is moreover this reflexivity of the self that distinguishes human from animal consciousness mind self and society fn  mead points out two uses of the term consciousness  consciousness may denote a certain feeling consciousness which is the outcome of an organisms sensitivity to its environment in this sense animals in so far as they act with reference to events in their environments are conscious and  consciousness may refer to a form of awareness which always has implicitly at least the reference to an i in it that is the term consciousness may mean self consciousness mind self and society  it is the second use of the term consciousness that is appropriate to the discussion of human consciousness while there is a form of prereflective consciousness that refers to the bare thereness of the world it is reflective or self consciousness that characterizes human awareness the prereflective world is a world in which the self is absent mind self and society  selfconsciousness then involves the objectification of the self in the mode of self consciousness the individual enters as such into his own experience    as an object mind self and society  how is this objectification of the self possible the individual according to mead can enter as an object to himself only on the basis of social relations and interactions only by means of his experiential transactions with other individuals in an organized social environment mind self and society  selfconsciousness is the result of a process in which the individual takes the attitudes of others toward herself in which she attempts to view herself from the standpoint of others the selfasobject arises out of the individuals experience of other selves outside of herself the objectified self is an emergent within the social structures and processes of human intersubjectivity symbolic interaction and the emergence of the self meads account of the social emergence of the self is developed further through an elucidation of three forms of intersubjective activity language play and the game these forms of symbolic interaction that is social interactions that take place via shared symbols such as words definitions roles gestures rituals etc are the major paradigms in meads theory of socialization and are the basic social processes that render the reflexive objectification of the self possible language as we have seen is communication via significant symbols and it is through significant communication that the individual is able to take the attitudes of others toward herself language is not only a necessary mechanism of mind but also the primary social foundation of the self i know of no other form of behavior than the linguistic in which the individual is an object to himself    mind self and society  when a self does appear it always involves an experience of another there could not be an experience of a self simply by itself the plant or the lower animal reacts to its environment but there is no experience of a self     when the response of the other becomes an essential part in the experience or conduct of the individual when taking the attitude of the other becomes an essential part in his behavior — then the individual appears in his own experience as a self and until this happens he does not appear as a self mind self and society  within the linguistic act the individual takes the role of the other ie responds to her own gestures in terms of the symbolized attitudes of others this process of taking the role of the other within the process of symbolic interaction is the primal form of selfobjectification and is essential to self realization mind self and society  it ought to be clear then that the selfasobject of which mead speaks is not an object in a mechanistic billiard ball world of external relations but rather it is a basic structure of human experience that arises in response to other persons in an organic socialsymbolic world of internal and inter subjective relations this becomes even clearer in meads interpretation of playing and gaming in playing and gaming as in linguistic activity the key to the generation of selfconsciousness is the process of roleplaying in play the child takes the role of another and acts as though she were the other eg mother doctor nurse indian and countless other symbolized roles this form of roleplaying involves a single role at a time thus the other which comes into the childs experience in play is a specific other the philosophy of the present  the game involves a more complex form of roleplaying than that involved in play in the game the individual is required to internalize not merely the character of a single and specific other but the roles of all others who are involved with him in the game he must moreover comprehend the rules of the game which condition the various roles mind self and society  this configuration of rolesorganizedaccordingto rules brings the attitudes of all participants together to form a symbolized unity this unity is the generalized other mind self and society  the generalized other is an organized and generalized attitude mind self and society  with reference to which the individual defines her own conduct when the individual can view herself from the standpoint of the generalized other self consciousness in the full sense of the term is attained the game then is the stage of the social process at which the individual attains selfhood one of meads most outstanding contributions to the development of critical social theory is his analysis of games mead elucidates the full social and psychological significance of gameplaying and the extent to which the game functions as an instrument of social control the following passage contains a remarkable piece of analysis what goes on in the game goes on in the life of the child all the time he is continually taking the attitudes of those about him especially the roles of those who in some sense control him and on whom he depends he gets the function of the process in an abstract way at first it goes over from the play into the game in a real sense he has to play the game the morale of the game takes hold of the child more than the larger morale of the whole community the child passes into the game and the game expresses a social situation in which he can completely enter its morale may have a greater hold on him than that of the family to which he belongs or the community in which he lives there are all sorts of social organizations some of which are fairly lasting some temporary into which the child is entering and he is playing a sort of social game in them it is a period in which he likes to belong and he gets into organizations which come into existence and pass out of existence he becomes a something which can function in the organized whole and thus tends to determine himself in his relationship with the group to which he belongs that process is one which is a striking stage in the development of the childs morale it constitutes him a selfconscious member of the community to which he belongs mind self and society  emphasis added the me and the i although the self is a product of sociosymbolic interaction it is not merely a passive reflection of the generalized other the individuals response to the social world is active she decides what she will do in the light of the attitudes of others but her conduct is not mechanically determined by such attitudinal structures there are it would appear two phases or poles of the self  that phase which reflects the attitude of the generalized other and  that phase which responds to the attitude of the generalized other here mead distinguishes between the me and the i the me is the social self and the i is a response to the me mind self and society  the i is the response of the organism to the attitudes of the others the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which one himself assumes mind self and society  mead defines the me as a conventional habitual individual and the i as the novel reply of the individual to the generalized other mind self and society  there is a dialectical relationship between society and the individual and this dialectic is enacted on the intrapsychic level in terms of the polarity of the me and the i the me is the internalization of roles which derive from such symbolic processes as linguistic interaction playing and gaming whereas the i is a creative response to the symbolized structures of the me that is to the generalized other although the i is not an object of immediate experience it is in a sense knowable that is objectifiable the i is apprehended in memory but in the memory image the i is no longer a pure subject but a subject that is now an object of observation selected writings  we can understand the structural and functional significance of the i but we cannot observe it directly — it appears only ex post facto we remember the responses of the i to the me and this is as close as we can get to a concrete knowledge of the i the objectification of the i is possible only through an awareness of the past but the objectified i is never the subject of present experience if you ask then where directly in your own experience the i comes in the answer is that it comes in as a historical figure mind self and society  the i appears as a symbolized object in our consciousness of our past actions but then it has become part of the me the me is in a sense that phase of the self that represents the past that is the alreadyestablished generalized other the i which is a response to the me represents action in a present that is that which is actually going on taking place and implies the restructuring of the me in a future after the i has acted we can catch it in our memory and place it in terms of that which we have done but it is now in the newly emerged present an aspect of the restructured me mind self and society   because of the temporalhistorical dimension of the self the character of the i is determinable only after it has occurred the i is not therefore subject to predetermination particular acts of the i become aspects of the me in the sense that they are objectified through memory but the i as such is not contained in the me the human individual exists in a social situation and responds to that situation the situation has a particular character but this character does not completely determine the response of the individual there seem to be alternative courses of action the individual must select a course of action and even a decision to do nothing is a response to the situation and act accordingly but the course of action she selects is not dictated by the situation it is this indeterminacy of response that gives the sense of freedom of initiative mind self and society  the action of the i is revealed only in the action itself specific prediction of the action of the i is not possible the individual is determined to respond but the specific character of her response is not fully determined the individuals responses are conditioned but not determined by the situation in which she acts mind self and society  human freedom is conditioned freedom thus the i and the me exist in dynamic relation to one another the human personality or self arises in a social situation this situation structures the me by means of intersubjective symbolic processes language gestures play games etc and the active organism as it continues to develop must respond to its situation and to its me this response of the active organism is the i the individual takes the attitude of the me or the attitude of the i according to situations in which she finds herself for mead both aspects of the i and the me are essential to the self in its full expression mind self and society  both community and individual autonomy are necessary to identity the i is process breaking through structure the me is a necessary symbolic structure which renders the action of the i possible and without this structure of things the life of the self would become impossible mind self and society  the dialectic of self and other the self arises when the individual takes the attitude of the generalized other toward herself this internalization of the generalized other occurs through the individuals participation in the conversation of significant symbols that is language and in other socialization processes eg play and games the self then is of great value to organized society the internalization of the conversation of significant symbols and of other interactional symbolic structures allows for the superior coordination of society as a whole and for the increased efficiency of the individual as a member of the group mind self and society  the generalized other internalized in the me is a major instrument of social control it is the mechanism by which the community gains control over the conduct of its individual members mind self and society social control in meads words is the expression of the me over against the expression of the i mind self and society  the genesis of the self in social process is thus a condition of social control the self is a social emergent that supports the cohesion of the group individual will is harmonized by means of a socially defined and symbolized reality with social goals and values in so far as there are social acts writes mead there are social objects and i take it that social control is bringing the act of the individual into relation with this social object the philosophy of the act  thus there are two dimensions of meads theory of internalization  the internalization of the attitudes of others toward oneself and toward one another that is internalization of the interpersonal process and  the internalization of the attitudes of others toward the various phases or aspects of the common social activity or set of social undertakings in which as members of an organized society or social group they are all engaged mind self and society  the self then has reference not only to others but to social projects and goals and it is by means of the socialization process that is the internalization of the generalized other through language play and the game that the individual is brought to assume the attitudes of those in the group who are involved with him in his social activities the philosophy of the act  by learning to speak gesture and play in appropriate ways the individual is brought into line with the accepted symbolized roles and rules of the social process the self is therefore one of the most subtle and effective instruments of social control for mead however social control has its limits one of these limits is the phenomenon of the i as described in the preceding section another limit to social control is presented in meads description of specific social relations this description has important consequences regarding the way in which the concept of the generalized other is to be applied in social analysis the self emerges out of a special set of social relations with all the other individuals involved in a given set of social projects mind self and society  the self is always a reflection of specific social relations that are themselves founded on the specific mode of activity of the group in question the concept of property for example presupposes a community with certain kinds of responses the idea of property has specific social and historical foundations and symbolizes the interests and values of specific social groups mead delineates two types of social groups in civilized communities there are on the one hand concrete social classes or subgroups in which individual members are directly related to one another on the other hand there are abstract social classes or subgroups in which individual members are related to one another only more or less indirectly and which only more or less indirectly function as social units but which afford unlimited possibilities for the widening and ramifying and enriching of the social relations among all the individual members of the given society as an organized and unified whole mind self and society  such abstract social groups provide the opportunity for a radical extension of the definite social relations which constitute the individuals sense of self and which structure her conduct human society then contains a multiplicity of generalized others the individual is capable of holding membership in different groups both simultaneously and serially and may therefore relate herself to different generalized others at different times or she may extend her conception of the generalized other by identifying herself with a larger community than the one in which she has hitherto been involved eg she may come to view herself as a member of a nation rather than as a member of a tribe the self is not confined within the limits of any one generalized other it is true that the self arises through the internalization of the generalized attitudes of others but there is it would appear no absolute limit to the individuals capacity to encompass new others within the dynamic structure of the self this makes strict and total social control difficult if not impossible meads description of social relations also has interesting implications visavis the sociological problem of the relation between consensus and conflict in society it is clear that both consensus and conflict are significant dimensions of social process and in meads view the problem is not to decide either for a consensus model of society or for a conflict model but to describe as directly as possible the function of both consensus and conflict in human social life there are two models of consensusconflict relation in meads analysis of social relations these may be schematized as follows intragroup consensus — extragroup conflict intragroup conflict — extragroup consensus in the first model the members of a given group are united in opposition to another group which is characterized as the common enemy of all members of the first group mead points out that the idea of a common enemy is central in much of human social organization and that it is frequently the major referencepoint of intragroup consensus for example a great many human organizations derive their raison detre and their sense of solidarity from the existence or putative existence of the enemy communists atheists infidels fascist pigs religious fanatics liberals conservatives or whatever the generalized other of such an organization is formed in opposition to the generalized other of the enemy the individual is with the members of her group and against members of the enemy group meads second model that of intragroup conflict and extragroup consensus is employed in his description of the process in which the individual reacts against her own group the individual opposes her group by appealing to a higher sort of community that she holds to be superior to her own she may do this by appealing to the past eg she may ground her criticism of the bureaucratic state in a conception of jeffersonian democracy or by appealing to the future eg she may point to the ideal of all mankind of the universal community an ideal that has the future as its everreceding reference point thus intragroup conflict is carried on in terms of an extragroup consensus even if the consensus is merely assumed or posited this model presupposes meads conception of the multiplicity of generalized others ie the field within which conflicts are possible it is also true that the individual can criticize her group only in so far as she can symbolize to herself the generalized other of that group otherwise she would have nothing to criticize nor would she have the motivation to do so it is in this sense that social criticism presupposes social symbolic process and a social self capable of symbolic reflexive activity in addition to the abovedescribed models of consensusconflict relation mead also points out an explicitly temporal interaction between consensus and conflict human conflicts often lead to resolutions that create new forms of consensus thus when such conflicts occur they can lead to whole reconstructions of the particular social situations that are the contexts of the conflicts eg a war between two nations may be followed by new political alignments in which the two warring nations become allies such reconstructions of society are effected by the minds of individuals in conflict and constitute enlargements of the social whole an interesting consequence of meads analysis of social conflict is that the reconstruction of society will entail the reconstruction of the self this aspect of the social dynamic is particularly clear in terms of meads concept of intragroup conflict and his description of the dialectic of the me and the i as pointed out earlier the i is an emergent response to the generalized other and the me is that phase of the self that represents the social situation within which the individual must operate thus the critical capacity of the self takes form in the i and has two dimensions  explicit self criticism aimed at the me is implicit social criticism and  explicit social criticism is implicit self criticism for example the criticism of ones own moral principles is also the criticism of the morality of ones social world for personal morality is rooted in social morality conversely the criticism of the morality of ones society raises questions concerning ones own moral role in the social situation since self and society are dialectical poles of a single process change in one pole will result in change in the other pole it would appear that social reconstructions are effected by individuals or groups of individuals who find themselves in conflict with a given society and once the reconstruction is accomplished the new social situation generates farreaching changes in the personality structures of the individuals involved in that situation in short writes mead social reconstruction and self or personality reconstruction are the two sides of a single process — the process of human social evolution mind self and society   the temporal structure of human existence the temporal structure of human existence according to mead can be described in terms of the concepts of emergence sociality and freedom emergence and temporality what is the ground of the temporality of human experience temporal structure according to mead arises with the appearance of novel or emergent events in experience the emergent event is an unexpected disruption of continuity an inhibition of passage the emergent in other words constitutes a problem for human action a problem to be overcome the emergent event which arises in a present establishes a barrier between present and future emergence is an inhibition of individual and collective conduct a disharmony that projects experience into a distant future in which harmony may be reinstituted the initial temporal structure of human timeconsciousness lies in the separation of present and future by the emergent event the actor blocked in his activity confronts the emergent problem in his present and looks to the future as the field of potential resolution of conflict the future is a temporally and frequently spatially distant realm to be reached through intelligent action human action is actionintime mead argues out that without inhibition of activity and without the distance created by the inhibition there can be no experience of time further mead believes that without the rupture of continuity there can be no experience at all experience presupposes change as well as permanence without disruption there would be merely the passage of events the philosophy of the act  and mere passage does not constitute change passage is pure continuity without interruption a phenomenon of which humans with the possible exception of a few mystics have precious little experience change arises with a departure from continuity change does not however involve the total obliteration of continuity — there must be a persisting nonpassing content against which an emergent event is experienced as a change the philosophy of the act  experience begins with the problematic continuity itself cannot be experienced unless it is broken that is continuity is not an object of awareness unless it becomes problematic and continuity becomes problematic as a result of the emergence of discontinuous events hence continuity and discontinuity emergence are not contradictories but dialectical polarities mutually dependent levels of reality that generate experience itself the now is contrasted with a then and implies that a background which is irrelevant to the difference between them has been secured within which the now and the then may appear there must be banks within which the stream of time may flow the philosophy of the act  emergence then is a fundamental condition of experience and the experience of the emergent is the experience of temporality emergence sunders present and future and is thereby an occasion for action action moreover occurs in time the human act is infected with time — it aims at the future human action is teleological discontinuity therefore and not continuity in the sense of mere duration or passage is the foundation of timeexperience and of experience itself the emergent event constitutes time ie creates the necessity of time the function of the past in human experience the emergent event is not only a problem for ongoing activity it also constitutes a problem for rationality reason according to mead is the search for causal continuity in experience and in fact must presuppose such continuity in its attempt to construct a coherent account of reality reason must assume that all natural events can be reduced to conditions that make the events possible but the emergent event presents itself as discontinuous as a disruption without conditions it is by means of the reconstruction of the past that the discontinuous event becomes continuous in experience the character of the past is that it connects what is unconnected in the merging of one present into another the nature of the past  in selected writings  the emergent event when placed within a reconstructed past is a determined event but since this past was reconstructed from the perspective of the emergent event the emergent event is also a determining event the philosophy of the present  the emergent event itself indicates the continuities within which the event may be viewed as continuous there is then no question of predicting the emergent for it is by definition and also experientially unpredictable but once the emergent appears in experience it may be placed within a continuity dictated by its own character determination of the emergent is retrospective determination meads conception of time entails a drastic revision of the idea of the irrevocability of the past the past is both irrevocable and revocable the philosophy of the present  there is no sense in the idea of an independent or real past for the past is always formulated in the light of the emerging present it is necessary to continually reformulate the past from the point of view of the newly emergent situation for example the movement for the liberation of africanamericans has led to the discovery of the american blacks cultural past black or africanamerican history is in effect a function of the emergence of the civil rights movement in the late s and early s and the subsequent development of that movement as far as most americans were hitherto concerned there simply was no history of the american black — there was only a history of white europeans which included the history of slavery in america there can be no finality in historical accounts the past is irrevocable in the sense that something has happened but what has happened that is the essence of the past is always open to question and reinterpretation further the irrevocability of the past is found in the extension of the necessity with which what has just happened conditions what is emerging in the future the philosophy of the present  irrevocability is a characteristic of the past only in relation to the demands of a present looking into the future that is to say that even the sense that something has happened arises out of a situation in which an emergent event has appeared as a problem like edmund husserl mead conceives of human consciousness as intentional in its structure and orientation the world of conscious experience is intended meant constituted constructed by consciousness thus objectivity can have meaning only within the domain of the subject the realm of consciousness it is not that the existence of the objective world is constituted by consciousness but that the meaning of that world is so constituted in husserlian language the existence of the objective world is transcendent ie independent of consciousness but the meaning of the objective world is immanent ie dependent on consciousness in meads phenomenology of historical experience then the past may be said to possess an objective existence but the meaning of the past is constituted or constructed according to the intentional concerns of historical thought the meaning of the past what has happened is defined by an historical consciousness that is rooted in a present and that is opening upon a newly emergent future history is founded on human action in response to emergent events action is an attempt to adjust to changes that emerge in experience the telos of the act is the reestablishment of a sundered continuity since the past is instrumental in the reestablishment of continuity the adjustment to the emergent requires the creation of history by looking into the future mead observes society acquired a history the philosophy of the act  and the future orientation of history entails that every new discovery every new project will alter our picture of the past although mead discounts the possibility of a transcendent past that is a past independent of any present he does not deny the possibility of validity in historical accounts an historical account will be valid or correct not absolutely but in relation to a specific emergent context accounts of the past become valid in interpreting the world in so far as they present a history of becoming in the world leading up to that which is becoming today      the philosophy of the present  historical thought is valid in so far as it renders change intelligible and permits the continuation of activity an appeal to an absolutely correct account of the past is not only impossible but also irrelevant to the actual conduct of historical inquiry a meaningful past is a usable past historians are to be sure concerned with the truth of historical accounts ie with the objectivity of the past the historical conscience seeks to reconstruct the past on the basis of evidence and to present an accurate interpretation of the data of history meads point is that all such reconstructions and interpretations of the past are grounded in a present that is opening into a future and that the timeconditioned nature and interests of historical thought made the construction of a purely objective historical account impossible historical consciousness is subjective in the sense that it aims at an interpretation of the past that will be humanly meaningful in the present and in the foreseeable future thus for mead historical inquiry is the imaginativebuthonest intelligentandintelligible reconstruction and interpretation of the human past on the basis of all available and relevant evidence above all the historian seeks to define the meaning of the human past and in that way to make a contribution to humanitys search for an overall understanding of human existence sociality and time the emergent event then is basic to meads theory of time the emergent event is a becoming an unexpected occurrence which in its relation to other events gives structure to time the philosophy of the present  but what is the ontological status of emergence what is its relation to the general structure of reality the possibility of emergence is grounded in meads conception of the relatedness the sociality of natural processes meads philosophy arises from a fundamental ecological vision of the world a vision of the world containing a multiplicity of related systems eg the bee system and the flower system which together form the beeflower system nature is a system of systems or relationships it is not a collection of particles or fragments which are actually separate distinctions for mead are abstractions within fields of activity and all natural objects animate or inanimate exist within systems apart from which the existence of the objects themselves is unthinkable the sense of the organic body arises with reference to external objects and these external objects in turn derive their character from their relation to an organic individual the bodyobject and the physical object arise with reference to each other and it is this relationship in meads view that constitutes the reality of each referent it is over against the surfaces of other things that the outside of the organism arises in experience and then the experiences of the organism which are not in such contacts become the inside of the organism it is a process in which the organism is bounded and other things are bounded as well the philosophy of the act  similarly the resistance of the object to organic pressure is in effect the activity of the object and this activity becomes the inside of the object the inside of the object moreover is not a projection from the organism but is there in the relation between the organism and thing see the philosophy of the present    the relation between organism and object then is a social relation the philosophy of the act  thus the relation between a natural object or event and the system within which it exists is not unidirectional the character of the object on the one hand is determined by its membership in a system but on the other hand the character of the system is determined by the activity of the object or event there is a mutual determination of object and system organism and environment percipient event and consentient set the philosophy of the act  while this mutuality of individual and system is characteristic of all natural processes mead is particularly concerned with the biological realm and lays great emphasis on the interdependence and interaction of organism and environment whereas the environment provides the conditions within which the acts of the organism emerge as possibilities it is the activity of the organism that transforms the character of the environment thus an animal with the power of digesting and assimilating what could not before be digested and assimilated is the condition for the appearance of food in his environment the philosophy of the act  in this respect what the individual is determines what the character of his environment will be the philosophy of the act  the relation of organism and environment is not static but dynamic the activities of the environment alter the organism and the activities of the organism alter the environment the organismenvironment relation is moreover complex rather than simple the environment of any organism contains a multiplicity of processes perspectives systems any one of which may become a factor in the organisms field of activity the ability of the organism to act with reference to a multiplicity of situations is an example of the sociality of natural events and it is by virtue of this sociality this capacity of being several things at once the philosophy of the present  that the organism is able to encounter novel occurrences by moving from one system to another the organism confronts unfamiliar and unexpected situations which because of their novelty constitute problems of adjustment for the organism these emergent situations are possible given the multiplicity of natural processes and given the ability of natural events eg organisms to occupy several systems at once a bee for example is capable of relating to other bees to flowers to bears to little boys albeit with various attitudes but sociality is not restricted to animate events a mountain may be simultaneously an aspect of geography part of a landscape an object of religious veneration the dialectical pole of a valley and so forth the capacity of sociality is a universal character of nature there are then two modes of sociality  sociality characterizes the process of readjustment by which an organism incorporates an emergent event into its ongoing experience this sociality in passage which is given in immediate relation of the past and present constitutes the temporal mode of sociality the philosophy of the present   a natural event is social not only by virtue of its dynamic relationship with newly emergent situations but also by virtue of its simultaneous membership in different systems at any given instant in any given present the location of the object in one system places it in the others as well the philosophy of the present  the object is social not merely in terms of its temporal relations but also in terms of its relations with other objects in an instantaneous field this mode of sociality constitutes the emergent event that is the state of a system at a given instant is the social reality within which emergent events occur and it is this reality that must be adjusted to the exigencies of time thus the principle of sociality is the ontological foundation of meads concept of emergence sociality is the ground of the possibility of emergence as well as the basis on which emergent events are incorporated into the structure of ongoing experience temporality and the problem of freedom when meads theory of the self is placed in the context of his description of the temporality of human existence it is possible to construct an account not only of the reality of human freedom but also of the conditions that give rise to the experience of loss of freedom mead grounds his analysis of human consciousness in the social process of communication and on that foundation makes the other an integral part of self understanding the world in which the self lives then is an inter subjective and interactive world — a populated world containing not only the individual self but also other persons intersubjectivity is to be explained in terms of that meeting of minds which occurs in conversation learning reading and thinking the philosophy of the act  it is on the basis of such sociosymbolic interactions between individuals and by means of the conceptual symbols of the communicational process that the mind and the self come into existence the human world is also temporally structured and the temporality of experience mead argues is a flow that is primarily present the past is part of my experience now and the projected future is also part of my experience now there is hardly a moment when turning to the temporality of my life i do not find myself existing in the now thus it would appear that whatever is for me is now and needless to say whatever is of importance or whatever is meaningful for me is of importance or is meaningful now this is true even if that which is important and meaningful for me is located in the past or in the future existential time is time lived in the now my existence is rooted in a living present and it is within this living present that my life unfolds and discloses itself thus to gain full contact with oneself it is necessary to focus ones consciousness on the present and to appropriate that present that existential situation as ones own this philosophy of the present need not lead to a careless live only for today attitude our past is always with us in the form of memory history tradition etc and it provides a context for the living present we live in the present but also out of the past and to live well now we cannot afford to forget the past a fully meaningful human existence must be lived now but with continual reference to the past we must continue to affirm that which has been good and we must work to eliminate or to avoid that which has been bad moreover a full human existence must be lived not only inthepresentoutofthepast but also in thepresenttowardthefuture the human present opens toward the future today must always be lived with a concern for tomorrow for we are continually moving toward the future whether we like it or not further we are called into this future toward ever new possibilities and we must if we wish to live well develop a right mindfulness which orients our present centered consciousness toward the possibilities and challenges of the impending future but we must live now with reference to both past and future the self as we have seen is characterized in part by its activity the i in response to its world and how the individual is active with respect to his world is through his choices and his awareness of his choices the individual experiences himself as having choices or as being confronted with situations which require choices on his part he does not ordinarily experience himself as being controlled by the world the world presents obstacles to him and yet he experiences himself as being able to respond to these obstacles in a variety even though a finite variety of ways one loses ones freedom even ones selfhood when one is unaware of ones choices or when one refuses to face the fact that one has choices from the standpoint of meads description of the temporality of action and his emphasis on the importance of problematic situations in human experience emergencies or crises in ones life are of the utmost existential significance i am a being that exists in relation to a world as such it is essential that i experience myself as in harmony with the world and if this proves difficult or impossible then i am thrown into a crisis ie i am threatened with separation greek krisis from the world and separation from the world from the standpoint of a being intheworld is tantamount to non being it is in this context that the loss of ones freedom the experience of lost autonomy becomes a real possibility encountering a crisis in the process of life the individual may well experience himself as paralyzed as stuck in his situation as patient rather than as agent of change but it is also the case that the experience of crisis may lead to a deepened sense of ones active involvement in the temporal unfolding of life from meads point of view a crisis is a crucial time or a turningpoint in individual existence negatively it is a threat to the individuals continuity in and with his world positively it is an opportunity to redefine broaden and deepen the individuals sense of self and of the world to which the self is ontologically related thus it would appear that crises may in fact undermine the sense of freedom of choice and yet it is also true that crises constitute opportunities for the exercise of freedom since such breaks or discontinuities in our experience demand that we make decisions as to what we are going to do now in this way breakdowns might be viewed as breakthroughs freedom denied on one level of experience is rediscovered at another one must lose oneself in order to find oneself  perception and reflection meads theory of perspectives meads concept of sociality as we have seen implies a vision of reality as situational or perspectival a perspective is the world in its relationship to the individual and the individual in his relationship to the world the philosophy of the act  a perspective then is a situation in which a percipient event or individual exists with reference to a consentient set or environment and in which a consentient set exists with reference to a percipient event there are obviously many such situations or perspectives these are not in meads view imperfect representations of an absolute reality that transcends all particular situations on the contrary these situations are the reality which is the world the philosophy of the act  distance experience for mead perceptual objects arise within the act and are instrumental in the consummation of the act at the perceptual stage of the act these objects are distant from the perceiving individual they are over there they are not here and not now the distance is both spatial and temporal such objects invite the perceiving individual to act with reference to them to make contact with them thus mead speaks of perceptual objects as plans of action that control the action of the individual the philosophy of the present  and the philosophy of the act  distance experience implies contact experience perception leads on to manipulation the readiness of the individual to make contact with distant objects is what mead calls a terminal attitude terminal attitudes are beginnings of the contact response that will be made to the object when the object is reached the philosophy of the act  such attitudes are those which if carried out into overt action would lead to movements which if persevered in would overcome the distances and bring the objects into the manipulatory sphere the philosophy of the act  a terminal attitude then is an implicit manipulation of a distant object it stands at the beginning of the act and is an intellectualandemotional posture in terms of which the individual encounters the world as present in the beginning of the act the terminal attitude contains the later stages of the act in the sense that perception implies manipulation and in the sense that manipulation is aimed at the resolution of a problem in terminal attitudes all stages of the act interpenetrate within the act then there is a tendency on the part of the perceiving individual to approach distant objects in terms of the values of the manipulatory sphere distant objects are perceived with the dimensions they would have if they were brought within the field in which we could both handle and see them the philosophy of the act  for example a distant shape is seen as being palpable as having a certain size and weight as having such and such a texture and so forth in perception the manipulatory area is extended and the distant object becomes hypothetically a contact object in immediate perceptual experience the distant object is in the future contact with the distant object is implicit ie anticipated the percept according to mead is there as a promise the philosophy of the act  in so far as the act of perception involves terminal attitudes the promise or futurity of the distant object is collapsed into a hypothetical now in which the perceiving individual and the perceptual object exist simultaneously the temporal distance between individual and object is thus suspended this suspension of time permits alternative and perhaps conflicting contact reactions to the object to be tested in imagination thus the act may be completed in abstraction before it is completed in fact in this sense the percept is a collapsed act the philosophy of the act  the contemporaneity of individual and distant object is an abstraction within the act in the collapsed act time is abstracted from space for the purposes of our conduct the philosophy of the present  prior to actual manipulation the perceiving individual anticipates a variety of ways in which a given object might be manipulated this implicit testing of alternative responses to the distant object is the essence of reflective conduct the actual futurity of the distant object is suspended and the object is treated as though it were present in the manipulatory area the time of the collapsed act therefore is an abstracted time that involves the experience of inhibited action in which the goal is present as achieved through the individual assuming the attitude of contact response and thus leaving the events that should elapse between the beginning and the end of the act present only in their abstracted character as passing the philosophy of the act  thus in the abstracted time of the collapsed act certain objects cease to be events cease to pass as they are in reality passing and in their permanence become the conditions of our action and events take place with reference to them the philosophy of the present  the perceiving individuals terminal attitudes constitute an anticipatory contact experience in which the futurity of distant objects is reduced to an abstract contemporaneity this reduction of futurity we have seen is instrumental in the reflective conduct of the acting individual in perception then distant objects are reduced to the manipulatory area and become hypothetically contact objects the fundamentals of perception are the spatiotemporal distances of objects lying outside the manipulatory area and the readiness of the organism to act toward them as they will be if they come within the manipulatory area the philosophy of the act  perception involves the assumption of contact qualities in the distant object the object is removed from its actual temporal position and is incorporated in a permanent space which is actually the space of the manipulatory area hypothetically extended the philosophy of the act  the object which is actually spatiotemporally distant becomes hypothetically and for the purposes of reflective conduct spatiotemporally present it is in the perceiving individuals assumption of the contact attitude both here and now perspectives early modern accounts of perception in an attempt to ground the theories and methods of modern science in a philosophical framework made a distinction between the primary and secondary qualities of objects galileo articulated the latter distinction as follows i feel myself impelled by the necessity as soon as i conceive a piece of matter or corporeal substance of conceiving that in its own nature it is bounded and figured in such and such a figure that in relation to others it is either large or small that it is in this or that place in this or that time that it is in motion or remains at rest     that it is single few or many in short by no imagination can a body be separated from such conditions but that it must be white or red bitter or sweet sounding or mute of a pleasant or unpleasant odour i do not perceive my mind forced to acknowledge it necessarily accompanied by such conditions so if the senses are not the escorts perhaps the reason or the imagination by itself would never have arrived at them hence i think that these tastes odours colors etc on the side of the object in which they seem to exist are nothing but mere names but hold their residence solely in the sensitive body so that if the animal were removed every such quality would be abolished and annihilated quoted by ea burtt the metaphysical foundations of modern physical science doubleday   another way of putting this is to say that the primary qualities of an object are those which are subject to precise mathematical calculation whereas the secondary qualities of the object are those which are rooted in the sensibility of the perceiving organism and which are therefore not objectively quantifiable the primary qualities number position extension bulk and so forth are there in the object but the secondary qualities are subjective reactions to the object on the part of the sensitive organism a corollary of this doctrine is that the primary qualities because they are objective are more knowable than are the subjective secondary qualities a serious breakdown in the theory of primary and secondary qualities appeared in the critical epistemology of george berkeley according to berkeley whatever we know of objects we know on the basis of perception the primary as well as the secondary qualities of objects are apprehended in sensation moreover primary qualities are never perceived except in conjunction with secondary qualities both primary and secondary qualities therefore are derived from perception and are ideas in the mind when we know the primary qualities of an object what we know are our own ideas and sensations thus berkeley calls into question the objectivity of the primary qualities these qualities it would appear are as dependent upon a perceiving organism as are secondary qualities the outcome of berkeleys radical subjectivism which reaches its apogee in the skepticism of hume is an epistemological crisis in which the knowability of the external world is rendered problematic meads account of distance experience offers a description of the experiential basis of the separation of primary and secondary qualities in the exigencies of action we have seen there is a tendency on the part of the acting individual to reduce distant objects to the contact area it is this collapsing of the act according to mead which is responsible for the so called subjective nature of the secondary qualities    of objects the philosophy of the act  the contact characters of the object become the main focus within the act while the distance characters are bracketed out that is held in suspension or ignored for the time being for the purposes of conduct the reality of what we see is what we can handle the philosophy of the act  in meads analysis of perception the distinction between distance and contact characters is roughly equivalent to the traditional distinction between secondary and primary qualities respectively for mead however the distance characters of an object are not subjective but are as objective as the contact characters distance characters such as color sound odor and taste are there in the act they appear in the transition from impulse to perception and are present even in manipulation in the manipulatory area one actually handles the colored odorous sounding sapid object the distance characters seem to be no longer distant and the object answers to a collapsed act the philosophy of the act  meads theory of perspectives is in effect an attempt to make clear the objective intentionality of perceptual experience in meads relational conception of biological existence there is a mutual determination of organism and environment the character of the organism determines the environment just as the character of the environment determines the organism in his opposition to outright environmental determinism mead points out that the sensitivity selectivity and organizational capacities of organisms are sources of the control of the environment by the form on the human level for example we find the phenomenon of attention the human being selects her stimuli and thereby organizes the field within which she acts attention then is characterized by its selectivity and organizing tendency here we have the organism as acting and deter mining its environment it is not simply a set of passive senses played upon by the stimuli that come from without the organism goes out and determines what it is going to respond to and organizes the world mind self and society  attention is the foundation of human intelligence it is the capacity of attention that gives us control over our experience and conduct attention is one of the elements of human freedom the relation between organism and environment is in a word interactive the perceptual object arises within this interactive matrix and is determined by its reference to some percipient event or individual in a consentient set the philosophy of the act  in other words perceptual objects are perspectively determined and perspectives are determined by perceiving individuals even when we consider only sense data the object is clearly a function of the whole situation whose perspective is determined by the individual there are peculiarities in the objects which depend upon the individual as an organism and the spatiotemporal position of the individual it is one of the important results of the modern doctrine of relativity that we are forced to recognize that we cannot account for these peculiarities by stating the individual in terms of his environment the philosophy of the act  the perceiving individual cannot be explained in terms of the socalled external world since that individual is a necessary condition of the appearance of that world mead thus abandons on the basis of his interpretation of relativity theory the object of newtonian physics but in addition to denying the concrete existence of independent objects he also denies the existence of the independent psyche there is nothing subjective about perceptual experience if objects exist with reference to the perceiving individual it is also true that the perceiving individual exists with reference to objects the qualities of objects distance as well as contact qualities exist in the relation between the perceiving individual and the world the socalled secondary sensuous qualities therefore are objectively present in the individualworld matrix sensuous characters are there in a given perspective on reality in actual perceptual experience the object is objectively present in relation to the individual whereas the relation between the world and the perceiving individual led berkeley to a radical subjectification of experience meads relationism leads him to an equally radical objectification of experience perspectives in meads view are objectively real perspectives are there in nature and natural reality is the overall organization of perspectives there is so far as we can directly know no natural reality beyond the organization of perspectives no noumena no independent world of physical particles in absolute space and time the philosophy of the present  the cosmos is nature stratified into a multiplicity of perspectives all of which are interrelated perspectival stratifications of nature are not only there in nature but they are the only forms of nature that are there the philosophy of the present  the scientific object mead distinguishes two main types of perspective  the perceptual perspective and  the reflective perspective a perceptual perspective is rooted in the spacetime world in which action is unreflective this is the world of immediate perceptual experience a reflective perspective is a response to the world of perceptual perspectives the perspectives of fig trees and wasps are from the standpoint of the trees and wasps hypothetically considered perceptually independent except for certain points of intersection that is actual contacts but in the reflective perspective of the man who plants the fig trees and insures the presence of the wasps both lifehistories run their courses and their intersection provides a dimension from which their interconnection maintains their species the philosophy of the act  reflectively the fig tree perspective and the wasp perspective form a single perspective that includes the perspectives of both the philosophy of the act  the world of reflective perspectives is the world of reflective thought and action the world of distance experience and the world of scientific inquiry it is within the reflective perspective that the hypothetical objects of the collapsed act arise since meads conception of distance experience has been discussed earlier the present analysis will concentrate on the emergence of the scientific object in reflective experience corresponding to the two types of perspective outlined above are two attitudes toward the perceptual objects which arise in experience there is first and corresponding to the perceptual perspective the attitude of immediate experience which is grounded in the world that is there the philosophy of the act  the world that is there a phrase mead uses over and over again includes our own acts our own bodies and our own psychological responses to the things that emerge in our ongoing activity perceptual objects in the world that is there are what they appear to be in their relation to the perceiving individual the second attitude toward perceptual objects is that of reflective analysis which attempts to set forth the preconditions of perceptual experience this attitude corresponds to the reflective perspective it is through reflective analysis of perceptual objects that scientific objects are constructed examples of scientific objects are the newtonian notions of absolute space and absolute time the concept of the world at an instant absolute simultaneity the notion of ultimate elements atoms electrons particles and so on such objects according to mead are hypothetical abstractions which arise in the scientific attempt to explain the world of immediate experience the whole tendency of the natural sciences as exhibited especially in physics and chemistry is to replace the objects of immediate experience by hypothetical objects which lie beyond the range of possible experience the philosophy of the act  scientific objects are not objects of experience science accounts for the perceptible in terms of the non perceptible and often the imperceptible there is a danger in the reflective analysis of the world that is there namely the reification of scientific objects and the subjectification of perceptual objects that is it is possible to conceive of the perceptual world as a product of organic sensitivity including human consciousness while the world of scientific objects is conceived of as entirely independent of perceiving individuals the philosophy of the act   according to mead this formulation of the relation between scientific objects and perceptual objects is entirely uncritical the philosophy of the act  the alleged separation of scientific and perceptual objects leads to a bifurcated nature in which experience is cut off from reality through the dualism of primary and secondary qualities meads critique of the latter doctrine discussed above reveals that the organism is a part of the physical world we are explaining the philosophy of the act  and that the perceptual object with all of its qualities is objectively there in the relation between organism and world the scientific object moreover has ultimate reference to the perceptual world the act of reflective analysis within which the scientific object arises presupposes the world that is there in perceptual experience scientific objects are abstractions within the reflective act and are in effect attempts to account for the objects of perceptual experience and it is to the world that is there that the scientist must go to confirm or disconfirm the hypothetical objects of scientific theory reflective analysis thus arises within and presupposes an unreflective world of immediate experience and it is this immediate world which is the final test of the reality of scientific hypotheses as well as the test of the truth of all our ideas and suppositions mind self and society  in mind self and society mead refers to the unreflective world as the world of the biologic individual the term he points out refers to the individual in an attitude and at a moment in which the impulses sustain an unfractured relation with the objects around him     i have termed it biologic because the term lays emphasis on the living reality which may be distinguished from reflection a later reflection turns back upon it and endeavors to present the complete interrelationship between the world and the individual in terms of physical stimuli and biological mechanisms scientific objects the actual experience did not take place in this hypothetical form but in the form of unsophisticated reality mind self and society   emphasis added the world that is there is prior to the reflective world of scientific theory the reification of scientific objects at the expense of perceptual experience is in meads view the product of an uncritical scientific imagination the philosophy of the act  meads analysis of the scientific object is an attempt to establish the actual relation between reflective analysis and perceptual experience his aim is to demonstrate the objective reality of the perceptual world he does not however deny the reality of scientific objects scientific objects are hypothetical objects which are real in so far as they render the experiential world intelligible and controllable harold n lee in discussing meads philosophy points out that the task of science is to understand the world we live in and to enable us to act intelligently within it it is not to construct a new and artificial world except in so far as the artificial picture aids in understanding and controlling the world we live in the artificial picture is not be substituted for the world lee  emphasis added scientific knowledge is not final but hypothetical and the reality of scientific objects is therefore hypothetical rather than absolute reflective conduct takes place with reference to problems that emerge in the world that is there and the construction of scientific objects is aimed at solving these problems problematic situations occur within the world that is there it is not the entire world of experience that becomes problematic but only aspects of that world and while the scientific attitude is ready to question everything it does not question everything at once selected writings  the scientist according to mead always deals with an actual problem he does not question the whole world of meaning but only that part of the world which has come into conflict with accepted doctrine the unquestioned aspects of the world form the necessary field without which no conflict can arise the possible calling in question of any content whatever it may be means always that there is left a field of unquestioned reality selected writings  it is to this field of unquestioned reality that the scientist returns to test his reconstructed theory the world of the scientist is always there as one in which reconstruction is taking place with continual shifting of problems but as a real world within which the problems arise selected writings  emphasis added  philosophy of history a the nature of history history according to mead is the collective time of the social act historical thought arises in response to emergent events crises new situations unexpected disruptions that are confronted in community life meads general description of experiential time holds with reference to the time of historical experience the continuity of experience is rendered problematic by the emergent event present and future are cut off from each other and the past both in terms of its content and of its meaning is called into question the past is reconstructed in such a way that the emergent event is seen as continuous with the past in this manner the present difficulty becomes intelligible and the emergent discontinuity of experience is potentially resolvable historical thought is a reconstruction of a communal past in an attempt to understand the nature and significance of a communal present and a potential communal future historical accounts are never final since historical thought continually restates the past in terms of newly emergent situations in a present that opens upon a future human life is an ongoing process that is temporally structured the existential present the now within which we act is dynamic and implies a past and a future the notion of the world at an instant the knifeedge present is according to mead an abstraction within the act which may be instrumental in the pursuit of consummation but as a description of concrete experience the knifeedge present is a specious present the specious present is not the actual present of ongoing experience the present in meads words is something that is happening going on movements of thought in the nineteenth century  our experience is always a passing experience and    this passing experience always involves an extension into other experiences it is what has just happened what is going on what is just appearing in the future that gives to our experience its peculiar character it is never an experience just at an instant there is no such thing as the experience of a bare instant as such movements of thought in the nineteenth century  human experience is fundamentally dynamic and human life is built on a temporal foundation the emergent event is the foundation of novelty in experience this novelty is characteristic not only of the present but also of the past and future the future on the one hand lies beyond the emergent present and the novelty of the future takes the form of the unexpected the emergent event creates a future that comes to us as a surprise the past on the other hand must be reinterpreted in the light of the emergent event the result of such reinterpretation is nothing less than a new past consciousness of the past develops in response to emergent events that alter our sense of temporal relationships we find that each generation has a different history that it is a part of the apparatus of each generation to reconstruct its history a different caesar crosses the rubicon not only with each author but with each generation that is as we look back over the past it is a different past the experience is something like that of a person climbing a mountain as he looks back over the terrain he has covered it presents a continually different picture so the past is continually changing as we look at it from the point of view of different authors different generations it is not simply the future and present which is novel then the past is also novel movements of thought in the nineteenth century  history is the reconstruction of the past in response to a new present that opens toward a new future this emphasis on the novelty of human experience pervades meads thought science according to mead thrives on novelty scientific inquiry is in essence a response to exceptions to laws while science on the one hand defines knowledge as finding uniformities finding rules laws movements of thought in the nineteenth century  it also on the other hand seeks to upset all uniformities rules and laws through the quest for novelty scientific inquiry arises out of the conflict between what was expected to happen and what actually happens contradictions in experience are the starting points for the scientific reconstruction of knowledge mead selected writings  science for mead is a continual reconstruction of our conception of the world in response to novel situations meads slogan for science is the law is dead long live the law movements of thought in the nineteenth century  science is a form of human existence a way of moving with the changes that emerge before us science is essentially a method a way of understanding the world movements of thought in the nineteenth century  history is the science of the human past historical inquiry presents the past on the basis of actual documents and their interpretation in terms of historical criticism movements of thought in the nineteenth century  but the historical past as we have seen is not independent of present and future historical inquiry like scientific inquiry in general takes place in a present that has become problematic through the occurrence of an emergent event an ancient village is unearthed in asia minor and the rise of human civilization is suddenly pushed back five thousand years in time the demand on the part of africanamericans for liberty and identity leads to a revaluation of black culture in terms of its historical roots in meads conception of historical method the past is in the present and becomes meaningful in the present as tonness has suggested the past is not a metaphysical reality accessible to present activity but an epistemological reference system which gives coherence to the emerging present  historical thought reconstructs the past continually in an attempt to reveal the cognitive significance of present and future it is not only the content of the past that is subject to change past events have meanings that are also changed as novel events emerge in ongoing experience the meaning of past events is determined by the relation of those events to a present the elucidation of such meaning is the task of historical thought and inquiry an historical account as we have seen is true to the extent that the present is rendered coherent by reference to past events historical thought reinterprets the past in terms of the present but this reinterpretation is not capricious the historical past arises in the reexamination and representation of evidence historical accounts must be documented no historical account however is final the meaning of the past is always open to question any given interpretation of the past may be criticized from the standpoint of a different interpretation historical truth in meads view is relative truth the meaning of the past changes as present slides into present the philosophy of the present  and as different individuals and groups are confronted with new situations that demand a temporal reintegration of experience a new present suggests a new future and demands a new past this interdependence of past present and future is the essential character of human temporality and of historical consciousness b history and selfconsciousness in movements of thought in the nineteenth century mead offers the romantic movement of the late th and th centuries as an example of the present and future orientation of human inquiries into the past meads description of the romantics reconstruction of selfconsciousness on the basis of a reconstructed past is a concrete illustration of his conception of historical consciousness as developing with reference to a problematic present the romantic historians and philosophers confronted with the disruption of experience which was the result of the early modern revolutionary period turned to the medieval past in an effort to redefine the historical and cultural identity of european man the major characteristic of romantic thought according to mead was an attempt to redefine european self consciousness through the reappropriation of the historical past it was the essence of the romantic movement to return to the past from the point of view of the selfconsciousness of the romantic period to become aware of itself in terms of the past movements of thought in the nineteenth century   the european had been cut off from his past by the political and cultural revolutions of the th th and th centuries and in the postrevolutionary world of the early th century the romantic movement represented the european quest for a reconstructed identity it was history that provided the basis for this reconstruction the revolt of reason against authority the idea of rationality has played a central role in modern social theory the revolt against arbitrary authority came on the basis of a description of human nature as having in it a rational principle from which authority could proceed movements of thought in the nineteenth century  thus the aim of modern social theory has been to root social institutions in human nature rather than in divine providence the doctrine of the rights of man and the idea of the social contract for example were brought together by hobbes locke and rousseau in an effort to ground political order in a purely human world society was conceived as a voluntary association of individuals and the aim of this association was the preservation of natural rights to such goods as life liberty and property social authority then was derived from the individuals who had contracted to live together and to pursue certain human goals this analysis of society was at the root of the revolutionary social criticism of the eighteenth century when men came to conceive the order of society as flowing from the rational character of society itself when they came to criticize institutions from the point of view of their immediate function in preserving order and criticized that order from the point of view of its purpose and function when they approached the study of the state from the point of view of political science then of course they found themselves in opposition to the medieval attitude which accepted its institutions as given by god to the church movements of thought in the nineteenth century  but the outcome of the revolution according to mead was not what the philosophers of the age of reason had expected the institutions of the medieval past eg monarchy theocracy economic feudalism were either eliminated or severely limited in their scope and power but the new regime contained reactionary elements of its own the victorious bourgeoisie began to build a new class society based on the dialectic of capital and labor and in this new society the rights of man came to be conceived in terms of the successful struggle for economic power movements of thought in the nineteenth century  each man came to be viewed as an economic unit and the freedom of man became the freedom to compete for profits in the market movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the initial effects of the rise of capitalist society were disastrous for the working classes when labor was brought into the factory centers there sprang up great cities in which men and women lived in almost impossible conditions and there sprang up factories built around the machine in which men women and children worked under ever so hideous conditions movements of thought in the nineteenth century  this situation was rationalized by an ideology that defined human rights in terms of economic competition and that regarded industry as that which provided the morale of a laborer community movements of thought in the nineteenth century  under such conditions the rights and liberties for which the revolution had been fought became more ideological than real it was only after the subsequent rise of the trade union and socialist movements that the contradiction between ideology and reality began to be transcended while the revolution was at least partially fulfilled in england and america it was from the standpoint of the early nineteenth century a total failure on the european continent the french revolution deteriorated into a period of political terror that laid the foundation for the emergence of napoleons imperialism the ideals of liberty equality and fraternity proved inadequate as bases for a fully rational society these ideals in meads view are politically naive the concept of freedom is negative it is a demand that the individual shall be free from restraint movements of thought in the nineteenth century  in the actual political world where there is a conflict of wills the concept of freedom falls into contradiction with itself the freedom of one individual or group often infringes upon the freedom of another individual or group movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the concept of equality which demands that each person shall have    the same political and perhaps economic standing as every other person movements of thought in the nineteenth century  is also far removed from the actual conditions of political and economic life according to mead any society is a complex organization of many individuals and groups these individuals and groups possess varying degrees of power and prestige given this situation the concept of equality is at most an ideal to be pursued but it is not a description of what goes on the in the concrete social world similarly the ideal of fraternity the idea of the comradeship of all humanity is much too vague to be made the basis for the organization of the state the concept of fraternity ignores the fact that all too often people have to depend upon their sense of hostility to other persons in order to identify themselves with their own group movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the ideals of liberty equality and fraternity are from meads standpoint abstract ideals that could not survive the postrevolutionary struggles for political supremacy and the control of property the romantic movement emerged in the aftermath of the failure of the revolution there came a sense of defeat after the breakdown of the revolution after the failure to organize a society on the basis of liberty equality and fraternity and it is out of this sense of defeat that a new movement arose a movement which in general terms passes under the title of romanticism movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the failure of the revolution left europe in confusion the europeans ties to his medieval past had been severed but his revolutionary hopes had not been realized he was caught between two worlds he could not be sure of his identity his sense of self was in crisis the romantic movement was an attempt to overcome this crisis by returning to and reconstructing the european past romanticism then was an effort to reestablish the continuity between the past present and future of european culture romantic selfconsciousness the romantic conception of the self was an outgrowth of kants critique of associationism what took place in the romantic period along a philosophical line was to take this the transcendental unity of apperception which was for kant a bare logical function together with the postulation of the self which we could not possibly know but which kant said we could not help assuming and compose them into the new romantic self movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantic self however was not conceived of as transcendental the romantics did not postulate the self they asserted it as something which is directly given in experience movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantics agreed with kant that the self is the basis of all knowledge and judgment but while the kantian self had been developed as a regulative concept in the attempt to render experience intelligible the romantic self was held to be actually constitutive of experience the romantics mead argues established the existence of our self as the primary fact that is what we insist upon that is what gives the standard to values in that situation the self puts itself forward as its ultimate reality movements of thought in the nineteenth century  thus for the romantics knowledge of the self was not only possible but was viewed as the highest form of knowledge at the heart of the romantic preoccupation with selfconsciousness was the question of the relation between subject and object this question we have seen is also a central concern in meads ontology and epistemology philosophically the romantic analysis of the subject object relation arose in relation to what mead calls the ageold problem of knowledge how can one get any assurance that that which appears in our cognitive experience is real movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the early modern revolt of reason against authority had ended in a skepticism which mead writes shattered all the statements all the doctrines of the medieval philosophy it had even torn to pieces the philosophy of the renaissance it had with humes analysis of causation shattered the natural structure of the world which the renaissance science had presented in such simplicity and yet such majesty that causal structure that led kant to say that there were two things that overwhelmed him the starry heavens above and the moral law within movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantics were reacting against this skeptical attitude they approached the problem of knowledge from the standpoint of the self the self for the romantics was the precondition of experience and experience therefore including the experience of objects was to be understood in relation to the self the epistemological problem of romantic philosophy was to assimilate the notself to the self to encompass the objective world within the subjective world to make the universe atlarge an intimate part of selfconsciousness selfconsciousness as was pointed out above operates in the reflexive mode in self consciousness the self appears as both subject and object we can be conscious of our consciousness mead points out that this reflexivity of consciousness is the foundation of descartes affirmation of the existence of the self but romantic selfconsciousness goes beyond the cartesian cogito in observing that the self does not exist except in relation to something else movements of thought in the nineteenth century  self implies notself subject implies object for every subject there is an object and for every object there is a subject there cannot be one without the other movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the latter insight of romantic thought is reflected in a different form in meads doctrine of perspectives the romantic view of the object as a constitutive element in experience marks a movement away from cartesian subjectivism and toward the objectification of experience that occurs in meads perspectivism for descartes i am conscious and therefore exist for the romanticist i am conscious of myself and therefore this self of which i am conscious exists and with it the objects it knows the object of knowledge in this mode at least is given as there with the same assurance that the thinker is given in the action of thought movements of thought in the nineteenth century  romanticism then as mead presents it is not an extreme subjectivism the romantic attitude is rather the externalizing of the self one projects ones self into the world sees the world through the guise the veil of ones own emotions that is the essential feature of the romantic attitude movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the world exists in relation to the self but the world is objectively there as a necessary structure of human experience self and notself subject and object are not contradictories but dialectical polarities another aspect of romantic selfconsciousness is the view that the self is a dynamic process the polarity of self and notself is not a static structure but an ongoing relationship something that is going on movements of thought in the nineteenth century the very existence of the self mead writes implies a notself it implies a notself which can be identified with the self you have seen that the term self is a reflexive affair it involves an attitude of separation of the self from itself both subject and object are involved in the self in order that it may exist the self must be identified in some sense with the notself it must be able to come back at itself from the outside the process then as involved in the self is the subjectobject process a process within which both of these phases of experience lie a process in which these different phases can be identified with each other — not necessarily as the same phase but at least as expressions of the same process movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the upshot of this point of view according to mead is an activist or pragmatic conception of mind and knowledge knowing is a process involving the interaction of self and notself knowledge is a result of a process in which the self takes action with reference to the notself in which the notself is appropriated by the self in this analysis of the romantic epistemology the germ of meads own philosophy of the act is apparent the interaction of self and notself is the foundation not only of our knowledge of the world but also of our knowledge of the self selfconsciousness requires the objectification of the self the romantic elucidation of the polarity of self and notself makes selfobjectification and therefore self consciousness theoretically comprehensible in action toward the notself selfdiscovery becomes possible the world according to mead is organized only in so far as one acts in it its meaning lies in the conduct of the individual and when one has built up his world as such a field of action then he realizes himself as the individual who carried out that action that is the only way in which he can achieve a self one does not get at himself simply by turning upon himself the eye of introspection one realizes himself in what he does in the ends which he sets up and in the means he takes to accomplish those ends movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the world is a field of action in this field there are tasks to be accomplished and it is through the accomplishing of tasks through the appropriation of the notself by the self that the self is enlarged and actualized thus in meads analysis philosophical romanticism provides a theoretical description of the conditions under which selfconsciousness is possible the fundamental condition of selfconsciousness as we have seen is self objectification however for mead the basic process of selfobjectification takes place in interpersonal experience we have to realize ourselves by taking the role of another playing the part of another taking the attitude of the community toward ourselves continually seeing ourselves as others see us regarding ourselves from the standpoint of those about us this is not the self consciousness that goes with awkwardness and uneasiness it is the assured recognition of ones own position ones social relations that comes from being able to take the attitude of others toward ourselves movements of thought in the nineteenth century  this interpretation of self consciousness which is the essence of meads theory of the self has its roots in the romantic analysis of the relation between self and notself history and romantic selfconsciousness there is a close connection between historical consciousness and self consciousness in romantic thought the romantic movement arose out of the failure of the bourgeois revolution the hopes of the age of reason had not been realized and the european was faced with a crisis in his sense of historical identity romantic consciousness mead argues was a discouraged consciousness in reaction to a disappointing present the romantics looked back to the middle ages for a model of life that carried with it a certain security but the bourgeois revolution for all its failures had created a new concept of the individual post revolutionary man looked at himself as having his own rights regarded himself as having his own feet to stand on in the romantic period european man experienced himself as an individual this gave him a certain independence which he did not have before it gave him a certain self consciousness that he never had before movements of thought in the nineteenth century  thus europe discovered the medieval period in the romantic period     but it also discovered itself in fact it discovered itself first furthermore it discovered the apparatus by means of which this selfdiscovery was possible the self belongs to the reflexive mode one senses the self only in so far as the self assumes the role of another so that it becomes both subject and object in the same experience this is the thing of great importance in this whole historical movement movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the romantic view of the middle ages then arose with reference to a problematic present and constituted an attempt on the part of european man to reconstruct the continuity of his experience this reconstruction of historical time — which is as suggested above a collective time — resulted in the creation of a new sense of collective identity the romantic conception of the medieval past developed as an effort to redefine the self european man had in a sense lost his self and he turned to history in an attempt to recapture his sense of continuity what the romantic period revealed then was not simply a past but a past as the point of view from which to come back upon the self one has to grow into the attitude of the other come back to the self to realize the self      movements of thought in the nineteenth century  romanticism in meads view is a reconstruction of the self through the selfs assuming the roles of the great figures of the past movements of thought in the nineteenth century  in placing oneself at the standpoint of others in the past one can view oneself in a new light here mead reveals still another form of experience — historical experience — in which the self might be objectified that is the self looked back at is own past as it found it in history it looked back at it and gave the past a new form as that out of which it had sprung it put itself back into the past it lived over again the adventures and achievements of those old heroes with an interest which children have for the lives of their parents — taking their roles and realizing not only the past but the present itself in that process movements of thought in the nineteenth century  in the romantic search for the historical connections between past and present a new past was created and with it a new sense of how the present had grown out of the past emerged history viewed from the standpoint of romantic selfconsciousness became the description of an organized past which rendered the problematic present of the romantic period intelligible romantic self consciousness turned to the past reconstructed the past and made the past one of the main foundations of the self romantic selfconsciousness was thereby expanded and deepened through historical consciousness we might say that the romantic movement reconstructed western selfconsciousness through a reconstruction of western historical consciousness the bourgeois revolution had sundered the connection between the past and present of early th century europe and had left the future in question it was the task of the romantic movement to redefine european self consciousness by way of a reconstruction of the continuity of historical time in so doing the romantic movement revealed the presentdirectedness and future directedness of historical consciousness and developed by the way an historically significant conception of the self as rooted in the experience of time c history and the idea of the future the idea of evolution is central in meads philosophy for mead experience is fundamentally processual and temporal experience is the undergoing of change meads entire ontology is an expression of evolutionary thinking his concept of realityas process is ecological in structure and dynamic in content nature is a system of systems a multiplicity of transacting fields and centers of activity the relation between organism and environment percipient event and consentient set is mutual and dynamic both organism and environment are active the activity of the organism alters the environment and the activity of the environment alters the organism there is no way of separating the two in reality no way of telling which is primary and which secondary thus meads employment of the concept of evolution is an aspect of his attempt to avoid the behavioristic and environmentalist determinism that would regard the organism as passive and as subject to the caprices of nature history as evolution meads concept of evolution is stated in social terms in meads ontology the entire realm of nature is described as social the ontological principle of sociality is a fundamentally evolutionary concept that describes reality as a process in which percipient events adjust to new situations and adapt themselves to a variety of consentient sets mind as an emergent in the social act of communication lies inside of a process of conduct movements of thought in the nineteenth century  and is temporally structured reflective intelligence is the peculiarly human way of overcoming the conflicts in experience it is called into play when action is inhibited and it has reference to a future situation in which the inhibition is overcome mind self and society  and since as we have seen the reconstruction of the past is an important element in the temporal organization of human action historical consciousness becomes a significant instrument in the human evolutionary process historical thought redefines the present in terms of a reinterpreted and reconstructed past and thereby facilitates passage into the future human existence then is described by mead in terms of evolution temporality and historicity human life involves a constant reconstruction of reality with reference to changing conditions and newly emergent situations this process of evolutionary reconstruction according to mead is evident in institutional change the historical consciousness fostered by the romantic movement has permitted us to view human institutions as structures which arose in a process and which simply expressed that process at a certain moment movements of thought in the nineteenth century  for mead the ideas of process and structure do not exclude each other but are related dialectically in actual historical developments historical thought then becomes one way of getting into the structure the movement the current of the process movements of thought in the nineteenth century  historical consciousness is a way of comprehending change but it is also a way of fostering change that is by comprehending the direction of historical change one can place oneself within a given current of change and pursue the historical success of that current in this way the historically minded individual or group can contribute to the development of new structures within the process of time this as mead points out is a way of carrying over revolution into evolution movements of thought in the nineteenth century  meads conception of historical consciousness is rooted in his view of intelligence as the reconstruction of human experience in response to new situations as has been shown earlier mead views the novel event as the basis of intelligent conduct if there were no new situations our conduct would be entirely habitual     conscious beings are those that are continually adjusting themselves using their past experience reconstructing their methods of conduct     that is what intelligence consists in not in finding out once and for all what the order of nature is and then acting in certain prescribed forms but rather in continual readjustment movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the historical resort to the past has reference to new situations that emerge in a present and that suggest a future human thought including historical consciousness is a confrontation with novelty and is aimed at passing from a problematic present to a nonproblematic future and the past is called in and reconstructed in relation to this project of coming to grips with the novelty of experience when what emerges is novel the explanation of this novelty is sought in an order of events in the past which was not previously recognized mead relative spacetime and simultaneity  historical consciousness as we have seen in the case of the romantic movement is instrumental in redefining and maintaining the temporal continuity of human experience novelty for mead is the foundation of consciousness intelligence and the freedom of conduct it is the ground of human experience as far as experience is concerned if everything novel were abandoned experience itself would cease movements of thought in the nineteenth century  human experience is temporal and as such it involves the continual appearance of that which is new thus we are always advancing into a future which is different from the past movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the future is open and in acting toward the future man becomes an active agent in the formulation of his own existence although reality always exists in a present the telos of this reality is to be found in the future in meads view the future is a factor perhaps the main factor in directing our conduct it is the nature of intelligent conduct to be futuredirected we are moving on in the very nature of the case in a process in which the past is moving into the present and into the future movements of thought in the nineteenth century  humandirectednesstowardthefuture is the foundation of freedom the mechanistic view of the world is inadequate as an account of freedom in fact mechanism since it denies the possibility of final causes and attempts to explain everything in terms of efficient causes must deny the possibility of freedom and yet the essence of conduct is that it is directed toward goals ends which while not yet actual are operative in the determination of the directions which conduct shall take movements of thought in the nineteenth century  goals unlike efficient causes are selected by the organism and our selection of goals is not explicable or predictable on the basis of efficient causes thus the interpenetration of experience does go into the future the essence of reality involves the future as essential to itself     the coming of the future into our conduct is the very nature of our freedom movements of thought in the nineteenth century  human action is action toward the future the past does not determine although it does condition human conduct it is rather human conduct that determines the past human action takes place in a present that opens on the future and it is in terms of the emergent present and impending future that the content and meaning of the past are determined human acts are teleological rather than mechanical thus as strauss indicates meads evolutionism permits him to challenge mechanical conceptions of action and the world and to restate problems of autonomy freedom and innovation in evolutionary and social rather than mechanistic and individualistic terms xviii the ideal of history although mead describes human existence as evolving toward an open future that cannot be prefigured with any finality he does not ignore the fact that there are ideals that are operative in directing human action cognizant of social realities and wary of utopian panaceas writes reck resorting to the method of science in questions of morality rather than to authoritative religions or traditional customs aware that men consist of impulses and instincts as well as of intelligence mead nevertheless discerned that there are ideal ends that operate as standards and goals for human conduct introduction xl that many of the ideal ends humans have pursued have been naive that is at odds with the realities of social and political life is clear in meads criticism of the notions of liberty equality and fraternity attempts to convert such ideals into realities have often met with frustration in the ironies of history it is for this reason that mead argues that ideal ends in some sense must be grounded in historical reality otherwise they become either fanciful wishes or mere ideological and rhetorical pronouncements of the many ideals that have influenced human conduct mead selects one for special consideration the ideal of the universal community this ideal has appeared time and again in the history of human thought and is in meads view the ideal or ultimate goal of human social progress mind self and society  the ideal of the universal community is then the ideal of history according to this ideal the goal of history is the establishment of a society in which everyone is going to recognize the interests of everyone else a society in which the golden rule is to be the rule of conduct that is a society in which everyone is to make the interests of others his own interest movements of thought in the nineteenth century  the vision of the universal community is in fact the basis of the philosophy of history as a distinctive form of thought a philosophy of history arose as soon as men conceived that society was moving toward the realization of triumphant ends in some great faroff event it became necessary to relate present conduct and transient values to the ultimate values toward which creation moved the philosophy of the act  this is the eschatological vision that is at the root of the historical conceptions of st paul st augustine hegel marx herbert spencer and as we shall see of mead himself the ideal of the universal community is however an abstraction in as much as it is not actualized in the concrete world in the life of the realities of political and social conflict eg the conflict between private and public interests the ideal of the universal community stands outside of history and yet this ideal is in a sense an historical ideal that is the ideal of the universal community although not explicit in history is according to mead implicit in the historical process the ideal is on the one hand operative in the hopes of mankind and on the other hand it is potentially present in certain concrete historical forces among these historical forces mead finds three of particular importance  the universal religions  universal economic processes and  the process of communication both economic processes and universal religions tend toward a universal community religious and economic attitudes tend potentially toward a social organization which goes beyond the actual structure in which individuals find themselves involved mind self and society  commerce and love are both potentially universalizing ideas and both have been significant factors in the development of human societies the forces of exchange and love know no boundaries all men are included although abstractly in the community of exchange and love although the religious attitude is a more profound form of identifying with others the economic process precisely because of its relative superficiality can travel more rapidly and make possible easier communication it is important to recognize mead writes that these religious and economic developments toward a universal community are going on in history mind self and society  that is the movement toward a universal community is an immanent process and not merely an abstract idea human history seems to imply a universal community a third historical force that implies universality is the process of communication to which mead devotes so much of his attention in his various works language as we have seen is the matrix of social coordination a linguistic gesture is an action which implies a response from another and which is dependent for its meaning on that response the process of communication is a way of gesturing toward others a way of transcending oneself a way of taking the role of another the linguistic act both presupposes and implies a human community of unspecified and unlimited extension language according to mead provides a universal community which is something like the economic community mind self and society  it is through significant communication that the individual is able to generalize her experience to include the experiences of others the world of thought and reason that emerges out of the social act of communication is almost by definition transpersonal and therefore verges toward the universal social organization and social interaction require a commonality of meaning a universe of discourse within which individual acts can take on significance mind self and society  the process of significant communication is the source of this universe of discourse it is meads contention that the thought world created in significant communication constitutes the widest of human communities to date the group defined by the logical universe of discourse is that which is the most general of all human groups — the one that claims the largest number of individual members this group is based on the universal functioning of gestures as significant symbols in the general human social process of communication mind self and society  this universalizing tendency of language comes closer to the realization of the ideal community than do the religious and economic attitudes these latter moreover actually presuppose the communicational process religion and economics organize themselves as social acts on the basis of communication mead thus states the ideal of history in primarily communicational terms the human social ideal    is the attainment of a universal human society in which all human individuals would possess a perfected social intelligence such that all social meanings would each be similarly reflected in their respective individual consciousnesses — such that the meanings of any one individuals acts or gestures as realized by him and expressed in the structure of his self through his ability to take the social attitudes of other individuals toward himself and toward their common social ends or purposes would be the same for any other individual whatever who responded to themmind self and society  meads vision seems to imply a society of many personalities mind self and society  in perfect communication with one another every person would be capable of putting herself into the place of every other person such a system of perfect communication in which the meanings of all symbols are fully transparent would realize the ideal of a universal human community mead recognizes of course how far we are from realizing the universal community our religions our economic systems and our communicational processes are severely limited at present these historical forces separate us as much as they unite us all three for example are conditioned by another historical force which has a fragmenting rather than a universalizing effect on modern culture namely nationalism see mead selected writings   mead points out that the limitation of social organization is found in the inability of individuals to place themselves in the perspectives of others to take their points of view the philosophy of the present  this limitation is far from overcome in contemporary life and the ideal human society cannot exist as long as it is impossible for individuals to enter into the attitudes of those whom they are affecting in the performance of their particular functions mind self and society  contemporary culture is a world culture we all affect each other politically culturally economically nonetheless the actual society in which universality can get its expression has not risen mind self and society  but it is also true that the ideal of the universal community is present by implication in our religions in our economic systems and in our communicational acts the ideal is there as a directive in human history it implies an evolution toward an ideal goal and informs our conduct accordingly meads social idealism is not utopian but historical the ideal of history the ideal of the universal community is an ideal of method not of program it indicates direction not destination the philosophy of the act  and in so far as this ideal informs our actual conduct in the historical world it is a concrete rather than an abstract universal the philosophy of the act  the ideal of history is both transcendent and immanent it is rooted in the past and present but leads into the future which is always awaiting realization historical thought then for mead is instrumental in the evolution of human society it is through the constant reconstruction of experience that human intelligence and human society are expanded meads evolutionary conception of human history is clearly a progressive notion which he seeks to document throughout his writings there is implicit in human history a tendency toward a larger and larger sense of community the ultimate formulation of this historical tendency is found in the ideal of the universal community this ideal is not purely abstract that is extrahistorical but is rooted in actual historical forces such as the universal religions modern economic forces and the human communicational process according to mead it is this ideal of the universal community that informs the human evolutionary process and that indicates the implicit direction or teleology of history  references and further reading a primary sources books mind self and society ed cw morris university of chicago  movements of thought in the
