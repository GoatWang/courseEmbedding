open carry well certainly allow customers to do that based on what the local laws are we dont believe its up to us to legislate what the local gun control laws should be its up to the local legislators to decide to do that so we follow local laws we ask our customers to be respectful to the other people they are shopping with and we really havent had any issues inside of our stores as a

of kroger operations fact book careers values history of kroger in  barney kroger invested his life savings of  to open a grocery store at  pearl street in downtown cincinnati the son of a merchant he ran his business with a simple motto “be particular never sell anything you would not want yourself” it was a credo that would serve the kroger co well over the next  years as the supermarket business evolved into a variety of formats aimed at satisfying the everchanging needs of shoppers  with nearly  stores in  states under two dozen banners and annual sales of more than  billion kroger today ranks as one of the world’s largest retailers many aspects of the company’s business today trace their roots to mr kroger’s early efforts to serve his customers consider two specialty departments that today are regular fixtures in the company’s supermarkets – bakeries and meat and seafood shops in the early s most grocers bought their bread from independent bakeries but mr kroger always pursuing quality as the key ingredient for profit recognized that if he baked his own bread he could reduce the price for his customers and still make money so in  he became the first grocer in the country to establish his own bakeries he was also the first to sell meats and groceries under one roof mr kroger also spied the promise of increasing his income by manufacturing the products he sold it began in that first kroger store on pearl st when farmers came to town with their produce he bought far more cabbage than he could expect his customers to buy he took the cabbage home to his mother who following her favorite recipe turned it into tangy sauerkraut that proved hugely popular with his german customers the manufacturing effort born in that back room was the beginning of what is today one of the largest food manufacturing businesses in america kroger operates  food manufacturing facilities that make thousands of products ranging from bread cookies and milk to soda pop ice cream and peanut butter about  of privatelabel items found in the company’s stores today are made at one of kroger’s manufacturing plants these corporate brands today account for an impressive  of kroger’s total store dollar sales providing the company with a significant strategic advantage yet in many other respects mr kroger would hardly recognize the company today in response to customers who want the convenience of onestop shopping stores have grown much larger to accommodate more variety and more merchandise new combination stores kroger’s primary format today average  square feet the company’s marketplace stores which offer expanded general merchandise are between  and  square feet and multidepartment stores under the fred meyer banner truly tip the scales at over  square feet

more than  locations to appeal to customers who want to gas up their cars during their shopping trip  mergers have played a key role in kroger’s growth over the years in   years after the company’s founding kroger merged with dillon companies inc in kansas to become a coasttocoast operator of food drug and convenience stores the biggest merger in kroger’s history came in  when the company teamed up with fred meyer inc in a  billion deal that created a supermarket chain with the broadest geographic coverage and widest variety of formats in the food retailing industry the merger also enabled kroger to generate huge economies of scale in purchasing manufacturing information systems and logistics in an era when many larger mergers failed the success of the krogerfred meyer merger stands out in  kroger finalized its merger with harris teeter a regional chain of more than  stores  this merger brought to kroger an exceptional brand and complementary base of stores in highgrowth markets primarily in the midatlantic region and the district of columbia  later that year kroger merged with vitacostcom one of the largest pure ecommerce companies in the nutrition and healthy living market

open carry well certainly allow customers to do that based on what the local laws are we dont believe its up to us to legislate what the local gun control laws should be its up to the local legislators to decide to do that so we follow local laws we ask our customers to be respectful to the other people they are shopping with and we really havent had any issues inside of our stores as a

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
