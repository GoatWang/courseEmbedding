necessary to perform the duties of a trustee as to each independent trustee his status as not being an interested person as defined under the  act and as to mr leal his association with crm in addition mr klein and mr moore each served as a trustee of certain of the funds predecessor funds which were a series of a different mutual fund complex  the board believes that each trustees

board or any trustee as having any special expertise or experience and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the board by reason thereof board committees the board currently does not have a chairman or a lead independent trustee however the board of trustees has a standing trustees committee that takes a central role in governance and oversight of the funds including as to matters customarily covered by an audit committee and those presenting conflicts or potential conflicts of interest for management the trustees committee is comprised of all of the independent trustees the independent trustees regularly meet without the presence of management and are advised by independent legal counsel the responsibilities of the trustee committee are to   perform the specific tasks assigned to independent trustees pursuant to the  act including annual consideration of the investment management contracts and service plans with respect to the funds    nominate independent trustees of the funds   oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the funds and their internal controls over financial reporting and as the trustees committee deems appropriate inquire into the internal control over financial reporting of the service providers to the funds   oversee the quality and integrity of financial statements of the funds and the independent audit thereof   preapprove the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the funds and in connection therewith to review and evaluate the qualifications

adopted a written charter for the trustees committee which is available on the funds website wwwcrmfundscom in connection with these oversight responsibilities the trustees committee along with the board oversees risk management of the funds  investment management and business operations in addition the trustees committee works with fund management in setting the agendas for board and trustee committee meetings the board has determined that delegation to the trustees committee of the oversight responsibilities outlined above helps ensure that the funds have effective and independent governance and oversight the board further has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given crms role with respect to the funds investment and business operations the board also believes that its leadership structure serves to facilitate the orderly and efficient flow of information to the independent trustees from management and otherwise enhance the boards oversight role the trustees committee does not have a formal policy for considering nominees for the position of trustee recommended by the funds shareholders nonetheless the trustees committee may on an informal basis consider any investor recommendations of possible trustees that are received the trustees committee does not have specific minimum qualifications for nominees nor has it established specific qualities or skills that it regards as necessary for one or more of the independent trustees to possess other than qualities or skills that may be required by applicable law or regulation in identifying and evaluating potential independent trustee candidates the trustees will consider experience qualifications attributes and skills that the trustees committee believe based on the then current composition and skills of the independent trustees and experience or skills that may be appropriate in light of anticipated retirements changing business conditions and regulatory or other developments would maintain or enhance the effectiveness of the independent trustees oversight of the funds affairs the committee considers diversity in identifying candidates but has no formal policy the board will consider trustee candidates recommended by shareholders and submitted in accordance with applicable law and procedures as described in the section of this proxy statement entitled submission of shareholder proposals the trustees committee recommended each of the noninterested nominees to serve as an independent trustee the trustees committee followed its standard practices in identifying and recommending each nominee the trustees committee considered the experience and capabilities of the current board members as a group in order to identify a skill set and other characteristics that would be most complementary in a new board member  the trustees committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended june   the funds also have a standing valuation committee
