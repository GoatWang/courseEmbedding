stars category business  finances contact informationunited states first premier bank reviews january   terrible company i have been a customer with first premier bank for over three years i have  credit cards centennial and platinum issued by them during the years i have been a customer i have always stayed under my credit limit and paid my bills before the due date usually more than the minimum due all this time i never requested and was never offered a credit limit increase my current limits are  and  i have been repairing my damaged but not horrible credit over the last year or so and have  other credit cards rewards and aspire with  credit limits i also have an hsbc and total card with  limits but they are newer my issue is that i am planning to pay off and close my low limit accounts in hopes of further improving my credit since the first premier cards are relatively long standing good accounts i didnt want to close them i for the first time requested a credit limit increase and was denied they say because of my credit history but they also say that they dont access ones credit report for limit increase requests this does not ring logical with me considering the fact that all my other cards are under the limits and are always paid on time also during the next billing cycle first premier charged their excessive annual fees and that coupled with their other feesinterest put me a couple dollars over limit for the first time obviously they were quick to add the overlimit fees as well i didnt fight this because i take responsibility for my own balance and have since paid my accounts back under the limits i dont know if anybody is given increases from this predatory company but i believe that i was denied just so they could charge me the overlimit fees i plan to pay off these worthless cards and close the accounts please do not support this card issuer get an aspire or orchard card instead january   terrible experience i lost my job in  and tried to utilize this insurance with first premier bank i was denied several times so i tried to keep up with the payments but i fell behind and received several calls saying if i made payments by western union that i would receive extra credit for doing so everything that i was told was a lie when i tried to close the account they would not let me or even try to work with me to get it caught up this company wants your money and does not want to give you honest information september   owned money for a credit card i never owned first premier bank wwwfirstpremiercom i receive a letter telling me i owed a first premier bank some money for a credit card that i did not wont are even have this card where is this card why is this happening i do not wont this card july   someone else used my social security number i recently inquired about a letter i received from first premier bank i contacted the bank stating that i did not feel comfortable about mailing the info requested after giving my social security number i was informed that my information did not match the information you had in your system i was told that my issues would be addressed and i would be contacted this was about a week ago i am sending in a letter to make sure my complaint is noted august   stay way away from premier bank i have had a visa card with premier for over three years and they are a fraud i paid my balance off in full and they said it would be  to  days before they could post it to my account but then when i canceled my account with then they took the money out of my checking with in  minuets of cancellation amazing how they are in no rush till they loose your business stay way away from premier bank july   do not deal with them at all hello my complaint is against first premier bank i am

reviews  out of  stars  reviews from account holders in the last year           add review additional ratings you might find helpful application process  out of  stars customer service  out of  stars   most helpful positive review jan   do what i didand rebuild your credit anonymous account holder i am writing this review to let everyone know its ok it really is i got this card back in may  and cancelled it january   i kept this card approximately   years when i first applied for this card my credit was terrible but they approved me for a  limit and at the time of approval i was very grateful the first thing i did was set up an online account for the purpose of making payments most importantly i made all payments on time making sure to pay a few days before the due date and paying in full when i could never any issues with customer service or payment receipts they really do help to rebuild you credit because payments are reported to the  major credit bureaus every month i cancelled the card because i now qualify for high limit no interest credit cards without annual fees and first premier does not provide credit line increases with out a charge so do what i diduse the first primier credit card as a tool to reestablish your credit and everything else will fall into place keep in mind this is not the card for people with excellent credit so use it wisely and responsibly more  most helpful negative review nov   good for rebuilding credit dotiso account holder this card is meant to be used to pay in full on time everytime they penalize you for being a minute late and for those like me that ended up rebuilding credit this card is god send all other companies denied me except this one after the first year they start charging a monthly  servicing fee which adds onto your existing interest so beware you will not pay off this card off in minimum payments its a death trap for those that dont know how to manage their finances but what this card did do for me is rebuild my credit which is what it is intended to do they report to all three credit bureaus every month my score started off at  after i lost my job and started racking debt i ended up paying off all of my existing debt as well as making small purchases like gas and electric bill on this card every month paid in full every month seven months later i get approved for a loan to purchase a new car at  four months later i purchase another used car for  the bank that is providing me the loan for my used car is capital one so i quickly apply for their quicksilver one credit card and and get approved for a  limit a year later im bumped up to a  limit two years an amazon credit card and now after three years i just qualified for an amex everyday card none of this would have happened if it wasnt for the first premier credit card but now its finally time to cancel because paying this monthly fee of  is getting ridiculous as well as an annual fee but i can safely say i can cancel after two car loans renting an apartment with three major good credit cards i was given a second chance i took it and i didnt mess up this time i plan to keep it that way for those that are interested i went from  to  in one year rebuilding process is quick but once youre past  it slows down be patient and dont apply for any other major credit cards until after a year later the more you apply and get denied the more hard inquiries hit your credit report which will delay the process of getting a better card even with a decent credit score  more  showing suggested reviews all reviews sort by most helpful newest oldest highest rated these reviews were written by current and former account holders in the last year jul   good for beginners bad credit corp account holder use this card for  year pay off in full dump it after  years use second years fees too expensive i qualified for better cards only after  full years use this card serves its purpose more  enter your reply cancel submit jun   scamstay away at all costs deuce account holder this bank will give you the card then utilize every excuse to penalize you in any way possible i made above minimum payments mothly earlyand they would still send reminders to my email reminding me of my monthly payment due i called several times customer service only to be told the reminders are automatic despite the fact i was able to verify with confirmation number my above minimum payment was already processed early for the said month equally they were always tacking on various processing fees which when i called customer

account holder after months of on time payments and using this card monthly about  and would pay off in full within two weeks of my automatic payment not going through they closed my account and i only found this out when i went to make a  payment via the phone they told me if it happens twice they automatically close your account the automatic payment attempts were two days apart i cannot believe i did not receive a letter or a voicemail stating what happened and that they were going to close my account would never recommend this bank to anyone will continue to use my business elsewhere  more  enter your reply cancel submit jun   ridiculous and excessive fees kjt account holder i applied for this joke of a card simply to have something set aside for emergencies my credit is not fantastic but frankly not that bad either ive got other cards and a car loan and none of them are this utterly ridiculous i was expected to pay a  program fee and an annual fee and a monthly fee all for a lousy  credit limit when i called them and told tht that was obscene and said cancel it i still got daily phone calls to remond me to pay thiere program fee before i could use the card insert your choice of expletive here no stay far far away from this cardtry for capital one they will give most anyone a chance to prove yourself and they wont rip you off with absurd fees more  enter your reply cancel submit may   great anonymous account holder its a great card to start out building up your credit if you dont know how credit cards work get more information before getting one seriously its pretty cool more  enter your reply cancel submit may   this card will do anonymous account holder the only issue i have with this card is if one card is over do they lock all your

payments so i cancelled my cards but thank premiere for the help and support i needed it more  enter your reply cancel submit may   work with you to a point anonymous account holder when payment is due you better make it more  enter your reply cancel submit may   awful cubbee account holder this is the worst card ever they charge you a percent of charges that you dont  even make becasue byt the
