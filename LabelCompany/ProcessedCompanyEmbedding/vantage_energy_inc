explore for and produce natural gas but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional national or worldwide basis these companies may be able to pay more for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater resources to attract and maintain industry personnel in addition these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low natural gas market prices our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can which would adversely affect our competitive position our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment in addition because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing natural gas properties company description we are a growthoriented independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition development exploitation
