a detailed freewheeling interview with adexchanger in which he described seven priorities for the advertising side of facebooks business which is to say virtually all of its  billionper quarter business in doing so however he also hinted at facebooks seven biggest problems here are rajarams priorities and the problems that come with them  data facebook has one of the biggest hoards of marketing data on the planet and its members are targetable based on their demographics and interests its a potential marketing goldmine problem facebook isnt doing anything with it when asked if facebook ever planned to switch on its data for ad targeting rajaram said only not at this time  facebook pages  facebook pages work really well to reach people at all parts of the funnel the page should be the hub of all your marketing we believe because pages allow you to reach people in the news feed pages allow you to publish content that initially starts out as organic content and then you can sponsor or boost the content problem pages are free but facebook needs to see sales dollars growth but theres no such thing as a free page at facebook as rajaram admits most posts made by marketers are only seen by a small proportion of followers because users news feeds are so crowded so marketers are forced to pay to get the reach they need organically you get anywhere from  percent to  percent of your fans that you reach organically in order to reach the remaining  to  percent sponsoring posts is important  mobile our advertising strategy on mobile is all about making sure we are part of the organic content that people consume it’s primarily news feed on mobile it’s actually fairly easy for us problem everyone knows facebooks mobile app leaves a lot to be desired also rajaram says facebook will not introduce banner ads leaving it dependent on sponsored stories—which arent as obvious or intrusive as display advertising he says we don’t introduce content which would not be there otherwise—like a banner ad or something like that—in mobile it’s a much easier transition for us from a pure product development point of view thats fine  except that advertisers like obvious and intrusive media the mobile screen is comparatively tiny and facebook has turned its back on a major part of the real estate it offers  offers we intrinsically believe that advertising and marketing should enhance native‑user behaviors things like offers originated from this belief when we survey users asking what are the reasons you like a page on facebook one of the primary reasons was people want discounts coupons and deals to build a compelling product it takes a coupon which is an ageold thing problem when was the last time you redeemed a facebook offer  speed our focus is to move fast — have all teams that work together not encumbered by any constraints they execute and launch something fast and learn something and move on problem facebook is rolling out new products so fast its confusing for clients heres  how rajaram says facebook communicates with its main ad partners the socalled preferred marketing developers pmd we have a number of communication channels with pmds all pmds have access to a pmdonly community forum we have several forums groups on facebook that they have access to then we have product and program update forums then we have pmd email support we also have regular newsletters that we send out and we have limited opportunities for select pmds to test products in pre‑launch status so they can test it and give us feedback phew  facebook exchange there are obviously some differences in facebook creative being different from standardized display and so on we want to make sure the partners understand that just because they are integrated it doesn’t mean the responsibility ends there their responsibility is to work with us to make sure the advertisers who are our common client have a great experience on facebook exchange problem rajaram seems to be implying that facebooks ad formats are a creative hurdle for some buyers facebooks ads come in different shapes and sizes than standard web format banner ads—which means that clients have to create separate campaigns just for facebook before they buy on facebook  video facebook is one of the largest servers of video in the world and video advertising is a lot more lucrative than display advertising so its a huge opportunity for video ads problem facebook isnt doing anything about it unlike everybody else it’s something we haven’t talked too much about we probably need to focus and build a lot of stuff on the consumer side if we want to do something i think so far we haven’t talked much about the advertising side of video at this point related

this video in our first episode of confessions of a product manager we interview gokul rajaram of square dont know who gokul is let me google that for you the man is sometimes referred to as the godfather of adsense due to his key role in the early success of one of googles most profitable products since leaving google in  rajaram has founded and sold his own startup chai labs led adproduct strategy at facebook and most recently joined square to help the san franciscobased company revolutionize the world of commerce as if that werent enough gokul is also one of the friendliest most humble and downtoearth guys we know in this interview gokul and our director of product matt pasienski cover a lot of territory including how to effectively staff up a successful product development team which original star wars character best reflects gokuls approach to product management hint its not darth vader personal tips and tricks for managing the daily grind of product management spoiler alert stickies arent a tactic theyre a way of life big thanks to our friends over at square for hosting us and to gokul for making the time to chat with us enjoy and stay tuned for future installments of pm confessions create your free wizeline account full transcript matt pasienski its gokul gokul rajaram gokul yeah matt pasienski is that good gokul rajaram yeah perfect matt pasienski because my last names pasienski and no one everand then rajaram gokul rajaram yep matt pasienski okay just wanted to get thatim sensitive so im here with gokul rajaram who is a product managing genius he was at google and has been called the godfather of adsense then started his own company called chai technologies which was acquired by facebook where you then ran product management for ads gokul rajaram yep matt pasienski and now youre here at square so obviously a whole range of different types of companies and products and experience so we just want to pick your brain about whats the best way to manage product whats the best way to run your teams and whats the best way to make decisions gokul rajaram awesome excited to be here thank you very much thank you for having me matt pasienski first question when you were at google its  very big time especially for ads they do things differently there what were some of the innovative things that they did around product management that were different or innovative gokul rajaram so one of the things that i loved about google and weve tried to have it here at square also is that success begets success what that means is you dont staff up a team up front without understanding what that team can accomplish so you first start really small for any product  however big the vision is you start with a very small team you start with a team of  or  engineers a product manager a designer and you see what they can do you give them some milestones you let them set their milestones you give them some metrics if they hit their metrics you give them more people when i started out on adsense we were literally  people and we launched a product with  or  people and then it grew from there and then by  months from then we were  people so you hit your metrics and you get more people and that should be how a team should operate you should never forward staff a project you should always staff with small teams and small teams are actually more efficient process matt pasienski its like how do you think about the separation of the team and the product and your consumer base or do all of those things have to grow in unison gokul rajaram all of them grow in unison they all have to be really inaudible  tight and ultimately of course the product needs to be consistent with the company strategy so first of all the reason for existence for the product comes down from the company strategy and then after that the metrics of the product need to be consistent with how it feeds back into the company strategy so ultimately we have a saying here that launch is not success its not just about launching a product its about growing the product making it successful based on any metric that the product has matt pasienski excellent what percentage of those initial small seeds of products were actually successful and how well do you think that approach of just putting out all these little projects succeeded and what could have been improved or what ended up getting improved gokul rajaram i would say about  of googles initiatives were a success but more than the  the philosophy of the fact that you are empowered to take an idea and run with it create a small team go and influence people and build something has really savored the company and i think very few companies could have done things like self driving cars and google fiber and all of these things that google is doing without having that mindset in the people matt pasienski what do you think is the best want to manage that bottomup process where people are trying things youre measuring them youre seeing whats successful and then growing those projects what do you think is the right type of mentality as a manager and in specific which stars wars character best represents it you have darth vader maybe on one hand and i dont know maybe luke skywalker on the other hand gokul rajaram laughs matt pasienski you just pick one our of that spectrum  gokul rajaram so i think its as a manager or as someone who sets frameworks the most important thing you need to do is have guardrails what you need to tell the team is here is the set of things here is the surface area of all the things we will consider or work on for example at square it might be focusing around commerce but even commerce is too broad so we try to say what are the things that are more specific than commerce that we want to do and then within those you then have a process for people to bring ideas and then have very clear ways that you say that an idea gets converted into a team based on this criteria or this metric but then after that you really need to let them run i cant really constrain them too much because small teams will feel very clear ownership versus being topdown managed are the ones that are more successful    matt pasienski so i think you are saying obiwan gokul rajaram obiwan is perfect i was going to say commissioner hans solo and darth vader but obiwan is better matt pasienski excellent im more of a lando i just want to act smooth gokul rajaram there you go lando is good but obiwan for this one matt pasienski obiwan is the best gokul rajaram obiwan is awesome matt pasienski you have a notebook in your pocket it looks like its on you all the time talk about how you use that gokul rajaram yeah so im in meetings all the time and i need to take my thoughts down in a way that i can remember it and transcribe it and then take actions on it so the notebook is essentially both a todo list so i maintain my todo list on paper form as well as a meetings notes list its very hard to take notes on a phone because the person you are meeting with feels that you are checking your email and its also hard to cart around a laptop all the time and open it again the whole perception of doing email so i use a notebook its served me well for the last  years and i hope it will for the next  matt pasienski thats interesting okay so you  gokul rajaram how do you do notes im curious matt pasienski we actually have notepads in every office and im a big sticky fan i have stickies everywhere and the thing i like about those is that they go up and then i integrate all of my notes into documents that i share with my team so it this intermediate format but then my biggest thrill during the day is taking down a bunch of stickies as i finish tasks gokul rajaram thats exactlyfor me its crossing out a todo it gives you such power when you cross something out matt pasienski yeah and if youre lost you just look up and youre like sticky and you just take it off and you start working kind of like an engineer with a backlog just building backlogs all day what would you say are youre biggest top  top  tips for project managers that are looking to improve their team improve their process or just looking to improve their own personal performance gokul rajaram yeah think like a ceo remember that your job is not just to be responsible for the technical aspects of the product it is for the holistic product this means go to market pricing is a feature so pricing customers everything you need to be the person who is ultimately responsible for the product you are the guardian of the product so that mindset is really hard to get because a lot of product managers come from different backgrounds some come from engineering some come from marketing so ive seen that this in their background they tend to gravitate towards that aspect of the product its really hard to find product managers who really think of themselves as gms and are literally responsible for the product even though they dont have people who report to them working on the product they really need to think of themselves as a ceo thats the biggestthats the number  tip all successful pms ive seen have gm or ceo mentality matt pasienski okay there we go you heard it from the godfather laughter thank you very much gokul rajaram thank you matt pasienski that was amazing i appreciate it all right gokul rajaram awesome   posted by adam sewall on tuesday september   recommended for you keval desai on what makes optimizely great pm
