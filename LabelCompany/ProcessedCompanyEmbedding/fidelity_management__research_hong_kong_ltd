guarantee against loss keep in mind that investing involves risk the value of your investment will fluctuate over time and you may gain or lose money stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer political regulatory market or economic developments in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk liquidity risk call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible etfs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments etfs are subject to management fees and other expenses unlike mutual funds etf shares are bought and sold at market price which may be higher or lower than their nav and are not individually redeemed from the fund because of their narrow focus sector funds tend to be more volatile than funds that diversify across many sectors and companies  copyright  fmr llc all rights reserved terms of use privacy security site map accessibility this is for persons in the us only assets management
