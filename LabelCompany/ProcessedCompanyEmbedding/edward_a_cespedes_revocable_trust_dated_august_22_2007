lifetime by a trust instrument a trust may be revocable or irrevocable in the united states a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable except in california oklahoma and texas in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable an irrevocable trust can be broken revoked only by a judicial proceeding trusts and similar relationships have existed since roman times the trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who isare the equitable owners of the trust property trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners they must provide a regular accounting of trust

settlor who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries the trust is governed by the terms under which it was created in most jurisdictions this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed it is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties and for multiple individuals to share a single rolecitation needed for example in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiariescitation needed trusts have existed since roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states so statements in this article are generalizations understanding the jurisdictionspecific case law involved is tricky some us states are adapting the uniform trust code to codify and harmonize their trust laws but statespecific variations still remain an owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee separating the propertys legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits this may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent incapacitated or deceased testamentary trusts may be created in wills defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries while the trustee is given legal title to the trust property in accepting the property title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries the primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty the duty of prudence the duty of impartiality a trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior to ensure beneficiaries receive their due trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties including a duties of openness and transparency duties of recordkeeping accounting and disclosure in addition a trustee has a duty to know understand and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties there are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests courts can reverse a trustees actions order profits returned and impose other sanctions if it finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures it is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement history english common lawedit main article history of trusts roman law had a welldeveloped concept of the trust fideicommissum in terms of testamentary trusts created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos living trusts which apply while the creator lives this was created by later common law jurisdictions personal trust law developed in england at the time of the crusades during the th and th centuries in medieval english trust law the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use or cestui que trust at the time land ownership in england was based on the feudal system when a landowner left england to fight in the crusades he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return however crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return unfortunately for the crusader english common law did not recognize his claim as far as the kings courts were concerned the land belonged to the trustee who was under no obligation to return it the crusader had no legal claim the disgruntled crusader would then petition the king who would refer the matter to his lord chancellor the lord chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience at this time the principle of equity was born the lord chancellor would consider it unconscionable that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the crusader the true owner therefore he would find in favor of the returning crusader over time it became known that the lord chancellors court the court of chancery would continually recognize the claim of a returning crusader the legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested the crusader was the beneficiary and the acquaintance the trustee the term use of land was coined and in time developed into what we now know as a trust significanceedit the trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the english legal systemverification needed today trusts play a significant role in most common law systems and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes in curaçao for example the trust was enacted into law on  january 0 however the curaçao civil code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument france has recently added a similar romanlawbased device to its own law with the fiducie amended in 00 the fiducie unlike a trust is a contractual relationship trusts are widely used internationally especially in countries within the english law sphere of influence and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems they do recognise the concept under the hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition partly only the extent that they are parties thereto the hague convention also regulates conflict of trusts although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers they have become very important in american capital markets particularly through pension funds in certain countries essentially always trusts and mutual funds often trusts basic principlesedit property of any sort may be held in a trust the uses of trusts are many and varied for both personal and commercial reasons and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning asset protection and taxes living trusts may be created during a persons life through the drafting of a trust instrument or after death in a will in a relevant sense a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors investors are also the beneficiaries this is particularly evident in the delaware business trust which could theoretically with the language in the governing instrument be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation– although traditionally the massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the us one of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee multiple beneficiaries and their respective creditors particularly the trustees creditors making it bankruptcy remote and leading to its use in pensions mutual funds and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust terminologyedit chart of a trust appointer this is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one this person is usually mentioned in the trust deed appointment in trust law appointment often has its everyday meaning it is common to talk of the appointment of a trustee for example however appointment also has a technical trust law meaning either the act of appointing ie giving an asset from the trust to a beneficiary usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust or the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment the trustees right to do this where it exists is called a power of appointment sometimes a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee such as the settlor the protector or a beneficiary as trustee for atf this is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee beneficiary a beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns in its own capacity iioc this term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf protector a protector may be appointed in an express inter vivos trust as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another the legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate noone doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities if a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees however a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one also protectors are comparatively new while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years it is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties and by others that they do not the case law has not yet established this point settlors this is the person or persons who creates the trust grantors is a common synonym terms of the trust means the settlors wishes expressed in the trust instrument trust deed a trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee beneficiaries settlor and appointer and the terms and conditions of the agreement trust distributions a trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust trustee a person either an individual a corporation or more than one of either who administers a trust a trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trusts beneficiaries creationedit trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor express trusts0 or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts an implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties implied trusts are divided into two categories resulting and constructive a resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent a constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties regardless of their intentions typically a trust can be created in the following ways a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees often referred to as an inter vivos or living trust an oral declaration the will of a decedent usually called a testamentary trust or a court order for example in family proceedings in some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document formalitiesedit generally a trust requires three certainties as determined in knight v knight intention there must be a clear intention to create a trustre adams and the kensington vestry subject matter the property subject to the trust must be clearly identified palmer v simmonds one may not for example state settle the majority of my estate as the precise extent cannot be ascertained trust property may be any form of specific property be it real or personal tangible or intangible it is often for example real estate shares or cash objects the beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified or at least be ascertainable re hains settlement in the case of discretionary trusts where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries mcphail v doulton beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust for example my future grandchildren alternatively the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries trusteesedit a trust may have multiple trustees and these trustees are the legal owners of the trusts property but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties such as a duty of care and a duty to inform if trustees do not adhere to these duties they may be removed through a legal action the trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees a trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument if a trust lacks a trustee a court may appoint a trustee the trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust the trusts affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries filing required tax returns and other duties in some cases dependent upon the trust instrument the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit a trustee may be held personally liable for problems although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased for example a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested in addition a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given however in the united states similar to directors and officers an exculpatory clause may minimize liability although this was previously held to be against public policy this position has changed in the united states the uniform trust code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts although trustees may be unpaid commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about  of assets under management0 beneficiariesedit the beneficiaries are beneficial or equitable owners of the trust property either immediately or eventually the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property or they will receive the property itself the extent of a beneficiarys interest depends on the wording of the trust document one beneficiary may be entitled to income for example interest from a bank account whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twentyfive years the settlor has much discretion when creating the trust subject to some limitations imposed by law the beneficiaries are jocosely known as trust fund babies or trustafarians purposesedit common purposes for trusts include privacy trusts may be created purely for privacy the terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions while the terms of a trust are not spendthrift clauses trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries for example ones children against their own inability to handle money these are especially attractive for spendthrifts courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors but not against creditors of a settlorcitation needed wills and estate planning trusts frequently appear in wills indeed technically the administration of every deceaseds estate is a form of trust conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceaseds spouse if any and then to the children equally if the children are under  or under some other age mentioned in the will  and  are common a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached the executor of the will is usually the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries the trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority charities in some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts in others corporations may be charities also in most jurisdictions charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit in england for example by the charity commission unit trusts the trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle the unit trust pension plans pension plans are typically set up as a trust with the employer as settlor and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries remuneration trusts trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents this form of trust was developed by paul baxendalewalker and has since gained widespread use corporate structures complex business arrangements most often in the finance and insurance sectors sometimes use trusts among various other entities eg corporations in their structure asset protection trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote for example a discretionary trust of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary in such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them and therefore in theory protected from creditors in addition the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name eg the teddy bear trust these strategies are ethically and legally controversial tax planning the tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route if indeed it would be possible to do so in many cases the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance for an example see the nilband discretionary trust explained at inheritance tax united kingdom coownership ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust in particular ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee construction law in canada and minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust in the event of contractor insolvency this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed legal retainer lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolventcitation needed however strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts typesedit alphabetic list of trust typesedit trusts go by many different names depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes a single trust might accurately be described in several ways for example a living trust is often an express trust which is also a revocable trust and might include an incentive trust and so forth community land trust a community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing community gardens civic buildings commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community “clts” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability economic diversity and local access to essential services constructive trust unlike an express trust a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee a constructive trust is imposed by the law as an equitable remedy this generally occurs due to some wrongdoing where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it a constructive trust is essentially a legal fiction for example a court of equity recognizing a plaintiffs request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them the constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization the distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust the latter is an equitable remedy imposed by law being truly remedial the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property discretionary trust in a discretionary trust certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary ie whether there is a class of beneficiaries which a person can be said to belong to in that way persons who satisfy that criterion who are members of that class can enforce the trust re baden’s deed trusts mcphail v doulton directed trust in these types a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trusts execution these participants may include a distribution committee trust protector or investment advisor the directed trustees role is administrative which involves following investment instructions holding legal title to the trust assets providing fiduciary and tax accounting coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants dynasty trust also known as a generationskipping trust a type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantors grandchildren not the grantors children the children of the grantor never take title to the assets this allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first generationskipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantors children however because any income generated by the trusts assets can be made accessible to the grantors children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren express trust an express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust over their assets either now or upon his or her later death in these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument which will either be a will or a trust deed almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type they contrast with resulting and constructive trusts the intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct for an express trust to exist there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property in the usa statute of frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value or is real estate fixed trust in a fixed trust the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor the trustee has little or no discretion common examples are a trust for a minor to x if she attains  a life interest to pay the income to x for her lifetime and a remainder to pay the capital to y after the death of x grantor retained annuity trust grat grat is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers assets as a gift into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument at the end of the term the financial property is transferred taxfree to the named beneficiaries this trust is commonly used in the us to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax hybrid trust a hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts in a hybrid trust the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor but the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property once these fixed amounts have been paid out is to be paid to the beneficiaries implied trust an implied trust as distinct from an express trust is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist a resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for in such a case the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor the creator of the trust in other words the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document improvement trust improvement trusts can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area the trust is often run by a committee and can act similarly to a development agency depending on the provisions of its charter incentive trust a trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary the term incentive trust is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee inter vivos trust or living trust a settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust irrevocable trust in contrast to a revocable trust an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed although in rare cases a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust land trust a private nonprofit organization that as all or part of its mission actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition or by its stewardship of such land or easements or an agreement whereby one party the trustee agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party the beneficiary offshore trust strictly speaking an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident however the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or colloquially as tax havens offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions by extension onshore trust has come to mean any trust resident in a hightax jurisdiction personal injury trust a personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury private and public trusts a private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary by contrast a public trust also called a charitable trust has some charitable end as its beneficiary in order to qualify as a charitable trust the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty providing education carrying out some religious purpose etc the permissible objects are generally set out in legislation but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust by analogy charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation protective trust here the terminology is different between the uk and the usa in the uk a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest they have become comparatively rare in the usa a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning in another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust often a person a wishes to leave property to another person b a however fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before a dies and that therefore b would receive none of it a could establish a trust with b as the beneficiary but then a would not be entitled to use of the property before they died protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation a would establish a trust with both a and b as beneficiaries with the trustee instructed to allow a use of the property until they died and thereafter to allow its use to b the property is then safe from being claimed by as creditors at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment this use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders and is frequently used as an alternative to them purpose trust or more accurately noncharitable purpose trust all charitable trusts are purpose trusts generally the law does not permit noncharitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law and arguable quistclose trusts certain jurisdictions principally offshore jurisdictions have enacted legislation validating noncharitable purpose trusts generally qtip trust short for qualified terminal interest property a trust recognized under the tax laws of the united states which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax resulting trust a resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where  a trust fails wholly or in part as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets or  a voluntary payment is made by a to b in circumstances which do not suggest gifting b becomes the resulting trustee of as payment revocable trust a trust of this kind may be amended altered or revoked by its settlor at any time provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the us as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a persons final affairs after death secret trust a post mortem trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one or more legatees of a will semisecret trust a trust in which a will demonstrates the intention to create a trust names a trustee but does not identify the intended beneficiary simple trust in the us jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings in a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust this is also called a bare trust all other trusts are special trusts where the trustee has active duties beyond this a simple trust in federal income tax law is one in which under the terms of the trust document all net income must be distributed on an annual basis in the uk a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is  in england and wales or  in scotland special trust in the us a special trust also called complex trust contrasts with a simple trust see above it does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year the funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes special power of appointment trust spa trust a trust implementing a special power of appointment to provide asset protection features spendthrift trust it is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending it gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary standby trust or pourover trust the trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death this is a statutory trust statutory business trust a trust created pursuant to a states business trust statute used primarily for commercial purposes two prominent variants of statutory business trusts are delaware statutory trusts and massachusetts business trusts the uniform law commission promulgated a final amended draft of the uniform statutory entity act 00 in 0 as of  january 0 no states have adopted the uniform statutory entity act of 00 testamentary trust or will trust a trust created in an individuals will is called a testamentary trust because a will can become effective only upon death a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlors death unit trust a trust where the beneficiaries called unitholders each possess a certain share called units and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess a unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment rather than disposition as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary regional variationsedit trusts originated in england and therefore english trusts law has had a significant influence particularly among common law legal systems such as the united states and the countries of the commonwealth trust law in civil law jurisdictions generally including continental europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions eg curaçao liechtenstein and sint maarten the trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases for example within the brussels regime europe and the parties to the hague trust convention tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that european countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts united statesedit main article united states trust law state law applies to trusts and the uniform trust code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states in addition federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the internal revenue service may affect the structure and creation of trusts the common law of trusts is summarized in the restatements of the law such as the restatement of trusts third 00−0 in the united states the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations partnerships or not at all depending on the circumstances although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations for example the trustpreferred security is a hybrid debt and equity security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks balance sheets the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of large banks regulatory capital0 estate planningedit main article estate planning living trusts as opposed to testamentary will trusts may help a trustor avoid probate avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular probate is potentially costly and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses the expense of trust administration and a lack of certain safeguards the cost of the trust may be  of the estate per year versus the onetime probate cost of  to  for probate which applies whether or not there is a drafted will unlike trusts wills must be signed by two to three witnesses the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedents assets from mismanagement or embezzlement such as requirements of bonding insurance and itemized accountings of probate assets estate tax effectedit living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the us federal estate tax married couples may however effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause for a living trust the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument living trusts also in practical terms tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations if a living trust fails the property will usually be held for the grantorsettlor on resulting trusts which in some notable cases has had catastrophic tax consequencescitation needed south africaedit in many ways trusts in south africa operate similarly to other common law countries although the law of south africa is actually a hybrid of the british common law system and romandutch law in south africa in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ inherited from the romandutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust although this is regarded by modern dutch law as not actually a trust bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantagescitation needed in south africa minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution the guardians fund and released to the children in adulthood therefore testamentary will trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children there are two types of living trusts in south africa namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts in vested trusts the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit asset protectionedit until recently there were tax advantages to living trusts in south africa although most of these advantages have been removed protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage with notable exceptions assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust under the insolvency act act  of  assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for  months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer or  months if heshe is insolvent at the time of transfer after  months creditors have no claim against assets in the trust although they can attempt to attach the loan account thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust through a loan granted to the trust or donating cash to it any natural person can donate r00  per year without attracting donations tax 0 donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year tax considerationsedit under south african law living trusts are considered tax payers two types of tax apply to living trusts namely income tax and capital gains tax cgt a trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 0 individuals pay according to income scales usually less than 0 the trusts income can however be taxed in the hands of either the trust or the beneficiary a trust pays cgt at the rate of 0 individuals pay 0 trusts do not pay deceased estate tax although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax the taxpayer whose residence has

evidence v t e a trust is a threeparty fiduciary relationship in which the first party the trustor or settlor transfers settles a property often but not necessarily a sum of money upon the second party the trustee for the benefit of the third party the beneficiary  at least two of the three parties must be different individuals or business entities that is one person can be trustor and trustee and another can be beneficiary or one can be trustor and beneficiary and another be trustee or one person can be trustor and another can be trustee and beneficiary a testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor an inter vivos trust is created during the settlors lifetime by a trust instrument a trust may be revocable or irrevocable in the united states a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable except in california oklahoma and texas in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable an irrevocable trust can be broken revoked only by a judicial proceeding trusts and similar relationships have existed since roman times the trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who isare the equitable owners of the trust property trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners they must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses a court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches hisher fiduciary duty some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law a trustee can be a natural person a business entity or a public body a trust itself is a distinct entity from its trustee and in the united states is subject to federal and state taxation trusts can be incorporated or formed into limited liability companies with the business entity acting as both trustor and trustee contents  overview  history english common law  significance  basic principles  terminology  creation

considerations  see also  notes 0 references  further reading overviewedit a trust is created by a settlor who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries the trust is governed by the terms under which it was created in most jurisdictions this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed it is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties and for multiple individuals to share a single rolecitation needed for example in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiariescitation needed trusts have existed since roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states so statements in this article are generalizations understanding the jurisdictionspecific case law involved is tricky some us states are adapting the uniform trust code to codify and harmonize their trust laws but statespecific variations still remain an owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee separating the propertys legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits this may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent incapacitated or deceased testamentary trusts may be created in wills defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries while the trustee is given legal title to the trust property in accepting the property title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries the primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty the duty of prudence the duty of impartiality a trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior to ensure beneficiaries receive their due trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties including a duties of openness and transparency duties of recordkeeping accounting and disclosure in addition a trustee has a duty to know understand and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties there are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests courts can reverse a trustees actions order profits returned and impose other sanctions if it finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures it is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement history english common lawedit main article history of trusts roman law had a welldeveloped concept of the trust fideicommissum in terms of testamentary trusts created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos living trusts which apply while the creator lives this was created by later common law jurisdictions personal trust law developed in england at the time of the crusades during the th and th centuries in medieval english trust law the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use or cestui que trust at the time land ownership in england was based on the feudal system when a landowner left england to fight in the crusades he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return however crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return unfortunately for the crusader english common law did not recognize his claim as far as the kings courts were concerned the land belonged to the trustee who was under no obligation to return it the crusader had no legal claim the disgruntled crusader would then petition the king who would refer the matter to his lord chancellor the lord chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience at this time the principle of equity was born the lord chancellor would consider it unconscionable that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the crusader the true owner therefore he would find in favor of the returning crusader over time it became known that the lord chancellors court the court of chancery would continually recognize the claim of a returning crusader the legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested the crusader was the beneficiary and the acquaintance the trustee the term use of land was coined and in time developed into what we now know as a trust significanceedit the trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the english legal systemverification needed today trusts play a significant role in most common law systems and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes in curaçao for example the trust was enacted into law on  january 0 however the curaçao civil code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument france has recently added a similar romanlawbased device to its own law with the fiducie amended in 00 the fiducie unlike a trust is a contractual relationship trusts are widely used internationally especially in countries within the english law sphere of influence and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems they do recognise the concept under the hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition partly only the extent that they are parties thereto the hague convention also regulates conflict of trusts although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers they have become very important in american capital markets particularly through pension funds in certain countries essentially always trusts and mutual funds often trusts basic principlesedit property of any sort may be held in a trust the uses of trusts are many and varied for both personal and commercial reasons and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning asset protection and taxes living trusts may be created during a persons life through the drafting of a trust instrument or after death in a will in a relevant sense a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors investors are also the beneficiaries this is particularly evident in the delaware business trust which could theoretically with the language in the governing instrument be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation– although traditionally the massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the us one of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee multiple beneficiaries and their respective creditors particularly the trustees creditors making it bankruptcy remote and leading to its use in pensions mutual funds and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust terminologyedit chart of a trust appointer this is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one this person is usually mentioned in the trust deed appointment in trust law appointment often has its everyday meaning it is common to talk of the appointment of a trustee for example however appointment also has a technical trust law meaning either the act of appointing ie giving an asset from the trust to a beneficiary usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust or the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment the trustees right to do this where it exists is called a power of appointment sometimes a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee such as the settlor the protector or a beneficiary as trustee for atf this is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee beneficiary a beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns in its own capacity iioc this term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf protector a protector may be appointed in an express inter vivos trust as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another the legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate noone doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities if a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees however a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one also protectors are comparatively new while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years it is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties and by others that they do not the case law has not yet established this point settlors this is the person or persons who creates the trust grantors is a common synonym terms of the trust means the settlors wishes expressed in the trust instrument trust deed a trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee beneficiaries settlor and appointer and the terms and conditions of the agreement trust distributions a trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust trustee a person either an individual a corporation or more than one of either who administers a trust a trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trusts beneficiaries creationedit trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor express trusts0 or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts an implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties implied trusts are divided into two categories resulting and constructive a resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent a constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties regardless of their intentions typically a trust can be created in the following ways a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees often referred to as an inter vivos or living trust an oral declaration the will of a decedent usually called a testamentary trust or a court order for example in family proceedings in some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document formalitiesedit generally a trust requires three certainties as determined in knight v knight intention there must be a clear intention to create a trustre adams and the kensington vestry subject matter the property subject to the trust must be clearly identified palmer v simmonds one may not for example state settle the majority of my estate as the precise extent cannot be ascertained trust property may be any form of specific property be it real or personal tangible or intangible it is often for example real estate shares or cash objects the beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified or at least be ascertainable re hains settlement in the case of discretionary trusts where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries mcphail v doulton beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust for example my future grandchildren alternatively the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries trusteesedit a trust may have multiple trustees and these trustees are the legal owners of the trusts property but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties such as a duty of care and a duty to inform if trustees do not adhere to these duties they may be removed through a legal action the trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees a trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument if a trust lacks a trustee a court may appoint a trustee the trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust the trusts affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries filing required tax returns and other duties in some cases dependent upon the trust instrument the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit a trustee may be held personally liable for problems although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased for example a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested in addition a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given however in the united states similar to directors and officers an exculpatory clause may minimize liability although this was previously held to be against public policy this position has changed in the united states the uniform trust code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts although trustees may be unpaid commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about  of assets under management0 beneficiariesedit the beneficiaries are beneficial or equitable owners of the trust property either immediately or eventually the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property or they will receive the property itself the extent of a beneficiarys interest depends on the wording of the trust document one beneficiary may be entitled to income for example interest from a bank account whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twentyfive years the settlor has much discretion when creating the trust subject to some limitations imposed by law the beneficiaries are jocosely known as trust fund babies or trustafarians purposesedit common purposes for trusts include privacy trusts may be created purely for privacy the terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions while the terms of a trust are not spendthrift clauses trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries for example ones children against their own inability to handle money these are especially attractive for spendthrifts courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors but not against creditors of a settlorcitation needed wills and estate planning trusts frequently appear in wills indeed technically the administration of every deceaseds estate is a form of trust conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceaseds spouse if any and then to the children equally if the children are under  or under some other age mentioned in the will  and  are common a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached the executor of the will is usually the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries the trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority charities in some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts in others corporations may be charities also in most jurisdictions charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit in england for example by the charity commission unit trusts the trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle the unit trust pension plans pension plans are typically set up as a trust with the employer as settlor and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries remuneration trusts trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents this form of trust was developed by paul baxendalewalker and has since gained widespread use corporate structures complex business arrangements most often in the finance and insurance sectors sometimes use trusts among various other entities eg corporations in their structure asset protection trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote for example a discretionary trust of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary in such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them and therefore in theory protected from creditors in addition the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name eg the teddy bear trust these strategies are ethically and legally controversial tax planning the tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route if indeed it would be possible to do so in many cases the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance for an example see the nilband discretionary trust explained at inheritance tax united kingdom coownership ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust in particular ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee construction law in canada and minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust in the event of contractor insolvency this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed legal retainer lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolventcitation needed however strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts typesedit alphabetic list of trust typesedit trusts go by many different names depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes a single trust might accurately be described in several ways for example a living trust is often an express trust which is also a revocable trust and might include an incentive trust and so forth community land trust a community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing community gardens civic buildings commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community “clts” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability economic diversity and local access to essential services constructive trust unlike an express trust a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee a constructive trust is imposed by the law as an equitable remedy this generally occurs due to some wrongdoing where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it a constructive trust is essentially a legal fiction for example a court of equity recognizing a plaintiffs request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them the constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization the distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust the latter is an equitable remedy imposed by law being truly remedial the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property discretionary trust in a discretionary trust certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary ie whether there is a class of beneficiaries which a person can be said to belong to in that way persons who satisfy that criterion who are members of that class can enforce the trust re baden’s deed trusts mcphail v doulton directed trust in these types a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trusts execution these participants may include a distribution committee trust protector or investment advisor the directed trustees role is administrative which involves following investment instructions holding legal title to the trust assets providing fiduciary and tax accounting coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants dynasty trust also known as a generationskipping trust a type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantors grandchildren not the grantors children the children of the grantor never take title to the assets this allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first generationskipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantors children however because any income generated by the trusts assets can be made accessible to the grantors children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren express trust an express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust over their assets either now or upon his or her later death in these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument which will either be a will or a trust deed almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type they contrast with resulting and constructive trusts the intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct for an express trust to exist there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property in the usa statute of frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value or is real estate fixed trust in a fixed trust the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor the trustee has little or no discretion common examples are a trust for a minor to x if she attains  a life interest to pay the income to x for her lifetime and a remainder to pay the capital to y after the death of x grantor retained annuity trust grat grat is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers assets as a gift into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument at the end of the term the financial property is transferred taxfree to the named beneficiaries this trust is commonly used in the us to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax hybrid trust a hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts in a hybrid trust the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor but the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property once these fixed amounts have been paid out is to be paid to the beneficiaries implied trust an implied trust as distinct from an express trust is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist a resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for in such a case the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor the creator of the trust in other words the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document improvement trust improvement trusts can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area the trust is often run by a committee and can act similarly to a development agency depending on the provisions of its charter incentive trust a trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary the term incentive trust is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee inter vivos trust or living trust a settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust irrevocable trust in contrast to a revocable trust an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed although in rare cases a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust land trust a private nonprofit organization that as all or part of its mission actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition or by its stewardship of such land or easements or an agreement whereby one party the trustee agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party the beneficiary offshore trust strictly speaking an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident however the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or colloquially as tax havens offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law

and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury private and public trusts a private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary by contrast a public trust also called a charitable trust has some charitable end as its beneficiary in order to qualify as a charitable trust the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as

a charitable trust by analogy charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation protective trust here the terminology is different between the uk and the usa in the uk a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest they have become comparatively rare in the usa a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning in another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust often a person a wishes to leave property to another person b a however fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before a dies and that therefore b would receive none of it a could establish a trust with b as the beneficiary but then a would not be entitled to use of the property before they died protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation a would establish a trust with both a and b as beneficiaries with the trustee instructed to allow a use of the property until they died and thereafter to allow its use to b the property is then safe from being claimed by as creditors at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment this use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders and is frequently used as an alternative to them purpose trust or more accurately noncharitable purpose trust all charitable trusts are purpose trusts generally the law does not permit noncharitable purpose

among common law legal systems such as the united states and the countries of the commonwealth trust law in civil law jurisdictions generally including continental europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions eg curaçao liechtenstein and sint maarten the trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases for example within the brussels regime europe and the parties to the hague trust convention tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that european countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts united statesedit main article united states trust law state law applies to trusts and the uniform trust code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states in addition federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the internal revenue service may affect the structure and creation of trusts the common law of trusts is summarized in the restatements of the law such as the restatement of trusts third 00−0 in the united states the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations partnerships or not at all depending on the circumstances although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations for example the trustpreferred security is a hybrid debt and equity security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks balance sheets the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of large banks regulatory capital0 estate planningedit main article estate planning living trusts as opposed to testamentary will trusts may help a trustor avoid probate avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular probate is potentially costly and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses the expense of trust administration and a lack of certain safeguards the cost of the trust may be  of the estate per year versus the onetime probate cost of  to  for probate which applies whether or not there is a drafted will unlike trusts wills must be signed by two to three witnesses the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedents assets from mismanagement or embezzlement such as requirements of bonding insurance and itemized accountings of probate assets estate tax effectedit living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the us federal estate tax married couples may however effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause for a living trust the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument living trusts also in practical terms tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations if a living trust fails the property will usually be held for the grantorsettlor on resulting trusts which in some notable cases has had catastrophic tax consequencescitation needed south africaedit in many ways trusts in south africa operate similarly to other common law countries although the law of south africa is actually a hybrid of the british common law system and romandutch law in south africa in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ inherited from the romandutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust although this is regarded by modern dutch law as not actually a trust bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantagescitation needed in south africa minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution the guardians fund and released to the children in adulthood therefore testamentary will trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children there are two types of living trusts in south africa namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts in vested trusts the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit asset protectionedit until recently there were tax advantages to living trusts in south africa although most of these advantages have been removed protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage with notable exceptions assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust under the insolvency act act  of  assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for  months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer or  months if heshe is insolvent at the time of transfer after  months creditors have no claim against assets in the trust although they can attempt to attach the loan account thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets

at least two of the three parties must be different individuals or business entities that is one person can be trustor and trustee and another can be beneficiary or one can be trustor and beneficiary and another be trustee or one person can be trustor and another can be trustee and beneficiary a testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor an inter vivos trust is created during the settlors lifetime by a trust instrument a trust may be revocable or irrevocable in the united states a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable except in california oklahoma and texas in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable an irrevocable trust can be broken revoked only by a judicial proceeding trusts and similar relationships have existed since roman times the trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who isare the equitable owners of the trust property trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners they must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses a court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches hisher fiduciary duty some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law a trustee can be a natural person a business entity or a public body a trust itself is a distinct

trust is created by a settlor who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries the trust is governed by the terms under which it was created in most jurisdictions this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed it is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties and for multiple individuals to share a single rolecitation needed for example in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiariescitation needed trusts have existed since roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states so statements in this article are generalizations understanding the jurisdictionspecific case law involved is tricky some us states are adapting the uniform trust code to codify and harmonize their trust laws but statespecific variations still remain an owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee separating the propertys legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits this may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent incapacitated or deceased testamentary trusts may be created in wills defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries while the trustee is given legal title to the trust property in accepting the property title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries the primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty the duty of prudence the duty of impartiality a trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior to ensure beneficiaries receive their due trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties including a duties of openness and transparency duties of recordkeeping accounting and disclosure in addition a trustee has a duty to know understand and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties there are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests courts can reverse a trustees actions order profits returned and impose other sanctions if it finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures it is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement history english common lawedit main article history of trusts roman law had a welldeveloped concept of the trust fideicommissum in terms of testamentary trusts created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos living trusts which apply while the creator lives this was created by later common law jurisdictions personal trust law developed in england at the time of the crusades during the th and th centuries in medieval english trust law the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use or cestui que trust at the time land ownership in england was based on the feudal system when a landowner left england to fight in the crusades he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return however crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return unfortunately for the crusader english common law did not recognize his claim as far as the kings courts were concerned the land belonged to the trustee who was under no obligation to return it the crusader had no legal claim the disgruntled crusader would then petition the king who would refer the matter to his lord chancellor the lord chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience at this time the principle of equity was born the lord chancellor would consider it unconscionable that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the crusader the true owner therefore he would find in favor of the returning crusader over time it became known that the lord chancellors court the court of chancery would continually recognize the claim of a returning crusader the legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested the crusader was the beneficiary and the acquaintance the trustee the term use of land was coined and in time developed into what we now know as a trust significanceedit the trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the english legal systemverification needed today trusts play a significant role in most common law systems and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes in curaçao for example the trust was enacted into law on  january 0 however the curaçao civil code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument france has recently added a similar romanlawbased device to its own law with the fiducie amended in 00 the fiducie unlike a trust is a contractual relationship trusts are widely used internationally especially in countries within the english law sphere of influence and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems they do recognise the concept under the hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition partly only the extent that they are parties thereto the hague convention also regulates conflict of trusts although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers they have become very important in american capital markets particularly through pension funds in certain countries essentially always trusts and mutual funds often trusts basic principlesedit property of any sort may be held in a trust the uses of trusts are many and varied for both personal and commercial reasons and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning asset protection and taxes living trusts may be created during a persons life through the drafting of a trust instrument or after death in a will in a relevant sense a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors investors are also the beneficiaries this is particularly evident in the delaware business trust which could theoretically with the language in the governing instrument be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation– although traditionally the massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the us one of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee multiple beneficiaries and their respective creditors particularly the trustees creditors making it bankruptcy remote and leading to its use in pensions mutual funds and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust terminologyedit chart of a trust appointer this is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one this person is usually mentioned in the trust deed appointment in trust law appointment often has its everyday meaning it is common to talk of the appointment of a trustee for example however appointment also has a technical trust law meaning either the act of appointing ie giving an asset from the trust to a beneficiary usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust or the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment the trustees right to do this where it exists is called a power of appointment sometimes a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee such as the settlor the protector or a beneficiary as trustee for atf this is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee beneficiary a beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns in its own capacity iioc this term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf protector a protector may be appointed in an express inter vivos trust as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another the legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate noone doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities if a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees however a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one also protectors are comparatively new while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years it is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties and by others that they do not the case law has not yet established this point settlors this is the person or persons who creates the trust grantors is a common synonym terms of the trust means the settlors wishes expressed in the trust instrument trust deed a trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee beneficiaries settlor and appointer and the terms and conditions of the agreement trust distributions a trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust trustee a person either an individual a corporation or more than one of either who administers a trust a trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trusts beneficiaries creationedit trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor express trusts0 or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts an implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties implied trusts are divided into two categories resulting and constructive a resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent a constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties regardless of their intentions typically a trust can be created in the following ways a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees often referred to as an inter vivos or living trust an oral declaration the will of a decedent usually called a testamentary trust or a court order for example in family proceedings in some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document formalitiesedit generally a trust requires three certainties as determined in knight v knight intention there must be a clear intention to create a trustre adams and the kensington vestry subject matter the property subject to the trust must be clearly identified palmer v simmonds one may not for example state settle the majority of my estate as the precise extent cannot be ascertained trust property may be any form of specific property be it real or personal tangible or intangible it is often for example real estate shares or cash objects the beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified or at least be ascertainable re hains settlement in the case of discretionary trusts where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries mcphail v doulton beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust for example my future grandchildren alternatively the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries trusteesedit a trust may have multiple trustees and these trustees are the legal owners of the trusts property but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties such as a duty of care and a duty to inform if trustees do not adhere to these duties they may be removed through a legal action the trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees a trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument if a trust lacks a trustee a court may appoint a trustee the trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust the trusts affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries filing required tax returns and other duties in some cases dependent upon the trust instrument the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit a trustee may be held personally liable for problems although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased for example a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested in addition a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given however in the united states similar to directors and officers an exculpatory clause may minimize liability although this was previously held to be against public policy this position has changed in the united states the uniform trust code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts although trustees may be unpaid commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about  of assets under management0 beneficiariesedit the beneficiaries are beneficial or equitable owners of the trust property either immediately or eventually the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property or they will receive the property itself the extent of a beneficiarys interest depends on the wording of the trust document one beneficiary may be entitled to income for example interest from a bank account whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twentyfive years the settlor has much discretion when creating the trust subject to some limitations imposed by law the beneficiaries are jocosely known as trust fund babies or trustafarians purposesedit common purposes for trusts include privacy trusts may be created purely for privacy the terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions while the terms of a trust are not spendthrift clauses trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries for example ones children against their own inability to handle money these are especially attractive for spendthrifts courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors but not against creditors of a settlorcitation needed wills and estate planning trusts frequently appear in wills indeed technically the administration of every deceaseds estate is a form of trust conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceaseds spouse if any and then to the children equally if the children are under  or under some other age mentioned in the will  and  are common a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached the executor of the will is usually the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries the trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority charities in some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts in others corporations may be charities also in most jurisdictions charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit in england for example by the charity commission unit trusts the trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle the unit trust pension plans pension plans are typically set up as a trust with the employer as settlor and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries remuneration trusts trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents this form of trust was developed by paul baxendalewalker and has since gained widespread use corporate structures complex business arrangements most often in the finance and insurance sectors sometimes use trusts among various other entities eg corporations in their structure asset protection trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote for example a discretionary trust of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary in such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them and therefore in theory protected from creditors in addition the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name eg the teddy bear trust these strategies are ethically and legally controversial tax planning the tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route if indeed it would be possible to do so in many cases the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance for an example see the nilband discretionary trust explained at inheritance tax united kingdom coownership ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust in particular ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee construction law in canada and minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust in the event of contractor insolvency this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed legal retainer lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolventcitation needed however strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts typesedit alphabetic list of trust typesedit trusts go by many different names depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes a single trust might accurately be described in several ways for example a living trust is often an express trust which is also a revocable trust and might include an incentive trust and so forth community land trust a community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing community gardens civic buildings commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community “clts” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability economic diversity and local access to essential services constructive trust unlike an express trust a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee a constructive trust is imposed by the law as an equitable remedy this generally occurs due to some wrongdoing where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it a constructive trust is essentially a legal fiction for example a court of equity recognizing a plaintiffs request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them the constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization the distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust the latter is an equitable remedy imposed by law being truly remedial the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property discretionary trust in a discretionary trust certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary ie whether there is a class of beneficiaries which a person can be said to belong to in that way persons who satisfy that criterion who are members of that class can enforce the trust re baden’s deed trusts mcphail v doulton directed trust in these types a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trusts execution these participants may include a distribution committee trust protector or investment advisor the directed trustees role is administrative which involves following investment instructions holding legal title to the trust assets providing fiduciary and tax accounting coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants dynasty trust also known as a generationskipping trust a type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantors grandchildren not the grantors children the children of the grantor never take title to the assets this allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first generationskipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantors children however because any income generated by the trusts assets can be made accessible to the grantors children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren express trust an express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust over their assets either now or upon his or her later death in these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument which will either be a will or a trust deed almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type they contrast with resulting and constructive trusts the intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct for an express trust to exist there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property in the usa statute of frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value or is real estate fixed trust in a fixed trust the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor the trustee has little or no discretion common examples are a trust for a minor to x if she attains  a life interest to pay the income to x for her lifetime and a remainder to pay the capital to y after the death of x grantor retained annuity trust grat grat is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers assets as a gift into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument at the end of the term the financial property is transferred taxfree to the named beneficiaries this trust is commonly used in the us to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax hybrid trust a hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts in a hybrid trust the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor but the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property once these fixed amounts have been paid out is to be paid to the beneficiaries implied trust an implied trust as distinct from an express trust is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist a resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for in such a case the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor the creator of the trust in other words the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document improvement trust improvement trusts can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area the trust is often run by a committee and can act similarly to a development agency depending on the provisions of its charter incentive trust a trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary the term incentive trust is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee inter vivos trust or living trust a settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust irrevocable trust in contrast to a revocable trust an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed although in rare cases a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust land trust a private nonprofit organization that as all or part of its mission actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition or by its stewardship of such land or easements or an agreement whereby one party the trustee agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party the beneficiary offshore trust strictly speaking an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident however the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or colloquially as tax havens offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions by extension onshore trust has come to mean any trust resident in a hightax jurisdiction personal injury trust a personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury private and public trusts a private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary by contrast a public trust also called a charitable trust has some charitable end as its beneficiary in order to qualify as a charitable trust the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty providing education carrying out some religious purpose etc the permissible objects are generally set out in legislation but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust by analogy charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation protective trust here the terminology is different between the uk and the usa in the uk a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest they have become comparatively rare in the usa a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning in another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust often a person a wishes to leave property to another person b a however fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before a dies and that therefore b would receive none of it a could establish a trust with b as the beneficiary but then a would not be entitled to use of the property before they died protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation a would establish a trust with both a and b as beneficiaries with the trustee instructed to allow a use of the property until they died and thereafter to allow its use to b the property is then safe from being claimed by as creditors at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment this use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders and is frequently used as an alternative to them purpose trust or more accurately noncharitable purpose trust all charitable trusts are purpose trusts generally the law does not permit noncharitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law and arguable quistclose trusts certain jurisdictions principally offshore jurisdictions have enacted legislation validating noncharitable purpose trusts generally qtip trust short for qualified terminal interest property a trust recognized under the tax laws of the united states which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax resulting trust a resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where  a trust fails wholly or in part as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets or  a voluntary payment is made by a to b in circumstances which do not suggest gifting b becomes the resulting trustee of as payment revocable trust a trust of this kind may be amended altered or revoked by its settlor at any time provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the us as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a persons final affairs after death secret trust a post mortem trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one or more legatees of a will semisecret trust a trust in which a will demonstrates the intention to create a trust names a trustee but does not identify the intended beneficiary simple trust in the us jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings in a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust this is also called a bare trust all other trusts are special trusts where the trustee has active duties beyond this a simple trust in federal income tax law is one in which under the terms of the trust document all net income must be distributed on an annual basis in the uk a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is  in england and wales or  in scotland special trust in the us a special trust also called complex trust contrasts with a simple trust see above it does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year the funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes special power of appointment trust spa trust a trust implementing a special power of appointment to provide asset protection features spendthrift trust it is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending it gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary standby trust or pourover trust the trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death this is a statutory trust statutory business trust a trust created pursuant to a states business trust statute used primarily for commercial purposes two prominent variants of statutory business trusts are delaware statutory trusts and massachusetts business trusts the uniform law commission promulgated a final amended draft of the uniform statutory entity act 00 in 0 as of  january 0 no states have adopted the uniform statutory entity act of 00 testamentary trust or will trust a trust created in an individuals will is called a testamentary trust because a will can become effective only upon death a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlors death unit trust a trust where the beneficiaries called unitholders each possess a certain share called units and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess a unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment rather than disposition as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary regional variationsedit trusts originated in england and therefore english trusts law has had a significant influence particularly among common law legal systems such as the united states and the countries of the commonwealth trust law in civil law jurisdictions generally including continental europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions eg curaçao liechtenstein and sint maarten the trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases for example within the brussels regime europe and the parties to the hague trust convention tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that european countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts united statesedit main article united states trust law state law applies to trusts and the uniform trust code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states in addition federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the internal revenue service may affect the structure and creation of trusts the common law of trusts is summarized in the restatements of the law such as the restatement of trusts third 00−0 in the united states the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations partnerships or not at all depending on the circumstances although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations for example the trustpreferred security is a hybrid debt and equity security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks balance sheets the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of large banks regulatory capital0 estate planningedit main article estate planning living trusts as opposed to testamentary will trusts may help a trustor avoid probate avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular probate is potentially costly and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses the expense of trust administration and a lack of certain safeguards the cost of the trust may be  of the estate per year versus the onetime probate cost of  to  for probate which applies whether or not there is a drafted will unlike trusts wills must be signed by two to three witnesses the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedents assets from mismanagement or embezzlement such as requirements of bonding insurance and itemized accountings of probate assets estate tax effectedit living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the us federal estate tax married couples may however effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause for a living trust the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument living trusts also in practical terms tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations if a living trust fails the property will usually be held for the grantorsettlor on resulting trusts which in some notable cases has had catastrophic tax consequencescitation needed south africaedit in many ways trusts in south africa operate similarly to other common law countries although the law of south africa is actually a hybrid of the british common law system and romandutch law in south africa in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ inherited from the romandutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust although this is regarded by modern dutch law as not actually a trust bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantagescitation needed in south africa minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution the guardians fund and released to the children in adulthood therefore testamentary will trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children there are two types of living trusts in south africa namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts in vested trusts the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit asset protectionedit until recently there were tax advantages to living trusts in south africa although most of these advantages have been removed protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage with notable exceptions assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust under the insolvency act act  of  assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for  months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer or  months if heshe is insolvent at the time of transfer after  months creditors have no claim against assets in the trust although they can attempt to attach the loan account thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust through a loan granted to the trust or donating cash to it any natural person can donate r00  per year without attracting donations tax 0 donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year tax considerationsedit under south african law

deceased estate tax although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax the taxpayer whose residence has

it is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties and for multiple individuals to share a single rolecitation needed for example in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiariescitation needed trusts have existed since roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states so statements in this article are generalizations understanding the jurisdictionspecific case law involved is tricky some us states are adapting the uniform trust code to codify and harmonize their trust laws but statespecific variations still remain an owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee separating the propertys legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits this may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent incapacitated or deceased testamentary trusts may be created in wills defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries while the trustee is given legal title to the trust property in accepting the property title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries the primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty the duty of prudence the duty of impartiality a trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior to ensure beneficiaries receive their due trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties including a duties of openness and transparency duties of recordkeeping accounting and disclosure in addition a trustee has a duty to know understand and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties there are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests courts can reverse a trustees actions order profits returned and impose other sanctions if it finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures it is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement history english common lawedit main article history of trusts roman law had a welldeveloped concept of the trust fideicommissum in terms of testamentary trusts created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos living trusts which apply while the creator lives this was created by later common law jurisdictions personal trust law developed in england at the time of the crusades during the th and th centuries in medieval english trust law the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use or cestui que trust at the time land ownership in england was based on the feudal system when a landowner left england to fight in the crusades he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return however crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return unfortunately for the crusader english common law did not recognize his claim as far as the kings courts were concerned the land belonged to the trustee who was under no obligation to return it the crusader had no legal claim the disgruntled crusader would then petition the king who would refer the matter to his lord chancellor the lord chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience at this time the principle of equity was born the lord chancellor would consider it unconscionable that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the crusader the true owner therefore he would find in favor of the returning crusader over time it became known that the lord chancellors court the court of chancery would continually recognize the claim of a returning crusader the legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested the crusader was the beneficiary and the acquaintance the trustee the term use of land was coined and in time developed into what we now know as a trust significanceedit the trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the english legal systemverification needed today trusts play a significant role in most common law systems and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes in curaçao for example the trust was enacted into law on  january 0 however the curaçao civil code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument france has recently added a similar romanlawbased device to its own law with the fiducie amended in 00 the fiducie unlike a trust is a contractual relationship trusts are widely used internationally especially in countries within the english law sphere of influence and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems they do recognise the concept under the hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition partly only the extent that they are parties thereto the hague convention also regulates conflict of trusts although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers they have become very important in american capital markets particularly through pension funds in certain countries essentially always trusts and mutual funds often trusts basic principlesedit property of any sort may be held in a trust the uses of trusts are many and varied for both personal and commercial reasons and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning asset protection and taxes living trusts may be created during a persons life through the drafting of a trust instrument or after death in a will in a relevant sense a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors investors are also the beneficiaries this is particularly evident in the delaware business trust which could theoretically with the language in the governing instrument be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation– although traditionally the massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the us one of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee multiple beneficiaries and their respective creditors particularly the trustees creditors making it bankruptcy remote and leading to its use in pensions mutual funds and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust terminologyedit chart of a trust appointer this is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one this person is usually mentioned in the trust deed appointment in trust law appointment often has its everyday meaning it is common to talk of the appointment of a trustee for example however appointment also has a technical trust law meaning either the act of appointing ie giving an asset from the trust to a beneficiary usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust or the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment the trustees right to do this where it exists is called a power of appointment sometimes a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee such as the settlor the protector or a beneficiary as trustee for atf this is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee beneficiary a beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns in its own capacity iioc this term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf protector a protector may be appointed in an express inter vivos trust as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another the legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate noone doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities if a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees however a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one also protectors are comparatively new while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years it is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties and by others that they do not the case law has not yet established this point settlors this is the person or persons who creates the trust grantors is a common synonym terms of the trust means the settlors wishes expressed in the trust instrument trust deed a trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee beneficiaries settlor and appointer and the terms and conditions of the agreement trust distributions a trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust trustee a person either an individual a corporation or more than one of either who administers a trust a trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trusts beneficiaries creationedit trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor express trusts0 or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts an implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties implied trusts are divided into two categories resulting and constructive a resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent a constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties regardless of their intentions typically a trust can be created in the following ways a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees often referred to as an inter vivos or living trust an oral declaration the will of a decedent usually called a testamentary trust or a court order for example in family proceedings in some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document formalitiesedit generally a trust requires three certainties as determined in knight v knight intention there must be a clear intention to create a trustre adams and the kensington vestry subject matter the property subject to the trust must be clearly identified palmer v simmonds one may not for example state settle the majority of my estate as the precise extent cannot be ascertained trust property may be any form of specific property be it real or personal tangible or intangible it is often for example real estate shares or cash objects the beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified or at least be ascertainable re hains settlement in the case of discretionary trusts where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries mcphail v doulton beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust for example my future grandchildren alternatively the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries trusteesedit a trust may have multiple trustees and these trustees are the legal owners of the trusts property but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties such as a duty of care and a duty to inform if trustees do not adhere to these duties they may be removed through a legal action the trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees a trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument if a trust lacks a trustee a court may appoint a trustee the trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust the trusts affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries filing required tax returns and other duties in some cases dependent upon the trust instrument the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit a trustee may be held personally liable for problems although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased for example a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested in addition a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given however in the united states similar to directors and officers an exculpatory clause may minimize liability although this was previously held to be against public policy this position has changed in the united states the uniform trust code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts although trustees may be unpaid commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about  of assets under management0 beneficiariesedit the beneficiaries are beneficial or equitable owners of the trust property either immediately or eventually the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property or they will receive the property itself the extent of a beneficiarys interest depends on the wording of the trust document one beneficiary may be entitled to income for example interest from a bank account whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twentyfive years the settlor has much discretion when creating the trust subject to some limitations imposed by law the beneficiaries are jocosely known as trust fund babies or trustafarians purposesedit common purposes for trusts include privacy trusts may be created purely for privacy the terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions while the terms of a trust are not spendthrift clauses trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries for example ones children against their own inability to handle money these are especially attractive for spendthrifts courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors but not against creditors of a settlorcitation needed wills and estate planning trusts frequently appear in wills indeed technically the administration of every deceaseds estate is a form of trust conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceaseds spouse if any and then to the children equally if the children are under  or under some other age mentioned in the will  and  are common a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached the executor of the will is usually the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries the trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority charities in some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts in others corporations may be charities also in most jurisdictions charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit in england for example by the charity commission unit trusts the trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle the unit trust pension plans pension plans are typically set up as a trust with the employer as settlor and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries remuneration trusts trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents this form of trust was developed by paul baxendalewalker and has since gained widespread use corporate structures complex business arrangements most often in the finance and insurance sectors sometimes use trusts among various other entities eg corporations in their structure asset protection trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote for example a discretionary trust of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary in such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them and therefore in theory protected from creditors in addition the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name eg the teddy bear trust these strategies are ethically and legally controversial tax planning the tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route if indeed it would be possible to do so in many cases the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance for an example see the nilband discretionary trust explained at inheritance tax united kingdom coownership ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust in particular ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee construction law in canada and minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust in the event of contractor insolvency this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed legal retainer lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolventcitation needed however strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts typesedit alphabetic list of trust typesedit trusts go by many different names depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes a single trust might accurately be described in several ways for example a living trust is often an express trust which is also a revocable trust and might include an incentive trust and so forth community land trust a community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing community gardens civic buildings commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community “clts” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability economic diversity and local access to essential services constructive trust unlike an express trust a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee a constructive trust is imposed by the law as an equitable remedy this generally occurs due to some wrongdoing where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it a constructive trust is essentially a legal fiction for example a court of equity recognizing a plaintiffs request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them the constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization the distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust the latter is an equitable remedy imposed by law being truly remedial the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property discretionary trust in a discretionary trust certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary ie whether there is a class of beneficiaries which a person can be said to belong to in that way persons who satisfy that criterion who are members of that class can enforce the trust re baden’s deed trusts mcphail v doulton directed trust in these types a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trusts execution these participants may include a distribution committee trust protector or investment advisor the directed trustees role is administrative which involves following investment instructions holding legal title to the trust assets providing fiduciary and tax accounting coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants dynasty trust also known as a generationskipping trust a type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantors grandchildren not the grantors children the children of the grantor never take title to the assets this allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first generationskipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantors children however because any income generated by the trusts assets can be made accessible to the grantors children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren express trust an express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust over their assets either now or upon his or her later death in these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument which will either be a will or a trust deed almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type they contrast with resulting and constructive trusts the intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct for an express trust to exist there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property in the usa statute of frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value or is real estate fixed trust in a fixed trust the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor the trustee has little or no discretion common examples are a trust for a minor to x if she attains  a life interest to pay the income to x for her lifetime and a remainder to pay the capital to y after the death of x grantor retained annuity trust grat grat is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers assets as a gift into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument at the end of the term the financial property is transferred taxfree to the named beneficiaries this trust is commonly used in the us to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax hybrid trust a hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts in a hybrid trust the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor but the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property once these fixed amounts have been paid out is to be paid to the beneficiaries implied trust an implied trust as distinct from an express trust is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist a resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for in such a case the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor the creator of the trust in other words the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document improvement trust improvement trusts can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area the trust is often run by a committee and can act similarly to a development agency depending on the provisions of its charter incentive trust a trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary the term incentive trust is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee inter vivos trust or living trust a settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust irrevocable trust in contrast to a revocable trust an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed although in rare cases a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust land trust a private nonprofit organization that as all or part of its mission actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition or by its stewardship of such land or easements or an agreement whereby one party the trustee agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party the beneficiary offshore trust strictly speaking an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident however the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or colloquially as tax havens offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions by extension onshore trust has come to mean any trust resident in a hightax jurisdiction personal injury trust a personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury private and public trusts a private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary by contrast a public trust also called a charitable trust has some charitable end as its beneficiary in order to qualify as a charitable trust the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty providing education carrying out some religious purpose etc the permissible objects are generally set out in legislation but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust by analogy charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation protective trust here the terminology is different between the uk and the usa in the uk a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest they have become comparatively rare in the usa a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning in another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust often a person a wishes to leave property to another person b a however fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before a dies and that therefore b would receive none of it a could establish a trust with b as the beneficiary but then a would not be entitled to use of the property before they died protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation a would establish a trust with both a and b as beneficiaries with the trustee instructed to allow a use of the property until they died and thereafter to allow its use to b the property is then safe from being claimed by as creditors at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment this use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders and is frequently used as an alternative to them purpose trust or more accurately noncharitable purpose trust all charitable trusts are purpose trusts generally the law does not permit noncharitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law and arguable quistclose trusts certain jurisdictions principally offshore jurisdictions have enacted legislation validating noncharitable purpose trusts generally qtip trust short for qualified terminal interest property a trust recognized under the tax laws of the united states which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax resulting trust a resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where  a trust fails wholly or in part as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets or  a voluntary payment is made by a to b in circumstances which do not suggest gifting b becomes the resulting trustee of as payment revocable trust a trust of this kind may be amended altered or revoked by its settlor at any time provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the us as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a persons final affairs after death secret trust a post mortem trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one or more legatees of a will semisecret trust a trust in which a will demonstrates the intention to create a trust names a trustee but does not identify the intended beneficiary simple trust in the us jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings in a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust this is also called a bare trust all other trusts are special trusts where the trustee has active duties beyond this a simple trust in federal income tax law is one in which under the terms of the trust document all net income must be distributed on an annual basis in the uk a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is  in england and wales or  in scotland special trust in the us a special trust also called complex trust contrasts with a simple trust see above it does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year the funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes special power of appointment trust spa trust a trust implementing a special power of appointment to provide asset protection features spendthrift trust it is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending it gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary standby trust or pourover trust the trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death this is a statutory trust statutory business trust a trust created pursuant to a states business trust statute used primarily for commercial purposes two prominent variants of statutory business trusts are delaware statutory trusts and massachusetts business trusts the uniform law commission promulgated a final amended draft of the uniform statutory entity act 00 in 0 as of  january 0 no states have adopted the uniform statutory entity act of 00 testamentary trust or will trust a trust created in an individuals will is called a testamentary trust because a will can become effective only upon death a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlors death unit trust a trust where the beneficiaries called unitholders each possess a certain share called units and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess a unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment rather than disposition as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary regional variationsedit trusts originated in england and therefore english trusts law has had a significant influence particularly among common law legal systems such as the united states and the countries of the commonwealth trust law in civil law jurisdictions generally including continental europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions eg curaçao liechtenstein and sint maarten the trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases for example within the brussels regime europe and the parties to the hague trust convention tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that european countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts united statesedit main article united states trust law state law applies to trusts and the uniform trust code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states in addition federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the internal revenue service may affect the structure and creation of trusts the common law of trusts is summarized in the restatements of the law such as the restatement of trusts third 00−0 in the united states the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations partnerships or not at all depending on the circumstances although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations for example the trustpreferred security is a hybrid debt and equity security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks balance sheets the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of large banks regulatory capital0 estate planningedit main article estate planning living trusts as opposed to testamentary will trusts may help a trustor avoid probate avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular probate is potentially costly and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses the expense of trust administration and a lack of certain safeguards the cost of the trust may be  of the estate per year versus the onetime probate cost of  to  for probate which applies whether or not there is a drafted will unlike trusts wills must be signed by two to three witnesses the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedents assets from mismanagement or embezzlement such as requirements of bonding insurance and itemized accountings of probate assets estate tax effectedit living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the us federal estate tax married couples may however effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause for a living trust the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument living trusts also in practical terms tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations if a living trust fails the property will usually be held for the grantorsettlor on resulting trusts which in some notable cases has had catastrophic tax consequencescitation needed south africaedit in many ways trusts in south africa operate similarly to other common law countries although the law of south africa is actually a hybrid of the british common law system and romandutch law in south africa in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ inherited from the romandutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust although this is regarded by modern dutch law as not actually a trust bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantagescitation needed in south africa minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution the guardians fund and released to the children in adulthood therefore testamentary will trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children there are two types of living trusts in south africa namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts in vested trusts the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit asset protectionedit until recently there were tax advantages to living trusts in south africa although most of these advantages have been removed protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage with notable exceptions assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust under the insolvency act act  of  assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for  months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer or  months if heshe is insolvent at the time of transfer after  months creditors have no claim against assets in the trust although they can attempt to attach the loan account thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust through a loan granted to the trust or donating cash to it any natural person can donate r00  per year without attracting donations tax 0 donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year tax considerationsedit under south african law living trusts are considered tax payers two types of tax apply to living trusts namely income tax and capital gains tax cgt a trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 0 individuals pay according to income scales usually less than 0 the trusts income can however be

or settlor transfers settles a property often but not necessarily a sum of money upon the second party the trustee for the benefit of the third party the beneficiary  at least two of the three parties must be different individuals or business entities that is one person can be trustor and trustee and another can be beneficiary or one can be trustor and beneficiary and another be trustee or one person can be trustor and another can be trustee and beneficiary a testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor an inter vivos trust is created during the settlors lifetime by a trust instrument a trust may be revocable or irrevocable in the united states a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable except in california oklahoma and texas in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable an irrevocable trust can be broken revoked only by a judicial proceeding trusts and similar relationships have existed since roman times the trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who isare the equitable owners of the trust property trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners they must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses a court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches hisher fiduciary duty some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law a trustee can be a natural person a business entity or a public body a trust itself is a distinct entity from its trustee and in the united states is subject to federal and state taxation trusts can be incorporated or formed into limited liability companies with the business entity acting as both trustor and trustee

settlor who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries the trust is governed by the terms under which it was created in most jurisdictions this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed it is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties and for multiple individuals to share a single rolecitation needed for example in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiariescitation needed trusts have existed since roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states so statements in this article are generalizations understanding the jurisdictionspecific case law involved is tricky some us states are adapting the uniform trust code to codify and harmonize their trust laws but statespecific variations still remain an owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee separating the propertys legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits this may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent incapacitated or deceased testamentary trusts may be created in wills defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries while the trustee is given legal title to the trust property in accepting the property title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries the primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty the duty of prudence the duty of impartiality a trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior to ensure beneficiaries receive their due trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties including a duties of openness and transparency duties of recordkeeping accounting and disclosure in addition a trustee has a duty to know understand and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties there are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests courts can reverse a trustees actions order profits returned and impose other sanctions if it finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures it is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement history english common lawedit main article history of trusts roman law had a welldeveloped concept of the trust fideicommissum in terms of testamentary trusts created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos living trusts which apply while the creator lives this was created by later common law jurisdictions personal trust law developed in england at the time of the crusades during the th and th centuries in medieval english trust law the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use or cestui que trust at the time land ownership in england was based on the feudal system when a landowner left england to fight in the crusades he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return however crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return unfortunately for the crusader english common law did not recognize his claim as far as the kings courts were concerned the land belonged to the trustee who was under no obligation to return it the crusader had no legal claim the disgruntled crusader would then petition the king who would refer the matter to his lord chancellor the lord chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience at this time the principle of equity was born the lord chancellor would consider it unconscionable that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the crusader the true owner therefore he would find in favor of the returning crusader over time it became known that the lord chancellors court the court of chancery would continually recognize the claim of a returning crusader the legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested the crusader was the beneficiary and the acquaintance the trustee the term use of land was coined and in time developed into what we now know as a trust significanceedit the trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the english legal systemverification needed today trusts play a significant role in most common law systems and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes in curaçao for example the trust was enacted into law on  january 0 however the curaçao civil code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument france has recently added a similar romanlawbased device to its own law with the fiducie amended in 00 the fiducie unlike a trust is a contractual relationship trusts are widely used internationally especially in countries within the english law sphere of influence and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems they do recognise the concept under the hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition partly only the extent that they are parties thereto the hague convention also regulates conflict of trusts although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers they have become very important in american capital markets particularly through pension funds in certain countries essentially always trusts and mutual funds often trusts basic principlesedit property of any sort may be held in a trust the uses of trusts are many and varied for both personal and commercial reasons and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning asset protection and taxes living trusts may be created during a persons life through the drafting of a trust instrument or after death in a will in a relevant sense a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors investors are also the beneficiaries this is particularly evident in the delaware business trust which could theoretically with the language in the governing instrument be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation– although traditionally the massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the us one of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee multiple beneficiaries and their respective creditors particularly the trustees creditors making it bankruptcy remote and leading to its use in pensions mutual funds and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust terminologyedit chart of a trust appointer this is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one this person is usually mentioned in the trust deed appointment in trust law appointment often has its everyday meaning it is common to talk of the appointment of a trustee for example however appointment also has a technical trust law meaning either the act of appointing ie giving an asset from the trust to a beneficiary usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust or the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment the trustees right to do this where it exists is called a power of appointment sometimes a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee such as the settlor the protector or a beneficiary as trustee for atf this is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee beneficiary a beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns in its own capacity iioc this term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf protector a protector may be appointed in an express inter vivos trust as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another the legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate noone doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities if a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees however a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one also protectors are comparatively new while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years it is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties and by others that they do not the case law has not yet established this point settlors this is the person or persons who creates the trust grantors is a common synonym terms of the trust means the settlors wishes expressed in the trust instrument trust deed a trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee beneficiaries settlor and appointer and the terms and conditions of the agreement trust distributions a trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust trustee a person either an individual a corporation or more than one of either who administers a trust a trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trusts beneficiaries creationedit trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor express trusts0 or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts an implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties implied trusts are divided into two categories resulting and constructive a resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent a constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties regardless of their intentions typically a trust can be created in the following ways a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees often referred to as an inter vivos or living trust an oral declaration the will of a decedent usually called a testamentary trust or a court order for example in family proceedings in some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document formalitiesedit generally a trust requires three certainties as determined in knight v knight intention there must be a clear intention to create a trustre adams and the kensington vestry subject matter the property subject to the trust must be clearly identified palmer v simmonds one may not for example state settle the majority of my estate as the precise extent cannot be ascertained trust property may be any form of specific property be it real or personal tangible or intangible it is often for example real estate shares or cash objects the beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified or at least be ascertainable re hains settlement in the case of discretionary trusts where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries mcphail v doulton beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust for example my future grandchildren alternatively the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries trusteesedit a trust may have multiple trustees and these trustees are the legal owners of the trusts property but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties such as a duty of care and a duty to inform if trustees do not adhere to these duties they may be removed through a legal action the trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees a trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument if a trust lacks a trustee a court may appoint a trustee the trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust the trusts affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries filing required tax returns and other duties in some cases dependent upon the trust instrument the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit a trustee may be held personally liable for problems although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased for example a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested in addition a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given however in the united states similar to directors and officers an exculpatory clause may minimize liability although this was previously held to be against public policy this position has changed in the united states the uniform trust code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts although trustees may be unpaid commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about  of assets under management0 beneficiariesedit the beneficiaries are beneficial or equitable owners of the trust property either immediately or eventually the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property or they will receive the property itself the extent of a beneficiarys interest depends on the wording of the trust document one beneficiary may be entitled to income for example interest from a bank account whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twentyfive years the settlor has much discretion when creating the trust subject to some limitations imposed by law the beneficiaries are jocosely known as trust fund babies or trustafarians purposesedit common purposes for trusts include privacy trusts may be created purely for privacy the terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions while the terms of a trust are not spendthrift clauses trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries for example ones children against their own inability to handle money these are especially attractive for spendthrifts courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors but not against creditors of a settlorcitation needed wills and estate planning trusts frequently appear in wills indeed technically the administration of every deceaseds estate is a form of trust conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceaseds spouse if any and then to the children equally if the children are under  or under some other age mentioned in the will  and  are common a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached the executor of the will is usually the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries the trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority charities in some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts in others corporations may be charities also in most jurisdictions charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit in england for example by the charity commission unit trusts the trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle the unit trust pension plans pension plans are typically set up as a trust with the employer as settlor and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries remuneration trusts trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents this form of trust was developed by paul baxendalewalker and has since gained widespread use corporate structures complex business arrangements most often in the finance and insurance sectors sometimes use trusts among various other entities eg corporations in their structure asset protection trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote for example a discretionary trust of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary in such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them and therefore in theory protected from creditors in addition the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name eg the teddy bear trust these strategies are ethically and legally controversial tax planning the tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route if indeed it would be possible to do so in many cases the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance for an example see the nilband discretionary trust explained at inheritance tax united kingdom coownership ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust in particular ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee construction law in canada and minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust in the event of contractor insolvency this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed legal retainer lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolventcitation needed however strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts typesedit alphabetic list of trust typesedit trusts go by many different names depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes a single trust might accurately be described in several ways for example a living trust is often an express trust which is also a revocable trust and might include an incentive trust and so forth community land trust a community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing community gardens civic buildings commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community “clts” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability economic diversity and local access to essential services constructive trust unlike an express trust a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee a constructive trust is imposed by the law as an equitable remedy this generally occurs due to some wrongdoing where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it a constructive trust is essentially a legal fiction for example a court of equity recognizing a plaintiffs request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them the constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization the distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust the latter is an equitable remedy imposed by law being truly remedial the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property discretionary trust in a discretionary trust certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary ie whether there is a class of beneficiaries which a person can be said to belong to in that way persons who satisfy that criterion who are members of that class can enforce the trust re baden’s deed trusts mcphail v doulton directed trust in these types a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trusts execution these participants may include a distribution committee trust protector or investment advisor the directed trustees role is administrative which involves following investment instructions holding legal title to the trust assets providing fiduciary and tax accounting coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants dynasty trust also known as a generationskipping trust a type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantors grandchildren not the grantors children the children of the grantor never take title to the assets this allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first generationskipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantors children however because any income generated by the trusts assets can be made accessible to the grantors children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren express trust an express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust over their assets either now or upon his or her later death in these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument which will either be a will or a trust deed almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type they contrast with resulting and constructive trusts the intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct for an express trust to exist there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property in the usa statute of frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value or is real estate fixed trust in a fixed trust the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor the trustee has little or no discretion common examples are a trust for a minor to x if she attains  a life interest to pay the income to x for her lifetime and a remainder to pay the capital to y after the death of x grantor retained annuity trust grat grat is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers assets as a gift into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument at the end of the term the financial property is transferred taxfree to the named beneficiaries this trust is commonly used in the us to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax hybrid trust a hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts in a hybrid trust the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor but the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property once these fixed amounts have been paid out is to be paid to the beneficiaries implied trust an implied trust as distinct from an express trust is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist a resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for in such a case the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor the creator of the trust in other words the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document improvement trust improvement trusts can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area the trust is often run by a committee and can act similarly to a development agency depending on the provisions of its charter incentive trust a trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary the term incentive trust is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee inter vivos trust or living trust a settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust irrevocable trust in contrast to a revocable trust an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed although in rare cases a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust land trust a private nonprofit organization that as all or part of its mission actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition or by its stewardship of such land or easements or an agreement whereby one party the trustee agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party the beneficiary offshore trust strictly speaking an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident however the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or colloquially as tax havens offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions by extension onshore trust has come to mean any trust resident in a hightax jurisdiction personal injury trust a personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury private and public trusts a private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary by contrast a public trust also called a charitable trust has some charitable end as its beneficiary in order to qualify as a charitable trust the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty providing education carrying out some religious purpose etc the permissible objects are generally set out in legislation but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust by analogy charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation protective trust here the terminology is different between the uk and the usa in the uk a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest they have become comparatively rare in the usa a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning in another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust often a person a wishes to leave property to another person b a however fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before a dies and that therefore b would receive none of it a could establish a trust with b as the beneficiary but then a would not be entitled to use of the property before they died protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation a would establish a trust with both a and b as beneficiaries with the trustee instructed to allow a use of the property until they died and thereafter to allow its use to b the property is then safe from being claimed by as creditors at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment this use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders and is frequently used as an alternative to them purpose trust or more accurately noncharitable purpose trust all charitable trusts are purpose trusts generally the law does not permit noncharitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law and arguable quistclose trusts certain jurisdictions principally offshore jurisdictions have enacted legislation validating noncharitable purpose trusts generally qtip trust short for qualified terminal interest property a trust recognized under the tax laws of the united states which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax resulting trust a resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where  a trust fails wholly or in part as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets or  a voluntary payment is made by a to b in circumstances which do not suggest gifting b becomes the resulting trustee of as payment revocable trust a trust of this kind may be amended altered or revoked by its settlor at any time provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the us as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration

trusts where the trustee has active duties beyond this a simple trust in federal income tax law is one in which under the terms of the trust document all net income must be distributed on an annual basis in the uk a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust bare trusts are commonly used to transfer

originated in england and therefore english trusts law has had a significant influence particularly among common law legal systems such as the united states and the countries of the commonwealth trust law in civil law jurisdictions generally including continental europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions eg curaçao liechtenstein and sint maarten the trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases for example within the brussels regime europe and the parties to the hague trust convention tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that european countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts united statesedit main article united states trust law state law applies to trusts and the uniform trust code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states in addition federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the internal revenue service may affect the structure and creation of trusts the common law of trusts is summarized in the restatements of the law such as the restatement of trusts third 00−0 in the united states the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations partnerships or not at all depending on the circumstances although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations for example the trustpreferred security is a hybrid debt and equity security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks balance sheets the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of large banks regulatory capital0 estate planningedit main article estate planning living trusts as opposed to testamentary will trusts may help a trustor avoid probate avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular probate is potentially costly and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses the expense of trust administration and a lack of certain safeguards the cost of the trust may be  of the estate per year versus the onetime probate cost of  to  for probate which applies whether or not there is a drafted will unlike trusts wills must be signed by two to three witnesses the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the

assets from the us federal estate tax married couples may however effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause for a living trust the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument living trusts also in practical terms tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations if a living trust fails the property will usually be held for the grantorsettlor on resulting trusts which in some notable cases has had catastrophic tax consequencescitation needed south africaedit in many ways trusts in south africa operate similarly to other common law countries although the law of south africa is actually a hybrid of the british common law system and romandutch law in south africa in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ inherited from the romandutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust although this is regarded by modern dutch law as not actually a trust bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantagescitation needed in south africa minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution the guardians fund and released to the children in adulthood therefore testamentary will trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children there are two types of living trusts in south africa namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts in vested trusts the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit asset protectionedit until recently there were tax advantages to living trusts in south africa although most of these advantages have been removed protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage with notable exceptions assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust under the insolvency act act  of  assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for  months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer or  months if heshe is insolvent at the time of transfer after  months creditors have no claim against assets in the trust although they can attempt to attach the loan account thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust through a loan granted to the trust or donating cash to

party the trustee for the benefit of the third party the beneficiary  at least two of the three parties must be different individuals or business entities that is one person can be trustor and trustee and another can be beneficiary or one can be trustor and beneficiary and another be trustee or one person can be trustor and another can be trustee and beneficiary a testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor an inter vivos trust is created during the settlors lifetime by a trust instrument a trust may be revocable or irrevocable in the united states a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable except in california oklahoma and texas in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable an irrevocable trust can be broken revoked only by a judicial proceeding trusts and similar relationships have existed since roman times the trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who isare the equitable owners of the trust property trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners they must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses a court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches hisher fiduciary duty some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law a trustee can be a natural person a

considerations  see also  notes 0 references  further reading overviewedit a trust is created by a settlor who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries the trust is governed by the terms under which it was created in most jurisdictions this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed it is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties and for multiple individuals to share a single rolecitation needed for example in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiariescitation needed trusts have existed since roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states so statements in this article are generalizations understanding the jurisdictionspecific case law involved is tricky some us states are adapting the uniform trust code to codify and harmonize their trust laws but statespecific variations still remain an owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee separating the propertys legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits this may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent incapacitated or deceased testamentary trusts may be created in wills defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries while the trustee is given legal title to the trust property in accepting the property title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries the primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty the duty of prudence the duty of impartiality a trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings in order to enforce their behavior to ensure beneficiaries receive their due trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties including a duties of openness and transparency duties of recordkeeping accounting and disclosure in addition a trustee has a duty to know understand and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law the trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties there are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests courts can reverse a trustees actions order profits returned and impose other sanctions if it finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures it is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement history english common lawedit main article history of trusts roman law had a welldeveloped concept of the trust fideicommissum in terms of testamentary trusts created by wills but never developed the concept of the inter vivos living trusts which apply while the creator lives this was created by later common law jurisdictions personal trust law developed in england at the time of the crusades during the th and th centuries in medieval english trust law the settlor was known as the feoffor to uses while the trustee was known as the feoffee to uses and the beneficiary was known as the cestui que use or cestui que trust at the time land ownership in england was based on the feudal system when a landowner left england to fight in the crusades he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return however crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return unfortunately for the crusader english common law did not recognize his claim as far as the kings courts were concerned the land belonged to the trustee who was under no obligation to return it the crusader had no legal claim the disgruntled crusader would then petition the king who would refer the matter to his lord chancellor the lord chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience at this time the principle of equity was born the lord chancellor would consider it unconscionable that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the crusader the true owner therefore he would find in favor of the returning crusader over time it became known that the lord chancellors court the court of chancery would continually recognize the claim of a returning crusader the legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested the crusader was the beneficiary and the acquaintance the trustee the term use of land was coined and in time developed into what we now know as a trust significanceedit the trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the english legal systemverification needed today trusts play a significant role in most common law systems and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes in curaçao for example the trust was enacted into law on  january 0 however the curaçao civil code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument france has recently added a similar romanlawbased device to its own law with the fiducie amended in 00 the fiducie unlike a trust is a contractual relationship trusts are widely used internationally especially in countries within the english law sphere of influence and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems they do recognise the concept under the hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition partly only the extent that they are parties thereto the hague convention also regulates conflict of trusts although trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers they have become very important in american capital markets particularly through pension funds in certain countries essentially always trusts and mutual funds often trusts basic principlesedit property of any sort may be held in a trust the uses of trusts are many and varied for both personal and commercial reasons and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning asset protection and taxes living trusts may be created during a persons life through the drafting of a trust instrument or after death in a will in a relevant sense a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors investors are also the beneficiaries this is particularly evident in the delaware business trust which could theoretically with the language in the governing instrument be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation– although traditionally the massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the us one of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee multiple beneficiaries and their respective creditors particularly the trustees creditors making it bankruptcy remote and leading to its use in pensions mutual funds and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust terminologyedit chart of a trust appointer this is the person who can appoint a new trustee or remove an existing one this person is usually mentioned in the trust deed appointment in trust law appointment often has its everyday meaning it is common to talk of the appointment of a trustee for example however appointment also has a technical trust law meaning either the act of appointing ie giving an asset from the trust to a beneficiary usually where there is some choice in the matter—such as in a discretionary trust or the name of the document which gives effect to the appointment the trustees right to do this where it exists is called a power of appointment sometimes a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee such as the settlor the protector or a beneficiary as trustee for atf this is the legal term used to imply that an entity is acting as a trustee beneficiary a beneficiary is anyone who receives benefits from any assets the trust owns in its own capacity iioc this term refers to the fact that the trustee is acting on its own behalf protector a protector may be appointed in an express inter vivos trust as a person who has some control over the trustee—usually including a power to dismiss the trustee and appoint another the legal status of a protector is the subject of some debate noone doubts that a trustee has fiduciary responsibilities if a protector also has fiduciary responsibilities then the courts—if asked by beneficiaries—could order him or her to act in the way the court decrees however a protector is unnecessary to the nature of a trust—many trusts can and do operate without one also protectors are comparatively new while the nature of trusts has been established over hundreds of years it is therefore thought by some that protectors have fiduciary duties and by others that they do not the case law has not yet established this point settlors this is the person or persons who creates the trust grantors is a common synonym terms of the trust means the settlors wishes expressed in the trust instrument trust deed a trust deed is a legal document that defines the trust such as the trustee beneficiaries settlor and appointer and the terms and conditions of the agreement trust distributions a trust distribution is any income or asset that is given out to the beneficiaries of the trust trustee a person either an individual a corporation or more than one of either who administers a trust a trustee is considered a fiduciary and owes the highest duty under the law to protect trust assets from unreasonable loss for the trusts beneficiaries creationedit trusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor express trusts0 or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts an implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties implied trusts are divided into two categories resulting and constructive a resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent a constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties regardless of their intentions typically a trust can be created in the following ways a written trust instrument created by the settlor and signed by both the settlor and the trustees often referred to as an inter vivos or living trust an oral declaration the will of a decedent usually called a testamentary trust or a court order for example in family proceedings in some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document formalitiesedit generally a trust requires three certainties as determined in knight v knight intention there must be a clear intention to create a trustre adams and the kensington vestry subject matter the property subject to the trust must be clearly identified palmer v simmonds one may not for example state settle the majority of my estate as the precise extent cannot be ascertained trust property may be any form of specific property be it real or personal tangible or intangible it is often for example real estate shares or cash objects the beneficiaries of the trust must be clearly identified or at least be ascertainable re hains settlement in the case of discretionary trusts where the trustees have power to decide who the beneficiaries will be the settlor must have described a clear class of beneficiaries mcphail v doulton beneficiaries may include people not born at the date of the trust for example my future grandchildren alternatively the object of a trust could be a charitable purpose rather than specific beneficiaries trusteesedit a trust may have multiple trustees and these trustees are the legal owners of the trusts property but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties such as a duty of care and a duty to inform if trustees do not adhere to these duties they may be removed through a legal action the trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees a trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument if a trust lacks a trustee a court may appoint a trustee the trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust the trusts affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries filing required tax returns and other duties in some cases dependent upon the trust instrument the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit a trustee may be held personally liable for problems although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased for example a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested in addition a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given however in the united states similar to directors and officers an exculpatory clause may minimize liability although this was previously held to be against public policy this position has changed in the united states the uniform trust code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts although trustees may be unpaid commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about  of assets under management0 beneficiariesedit the beneficiaries are beneficial or equitable owners of the trust property either immediately or eventually the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property or they will receive the property itself the extent of a beneficiarys interest depends on the wording of the trust document one beneficiary may be entitled to income for example interest from a bank account whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twentyfive years the settlor has much discretion when creating the trust subject to some limitations imposed by law the beneficiaries are jocosely known as trust fund babies or trustafarians purposesedit common purposes for trusts include privacy trusts may be created purely for privacy the terms of a will are public in certain jurisdictions while the terms of a trust are not spendthrift clauses trusts may be used to protect beneficiaries for example ones children against their own inability to handle money these are especially attractive for spendthrifts courts may generally recognize spendthrift clauses against trust beneficiaries and their creditors but not against creditors of a settlorcitation needed wills and estate planning trusts frequently appear in wills indeed technically the administration of every deceaseds estate is a form of trust conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceaseds spouse if any and then to the children equally if the children are under  or under some other age mentioned in the will  and  are common a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached the executor of the will is usually the trustee and the children are the beneficiaries the trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority charities in some common law jurisdictions all charities must take the form of trusts in others corporations may be charities also in most jurisdictions charities are tightly regulated for the public benefit in england for example by the charity commission unit trusts the trust has proved to be such a flexible concept that it has proved capable of working as an investment vehicle the unit trust pension plans pension plans are typically set up as a trust with the employer as settlor and the employees and their dependents as beneficiaries remuneration trusts trusts for the benefit of directors and employees or companies or their families or dependents this form of trust was developed by paul baxendalewalker and has since gained widespread use corporate structures complex business arrangements most often in the finance and insurance sectors sometimes use trusts among various other entities eg corporations in their structure asset protection trusts may allow beneficiaries to protect assets from creditors as the trust may be bankruptcy remote for example a discretionary trust of which the settlor may be the protector and a beneficiary but not the trustee and not the sole beneficiary in such an arrangement the settlor may be in a position to benefit from the trust assets without owning them and therefore in theory protected from creditors in addition the trust may attempt to preserve anonymity with a completely unconnected name eg the teddy bear trust these strategies are ethically and legally controversial tax planning the tax consequences of doing anything using a trust are usually different from the tax consequences of achieving the same effect by another route if indeed it would be possible to do so in many cases the tax consequences of using the trust are better than the alternative and trusts are therefore frequently used for legal tax avoidance for an example see the nilband discretionary trust explained at inheritance tax united kingdom coownership ownership of property by more than one person is facilitated by a trust in particular ownership of a matrimonial home is commonly effected by a trust with both partners as beneficiaries and one or both owning the legal title as trustee construction law in canada and minnesota monies owed by employers to contractors or by contractors to subcontractors on construction projects must by law be held in trust in the event of contractor insolvency this makes it much more likely that subcontractors will be paid for work completed legal retainer lawyers in certain countries often require that a legal retainer be paid upfront and held in trust until such time as the legal work is performed and billed to the client this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolventcitation needed however strict legal ethical codes apply to the use of legal retainer trusts typesedit alphabetic list of trust typesedit trusts go by many different names depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes a single trust might accurately be described in several ways for example a living trust is often an express trust which is also a revocable trust and might include an incentive trust and so forth community land trust a community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that develops and stewards affordable housing community gardens civic buildings commercial spaces and other community assets on behalf of a community “clts” balance the needs of individuals to access land and maintain security of tenure with a community’s need to maintain affordability economic diversity and local access to essential services constructive trust unlike an express trust a constructive trust is not created by an agreement between a settlor and the trustee a constructive trust is imposed by the law as an equitable remedy this generally occurs due to some wrongdoing where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it a constructive trust is essentially a legal fiction for example a court of equity recognizing a plaintiffs request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them to the person who rightfully should have them the constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization the distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust the latter is an equitable remedy imposed by law being truly remedial the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property discretionary trust in a discretionary trust certainty of object is satisfied if it can be said that there is a criterion which a person must satisfy in order to be a beneficiary ie whether there is a class of beneficiaries which a person can be said to belong to in that way persons who satisfy that criterion who are members of that class can enforce the trust re baden’s deed trusts mcphail v doulton directed trust in these types a directed trustee is directed by a number of other trust participants in implementing the trusts execution these participants may include a distribution committee trust protector or investment advisor the directed trustees role is administrative which involves following investment instructions holding legal title to the trust assets providing fiduciary and tax accounting coordinating trust participants and offering dispute resolution among the participants dynasty trust also known as a generationskipping trust a type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantors grandchildren not the grantors children the children of the grantor never take title to the assets this allows the grantor to avoid the estate taxes that would apply if the assets were transferred to his or her children first generationskipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantors children however because any income generated by the trusts assets can be made accessible to the grantors children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren express trust an express trust arises where a settlor deliberately and consciously decides to create a trust over their assets either now or upon his or her later death in these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument which will either be a will or a trust deed almost all trusts dealt with in the trust industry are of this type they contrast with resulting and constructive trusts the intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct for an express trust to exist there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property in the usa statute of frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value or is real estate fixed trust in a fixed trust the entitlement of the beneficiaries is fixed by the settlor the trustee has little or no discretion common examples are a trust for a minor to x if she attains  a life interest to pay the income to x for her lifetime and a remainder to pay the capital to y after the death of x grantor retained annuity trust grat grat is an irrevocable trust whereby a grantor transfers assets as a gift into a trust and receives an annual payment from the trust for a period of time specified in the trust instrument at the end of the term the financial property is transferred taxfree to the named beneficiaries this trust is commonly used in the us to facilitate large financial gifts that are not subject to a gift tax hybrid trust a hybrid trust combines elements of both fixed and discretionary trusts in a hybrid trust the trustee must pay a certain amount of the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by the settlor but the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property once these fixed amounts have been paid out is to be paid to the beneficiaries implied trust an implied trust as distinct from an express trust is created where some of the legal requirements for an express trust are not met but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist a resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for in such a case the law may raise a resulting trust for the benefit of the grantor the creator of the trust in other words the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document improvement trust improvement trusts can be set up by urban or local government to hold funds for the development or improvement of an area the trust is often run by a committee and can act similarly to a development agency depending on the provisions of its charter incentive trust a trust that uses distributions from income or principal as an incentive to encourage or discourage certain behaviors on the part of the beneficiary the term incentive trust is sometimes used to distinguish trusts that provide fixed conditions for access to trust funds from discretionary trusts that leave such decisions up to the trustee inter vivos trust or living trust a settlor who is living at the time the trust is established creates an inter vivos trust irrevocable trust in contrast to a revocable trust an irrevocable trust is one in which the terms of the trust cannot be amended or revised until the terms or purposes of the trust have been completed although in rare cases a court may change the terms of the trust due to unexpected changes in circumstances that make the trust uneconomical or unwieldy to administer under normal circumstances an irrevocable trust may not be changed by the trustee or the beneficiaries of the trust land trust a private nonprofit organization that as all or part of its mission actively works to conserve land by undertaking or assisting in land or conservation easement acquisition or by its stewardship of such land or easements or an agreement whereby one party the trustee agrees to hold ownership of a piece of real property for the benefit of another party the beneficiary offshore trust strictly speaking an offshore trust is a trust which is resident in any jurisdiction other than that in which the settlor is resident however the term is more commonly used to describe a trust in one of the jurisdictions known as offshore financial centers or colloquially as tax havens offshore trusts are usually conceptually similar to onshore trusts in common law countries but usually with legislative modifications to make them more commercially attractive by abolishing or modifying certain common law restrictions by extension onshore trust has come to mean any trust resident in a hightax jurisdiction personal injury trust a personal injury trust is any form of trust where funds are held by trustees for the benefit of a person who has suffered an injury and funded exclusively by funds derived from payments made in consequence of that injury private and public trusts a private trust has one or more particular individuals as its beneficiary by contrast a public trust also called a charitable trust has some charitable end as its beneficiary in order to qualify as a charitable trust the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty providing education carrying out some religious purpose etc the permissible objects are generally set out in legislation but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust by analogy charitable trusts are entitled to special treatment under the law of trusts and also the law of taxation protective trust here the terminology is different between the uk and the usa in the uk a protective trust is a life interest that terminates upon the happening of a specified event such as the bankruptcy of the beneficiary or any attempt by an individual to dispose of his or her interest they have become comparatively rare in the usa a protective trust is a type of trust that was devised for use in estate planning in another jurisdiction this might be thought of as one type of asset protection trust often a person a wishes to leave property to another person b a however fears that the property might be claimed by creditors before a dies and that therefore b would receive none of it a could establish a trust with b as the beneficiary but then a would not be entitled to use of the property before they died protective trusts were developed as a solution to this situation a would establish a trust with both a and b as beneficiaries with the trustee instructed to allow a use of the property until they died and thereafter to allow its use to b the property is then safe from being claimed by as creditors at least so long as the debt was entered into after the trusts establishment this use of trusts is similar to life estates and remainders and is frequently used as an alternative to them purpose trust or more accurately noncharitable purpose trust all charitable trusts are purpose trusts generally the law does not permit noncharitable purpose trusts outside of certain anomalous exceptions which arose under the eighteenth century common law and arguable quistclose trusts certain jurisdictions principally offshore jurisdictions have enacted legislation validating noncharitable purpose trusts generally qtip trust short for qualified terminal interest property a trust recognized under the tax laws of the united states which qualifies for the marital gift exclusion from the estate tax resulting trust a resulting trust is a form of implied trust which occurs where  a trust fails wholly or in part as a result of which the settlor becomes entitled to the assets or  a voluntary payment is made by a to b in circumstances which do not suggest gifting b becomes the resulting trustee of as payment revocable trust a trust of this kind may be amended altered or revoked by its settlor at any time provided the settlor is not mentally incapacitated revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the us as a substitute for a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a persons final affairs after death secret trust a post mortem trust constituted externally from a will but imposing obligations as a trustee on one or more legatees of a will semisecret trust a trust in which a will demonstrates the intention to create a trust names a trustee but does not identify the intended beneficiary simple trust in the us jurisdiction this has two distinct meanings in a simple trust the trustee has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust this is also called a bare trust all other trusts are special trusts where the trustee has active duties beyond this a simple trust in federal income tax law is one in which under the terms of the trust document all net income must be distributed on an annual basis in the uk a bare or simple trust is one where the beneficiary has an immediate and absolute right to both the capital and income held in the trust bare trusts are commonly used to transfer assets to minors trustees hold the assets on trust until the beneficiary is  in england and wales or  in scotland special trust in the us a special trust also called complex trust contrasts with a simple trust see above it does not require the income be paid out within the subject tax year the funds from a complex trust can also be used to donate to a charity or for charitable purposes special power of appointment trust spa trust a trust implementing a special power of appointment to provide asset protection features spendthrift trust it is a trust put into place for the benefit of a person who is unable to control their spending it gives the trustee the power to decide how the trust funds may be spent for the benefit of the beneficiary standby trust or pourover trust the trust is empty at creation during life and the will transfers the property into the trust at death this is a statutory trust statutory business trust a trust created pursuant to a states business trust statute used primarily for commercial purposes two prominent variants of statutory business trusts are delaware statutory trusts and massachusetts business trusts the uniform law commission promulgated a final amended draft of the uniform statutory entity act 00 in 0 as of  january 0 no states have adopted the uniform statutory entity act of 00 testamentary trust or will trust a trust created in an individuals will is called a testamentary trust because a will can become effective only upon death a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of the settlors death unit trust a trust where the beneficiaries called unitholders each possess a certain share called units and can direct the trustee to pay money to them out of the trust property according to the number of units they possess a unit trust is a vehicle for collective investment rather than disposition as the person who gives the property to the trustee is also the beneficiary regional variationsedit trusts originated in england and therefore english trusts law has had a significant influence particularly among common law legal systems such as the united states and the countries of the commonwealth trust law in civil law jurisdictions generally including continental europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions eg curaçao liechtenstein and sint maarten the trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases for example within the brussels regime europe and the parties to the hague trust convention tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that european countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts united statesedit main article united states trust law state law applies to trusts and the uniform trust code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states in addition federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the internal revenue service may affect the structure and creation of trusts the common law of trusts is summarized in the restatements of the law such as the restatement of trusts third 00−0 in the united states the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations partnerships or not at all depending on the circumstances although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations for example the trustpreferred security is a hybrid debt and equity security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks balance sheets the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of large banks regulatory capital0 estate planningedit main article estate planning living trusts as opposed to testamentary will trusts may help a trustor avoid probate avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular probate is potentially costly and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will negative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses the expense of trust administration and a lack of certain safeguards the cost of the trust may be  of the estate per year versus the onetime probate cost of  to  for probate which applies whether or not there is a drafted will unlike trusts wills must be signed by two to three witnesses the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedents assets from mismanagement or embezzlement such as requirements of bonding insurance and itemized accountings of probate assets estate tax effectedit living trusts generally do not shelter assets from the us federal estate tax married couples may however effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause for a living trust the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument living trusts also in practical terms tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations if a living trust fails the property will usually be held for the grantorsettlor on resulting trusts which in some notable cases has had catastrophic tax consequencescitation needed south africaedit in many ways trusts in south africa operate similarly to other common law countries although the law of south africa is actually a hybrid of the british common law system and romandutch law in south africa in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ inherited from the romandutch bewind administered by a bewindhebber in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust although this is regarded by modern dutch law as not actually a trust bewind trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantagescitation needed in south africa minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution the guardians fund and released to the children in adulthood therefore testamentary will trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children there are two types of living trusts in south africa namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts in vested trusts the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit asset protectionedit until recently there were tax advantages to living trusts in south africa although most of these advantages have been removed protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage with notable exceptions assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust under the insolvency act act  of  assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for  months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer or  months if heshe is insolvent at the time of transfer after  months creditors have no claim against assets in the trust although they can attempt to attach the loan account thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust through a loan granted to the trust or donating cash to it any natural person can donate r00  per year without attracting

peachtree road ne suite 0 atlanta ga 0 opinion¶  the plaintiff edward kuykendall filed an action in the circuit court of st clair county against the defendants alleging fraud breach of contract and violations of the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act consumer fraud act  ilcs 0 et seq west 0 arising from the purchase of a commercial property the defendants moved to dismiss the action with prejudice under section a of the code of civil procedure code  ilcs a west 0 and requested attorney fees and costs under a feeshifting provision in the purchase agreement the defendants also sought sanctions under illinois supreme court rule  eff july  0 following a hearing the trial court granted the defendants motions and dismissed the plaintiffs action with prejudice but denied their requests for attorney fees costs and sanctions the plaintiff appealed from the order of dismissal and the defendants crossappealed from the order denying attorney fees and sanctions for reasons that follow we reverse the order of dismissal affirm the order denying sanctions and remand the cause for further proceedings¶  background¶  in june 0 the plaintiff edward kuykendall a california resident entered into an agreement to purchase a commercial building and surrounding property located on east broadway in mt vernon illinois from defendant evelyn j schneidewind revocable trust trust the “commercial building purchase agreement” agreement was executed by both parties as of june  0 in accordance with the agreement the trust provided the plaintiff with an estoppel certificate prepared by the commercial propertys sole tenant dg retail llc dollar general the certificate stated that as of june  0 the trust was not in default of its obligations under the lease the sale closed on july  0¶  in the meantime dollar general sent a certified letter dated july  0 to evelyn j schneidewind as trustee of the trust notifying the trust that some parking bumpers in the parking lot were in poor condition and required repair the certified letter was received by the trust on july  0 one day after the closing over the next two weeks dollar general sent three more certified letters to the trust two dated july  0 and a third dated july  0 notifying the trust that the drainage ditch exterior lighting portions of the buildings roof parking lot and loading zone required maintenance or repairs in each letter dollar general noted that a failure to address the issues within 0 days would constitute a breach of the lease¶  on august  0 dollar general sent the first of four certified letters to the plaintiff notifying him of several maintenance issues including potholes throughout the parking lot problems with exterior lighting in the receiving area broken parking bumpers drainage ditch issues and restriping of the parking lot in a second letter dated september  0 dollar general notified the plaintiff that the exterior guttering was in disrepair the third letter dated september  0 advised that the roof was leaking again the fourth letter dated november  0 indicated that there was a problem with the parking lot repairs¶  the plaintiff and the trust corresponded but they could not agree on which party was responsible for the maintenance issues the plaintiff paid for repairs totaling  and then demanded that the trust reimburse him the plaintiff claimed that the trust had knowledge of the condition of the premises prior to the closing and intentionally concealed the information from the plaintiff the trust refused to reimburse plaintiff the trust asserted that it had no knowledge of the condition of the premises prior to the closing and that under the terms of the agreement the property was sold in an “as is” condition and the plaintiff bore the responsibility to inspect the premises prior to the sale¶  on june  0 the plaintiff initiated this action seeking to recoup the amount he spent on the repairs the second amended complaint at issue here alleges fraud count i breach of contract count ii and violations of the consumer fraud act count iii the crux of the plaintiffs complaint is that the defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of the need for repairs to the commercial building and surrounding property prior to the closing date and that they intentionally concealed this information from the plaintiff despite a duty to disclose it¶  counts i and iii of the second amended complaint are directed against evelyn j schneidewind individually and as trustee of the trust john doe as trustee of the trust david g schneidewind schneidewind insurance agency advantage realty and john does  through  in counts i and iii the plaintiff alleges that the defendants had a duty to disclose defects in the property and any breach of the lease that the defendants intentionally concealed material facts regarding the conditions of the premises and breaches of the lease and that the plaintiff was fraudulently induced to purchase the property the plaintiff asserts that the defendants had a heightened duty to disclose the condition of and defects in the property because evelyn j schneidewind and david g schneidewind held real estate licenses which were sponsored by schneidewind insurance agency and advantage realty the plaintiff further asserts that the trust is liable as the seller and the remaining defendants are liable as trust beneficiaries andor as licensed realtors in counts i and iii the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in the sum of  and punitive damages he seeks as an additional award of attorney fees in count iii¶  count ii of the second amended complaint is directed only against defendant evelyn j schneidewind in her capacity as trustee of the trust in count ii the plaintiff alleges that dollar general issued an estoppel certificate that provided that the trust was in compliance with the terms of the lease that the estoppel certificate was inaccurate as evidenced by dollar generals letters dated july  0 and july  0 that under the terms of the agreement the trust promised to warrant the accuracy of dollar generals estoppel certificate and that the trust breached the agreement in that it refused to pay for repairs when it became evident that the estoppel certificate was inaccurate the plaintiff seeks an award of  due to the trusts breach of its promise to warrant the accuracy of the estoppel certificate and attorney fees and costs under the feeshifting provision in the agreement¶ 0 several documents were attached and incorporated as part of the second amended complaint including the agreement the estoppel certificate the repair receipts and dollar generals certified letters regarding needed repairs at the outset we note that the copy of the agreement that has been appended as an exhibit and referenced by all parties is incomplete two pages are missing apparently inadvertently omitted from the initial copy of the agreement which was filed as part of a defendants motion to dismiss the original complaint neither the plaintiff nor the defendants recognized the omission apparently the parties made copies of the incomplete document and proceeded to attach and incorporate those copies into their respective pleadings¶  according to the opening page of the agreement edward kuykendall and barbara kuykendall are the buyers of the property and evelyn j schneidewind as trustee for the trust is the seller of the property hl commercial real estate is named as the selling broker and trioak consulting group is named as the listing broker¶  section 0 of the agreement sets out the sellers warranties and states in part“seller represents warrants covenants and agrees that as of the date of this agreement the following are and as of closing will be true and correct and further agrees that such representations warranties and covenants shall survive the close of escrowb until the close of escrow seller shall to the extent required under any lease or rental

the seller is obligated by law to reveal all known defects of a material nature of which the seller is aware the parties do not intend by this addendum to waive any provision of the law requiring that the seller or the agents furnish disclosure statements nor do the parties intend to waive any provisions of local laws requiring inspections or reports”¶  section  of the agreement states that the buyer at his expense shall have the right to have the property inspected and then notify the seller of his acceptance or rejection of the property or on what additional conditions the buyer would accept the property¶  section  of the agreement addresses the tenant estoppel certificates and states “prior to the close of escrow seller shall deliver estoppel certificates signed by each tenant who

agrees to immediately notify the buyer of any breach of a lease that occurs after delivery of an estoppel certificate and before the close of escrow the seller warrants that all provisions within the

therein dollar general stated that as of june  0 the landlord was not in default under the lease the plaintiff also attached the certified letters regarding needed repairs which dollar general addressed initially to the trust and subsequently to the plaintiff in these certified letters dollar general notified the landlord that the parking lot the delivery area the roof and gutters and the drainage ditch were in disrepair¶  the receipts for these repairs and correspondence between the parties were also attached to and incorporated in the second amended complaint the repair bills totaled  finally the plaintiff attached correspondence regarding the repair bills in a letter dated november  0 and addressed to david g schneidewind of schneidewind insurance agency and gregory fitzgerald of the trioak consulting group plaintiffs counsel states that the plaintiff is seeking reimbursement of  for repairs to the building and parking lot counsel stated that the sellers and the listing agent had an obligation of full disclosure where the buyer could not personally inspect the property and he requested immediate reimbursement of the sums expended to repair the property subsequently in a letter dated january  0 from the plaintiff to david g schneidewind and trioak consulting group the plaintiff noted that neither schneidewind nor trioak had responded to the letter from plaintiffs counsel the plaintiff further noted that david g schneidewind and trioak had attempted to make repairs of the paving and the broken parking bumpers and that these attempts demonstrated an admission of liability the plaintiff stated that the repairs were not properly performed and that the plaintiff then paid for proper repairs the plaintiff again demanded reimbursement of ¶ 0 the defendants filed their respective combined motions to dismiss the second complaint pursuant to section  of the code  ilcs  west 0 only the motions pursuant to section  are at issue in this appeal defendant evelyn j schneidewind individually and in her capacity as trustee of the trust filed a motion to dismiss under section a evelyn j schneidewind individually asserted that she was neither a party to the real estate contract in question nor a real estate agent or broker in the sale of the property and that these affirmative matters defeated the claims in the plaintiffs second amended complaint evelyn j schneidewind individually and as trustee of the trust asserted that the plaintiffs claims were barred by an affirmative matter in that under the terms of the agreement the commercial property was sold “as is” and that notices of the need for maintenance were sent by dollar general and received by defendant trust after the property was sold to the plaintiff evelyn j schneidewind individually and as trustee of the trust also moved to dismiss count iii under section a on the grounds that the defendants were not engaged in conduct involving trade or commerce as required under the consumer fraud act¶  in support of the motion defendant evelyn j schneidewind relied on the agreement and dollar generals estoppel certificate she also submitted her own affidavit the affidavit of gregory fitzgerald a trustees deed and other documents in support of her motion to dismiss in her affidavit evelyn j schneidewind averred that she was not the legal owner seller or real estate agent or broker of the subject property and that she had never spoken with the plaintiff the affidavit of gregory fitzgerald states that he was the president of trioak consulting group that he was the sole listing broker for the subject property and that he did not split or share a commission with evelyn j schneidewind or any of the other named defendants in the case the trustees deed indicates that the trust conveyed the subject property to the plaintiff on july  0 the deed was filed in the office of the recorder of deeds on july  0¶  defendant evelyn j schneidewind also attached the certified letter dated july  0 from dollar general and a copy of a united states postal service tracking document indicating that the certified letter was delivered to the trust on july  0 evelyn j schneidewind noted that dollar general had purportedly sent the certified letter by email she averred that she did not receive an email from dollar general on july  0 because the email address used by dollar general had not been active since july 00 she attached a notice from her former internet service provider verizon which stated that her email account would be serviced by another provider effective july  00¶  defendant schneidewind insurance agency moved to dismiss the claims against it under section a schneidewind insurance agency asserted that it was not a party to the real estate contract in question that it did not act as a real estate agent or broker regarding the sale of the subject property and that it was not a beneficiary of the trust schneidewind insurance agency argued that the plaintiffs claims were barred by the aforementioned affirmative matters schneidewind insurance agency attached copies of the trustees deed the affidavit by gregory fitzgerald and two affidavits by david g schneidewind in support of its motion to dismiss in an affidavit regarding schneidewind insurance agency david g schneidewind stated that he was the president of schneidewind insurance agency that schneidewind insurance agency was engaged in the sale of auto home and life insurance policies that it has never engaged in the business of real estate sales or brokerage and that it has never held out david g schneidewind as a realtor david g schneidewind further averred that scheidewind insurance agency was neither the owner nor the seller of the subject property in his personal affidavit david g schneidewind averred that he was neither the owner nor the seller of the subject property that he was not the trustee of the trust and that he had never been a real estate agent or broker he further averred that he had never spoken to the plaintiff¶  defendant david g schneidewind also moved to dismiss the claims against him under section a david g schneidewind asserted that he was not a party to the real estate contract in question and that he did not act as a real estate agent or broker regarding the sale of the subject property he attached the trustees deed the affidavit by gregory fitzgerald and his personal affidavit in support of his motion¶  finally advantage realty moved to dismiss the claims against it under section a advantage realty asserted that it was not the broker realtor or agent for any party to the sale of the property in question that it was not a coagent or cobroker and that it was not a beneficiary under the trust defendant advantage realty attached an affidavit by its president and owner david g schneidewind david g schneidewind averred that his company did not act as a real estate agent or broker for the subject property and that it did not share in any of the fees or commissions regarding the sale of that property¶  the defendants motions to dismiss were argued before the trial court on december 0 0 following the arguments the trial court issued an order in which it granted the defendants motions to dismiss pursuant to section a but denied both the request for attorney fees under a “feeshifting” provision in the agreement and the motions for sanctions under illinois supreme court rule  eff july  0 the plaintiff appealed the order of dismissal and the defendants filed a crossappeal challenging the order denying their requests for attorney fees and sanctions¶  discussion¶  before considering the issues raised in the plaintiffs appeal we first address the plaintiffs motion to supplement the record on appeal and alternative motion for sanctions which were taken with the case prior to oral arguments the plaintiff filed a motion to supplement the record on appeal with a page of the agreement that had been left out when a copy of the agreement was filed the plaintiff claims that the omitted page contains a provision which conflicts with the “as is” provision in the agreement and that the agreement cannot be properly construed in the absence of this provision the plaintiff further claims that the defendants initially filed an incomplete copy of the agreement and that the defendants acted in bad faith in persisting to argue that the “as is” provision excused the seller from any responsibility for the repairs once they became aware that the omitted page contained a provision contrary to the “as is” provision the plaintiff seeks leave to supplement the record on appeal to include the omitted page pursuant to illinois supreme court rule  eff jan  00 or alternatively a sanction for the defendants misconduct the defendants filed objections in response to the plaintiffs motion to supplement and alternative motion for sanctions the defendants argue that a party cannot supplement the record on appeal with a document which was not part of the trial courts record the defendants also argue that the plaintiffs motion for sanctions is groundless and should be denied¶  illinois supreme court rule  provides that a record may be supplemented on appeal to supply omissions to correct errors and to settle controversies about whether the record accurately reflects what occurred in the trial court ill s ct r  eff jan  00 under the rule the record may only be supplemented with documents that were actually before the trial court deason v gutzler  ill app d 0   ned    in this case the omitted page of the agreement was not before the trial court and therefore may not be considered on review in addition the plaintiff has not shown that the defendants objection to the motion to supplement was made for an improper purpose accordingly the plaintiffs motion to supplement the record on appeal and alternative motion for sanctions are denied¶ 0 the plaintiffs appeal¶  on appeal the plaintiff challenges the trial courts order granting the defendants motions to dismiss his complaint with prejudice pursuant to section a  ilcs a west 0 the plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in dismissing his action where the defendants failed to show that the plaintiffs claims were barred by an affirmative matter that defeats his claim¶  a motion to dismiss under section a admits the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs complaint but asserts that the claim against the defendant is barred by an affirmative matter that avoids the legal effect of or defeats the claim  ilcs a west 0 sandholm v kuecker 0 il  ¶   ned  an “affirmative matter” is a type of defense that negates a cause of action completely or refutes critical conclusions of law or conclusions of material fact that are unsupported by specific factual allegations contained in or inferred from the complaint smith v waukegan park district  ill d    ned   00 kedzie  0rd currency exchange inc v hodge  ill d    ned    the “affirmative matter” must be apparent on the face of the complaint or supported by affidavits or other evidentiary materials and it must do more than refute a wellpleaded fact in the complaint epstein v chicago board of education  ill d 0   ned 0 0  section a does not authorize the defendant to submit affidavits or evidentiary matters for the purposes of contesting the plaintiffs factual allegations and presenting its version of the facts reynolds v jimmy johns enterprises llc 0 il app th 0 ¶   ned  when a defendant seeks to address the complaints factual allegations a summary judgment motion is the appropriate procedural tool reynolds 0 il app th 0 ¶   ned  the defendant has the initial burden of establishing that an affirmative matter defeats the plaintiffs claim and if satisfied the burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the proffered affirmative matter is either unfounded or requires the resolution of a material fact epstein  ill d at   ned at 0 hodge  ill d at   ned at ¶  when ruling on a motion to dismiss under section a the trial court must accept as true all wellpleaded facts in the plaintiffs complaint and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn and it must construe the pleadings and supporting documents in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party sandholm 0 il  ¶   ned  the motion should be granted only if the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would support his cause of action in re estate of boyar 0 il  ¶   ned 0 a motion to dismiss under section a presents a question of law that is reviewed de novo in re estate of boyar 0 il  ¶   ned 0¶  in this case the defendants argued that the plaintiffs complaint should be dismissed pursuant to section a because the “as is” provision in the agreement constitutes an affirmative matter that bars or otherwise defeats the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint we do not agree initially we note that the defendants argument is based on their interpretations of one provision in the agreement under ordinary principles of contract law a contract must be construed as a whole viewing each provision in light of the others gallagher v lenart  ill d 0   ned   00 the intent of the parties is not to be derived from any clause or provision standing by itself gallagher  ill d at   ned at  thus we will not construe the “as is” provision of the agreement in isolation¶  in reviewing the agreement we note that it contains several provisions which delineate the sellers duties warranties and covenants many of which were set forth earlier in this decision these provisions must be read in conjunction with the “as is” provision for example in section 0 the seller warrants that until the closing it will maintain the property in good condition reasonable wear and tear excepted that each lease affecting the property is in effect and free from default and that to the best of the sellers knowledge all documents that it has delivered to the buyer are complete and accurate section 0 further states that the sellers warranties covenants and representations shall survive the close of escrow section  of the agreement states that even though this is an “as is” sale the seller is obligated by law to reveal all known defects of a material nature of which the seller is aware and that the parties do not intend to waive any provision of the law requiring that the seller or the agents furnish disclosure statements section  states that prior to the close of escrow the seller shall deliver to the buyer an estoppel certificate which is signed by the tenant and which includes substantive facts regarding the lease or rental agreement that the seller agrees to immediately notify the buyer of any breach of a lease that occurs after delivery of an estoppel certificate and before the close of escrow and that the seller warrants that all provisions within the estoppel certificate shall be accurate and that this warranty survives closing contrary to the defendants contention it was not the plaintiffs responsibility to request an updated estoppel certificate prior to the closing section  of the agreement places the burden squarely on the shoulders of the seller to notify the buyer of any breach of the lease that occurs after delivery of an estoppel certificate and before the close of escrow considering the agreement as a whole the “as is” provision is subject to exceptions limitations and potential conflicts when considered with other provisions in the agreement other provisions temper and modify the “as is” provision further the “as is” provision is not an affirmative matter that would preclude the plaintiff from alleging that he acted in reliance upon the accuracy of the various disclosures and the trusts covenant to warranty the estoppel certificate napcor corp v jp morgan chase bank na 0 ill app d   ned  00 thus we find that the “as is” provision does not constitute an affirmative matter that avoids the legal effect of or defeats any of the claims in the plaintiffs second amended complaint¶  next we consider whether the materials submitted by defendants evelyn j schneidewind individually david g schneidewind schneidewind insurance agency and advantage realty constituted an “affirmative matter” under section a so as to defeat plaintiffs allegations of fraud and consumer fraud each of the defendants submitted affidavits stating that these defendants were not owners sellers brokers or realtors of the subject property the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had higher duties to disclose based on their various roles the plaintiff argued that his pleadings allege relationships that may constitute enterprise liability the affidavits do not address these allegations and we must accept as true all wellpleaded allegations and reasonable inferences we note that discovery has not commenced on these issues because the record is not yet fully developed it is difficult to determine whether one or more of the named defendants may have held a special relationship that would have included a duty to disclose defects in the property or breaches of the lease a motion to dismiss pursuant to section a is not a substitute for a summary judgment motion reynolds 0 il app th 0 ¶   ned  in this case the defendants evidentiary materials did not constitute affirmative matters that defeat the plaintiffs claims¶  after reviewing the record we conclude that the trial court erred in granting the defendants motions to dismiss under section a accordingly the order dismissing the second amended complaint with prejudice is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings¶  defendants crossappeal¶  on crossappeal the defendants initially argue that the trial court erred in denying the trusts request for an award of attorney fees and costs under a “feeshifting” provision in the real estate sales contract here we have reversed the trial courts order of dismissal and we remanded the case for further proceedings at this stage of proceedings there is no “prevailing party” therefore we have no occasion to consider arguments regarding the interpretation and application of the “feeshifting” provision in the agreement¶ 0 the defendants also argue that the trial court erred in denying their motions for sanctions pursuant to illinois supreme court rule  under rule  a trial court in its discretion may impose sanctions against a party for filing a pleading that is not well grounded in fact not supported by existing law or by goodfaith argument for modification reversal or extension of the law or instituted for an improper purpose such as harassment ill s ct r a eff july  0 rule  allows but does not require the imposition of sanctions lake environmental inc v arnold 0 il 0 ¶   ned  the decision regarding the imposition of sanctions under rule  is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion dowd  dowd ltd v gleason  ill d 0   ned    in this case the trial court determined that the plaintiffs pleadings were neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose and denied the defendants motions for sanctions after reviewing the record we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendants motion for sanctions¶  finally the defendants asked this court to enter sanctions against the plaintiff under illinois supreme court rule  eff feb   for filing a frivolous appeal under rule b an appropriate sanction may be imposed if an appeal is deemed frivolous or not taken in good faith ill s ct r b eff feb   in this case we do not find that the plaintiffs appeal is frivolous or that it was taken for an improper purpose the defendants motion for sanctions under rule  is denied¶  conclusion¶  for the reasons stated the judgment of the circuit court dismissing the plaintiffs second amended complaint with prejudice is reversed the order denying the defendants motion for sanctions is affirmed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings¶  affirmed in part reversed in part cause remandedjustice cates delivered the judgment of the court with opinion findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic
