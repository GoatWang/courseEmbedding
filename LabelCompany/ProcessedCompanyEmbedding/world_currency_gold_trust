shares which are currently outstanding as of the date of this quarterly report goldman sachs  co jp morgan securities llc merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated and ubs securities llc are the authorized participants an updated list of authorized participants can be obtained from the administrator or the sponsor the investment objective of the fund is to seek to track the performance of the solactive gldr long usd gold index the index less fund expenses the index seeks to track the daily performance of a long position in physical gold as represented by the lbma gold price am and a short position in a basket of nonus currencies ie a long us dollar usd exposure versus the basket fx basket those nonus currencies which are weighted according to the index consist of the following euro japanese yen british pound sterling canadian dollar swedish krona and swiss franc each a reference currency in general the usd value of an investment in shares of the fund is expected to increase when both the price of gold goes up and the value of the usd increases against the value of the reference currencies comprising the fx basket as weighted in the index conversely the usd value of an investment in shares in general is expected to decrease when the price of gold goes down and the value of the usd decreases against the value of the reference currencies comprising the fx basket as weighted in the index if the price of gold increases and the value of the usd decreases against the value of the reference currencies comprising the fx basket or vice versa the net impact of these changes will determine the nav of the fund on a daily basis table of contents investing in the shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks including price volatility the following chart illustrates the movement in the market price of the shares and nav of the shares against the index as well as the corresponding gold price per  of an oz of gold since the day the shares first began trading on the nyse arca share price nav index v gold price from january   to march   image removed logo gold delivery agreement activity the gold delivery agreement is an agreement between the fund and the gold delivery provider pursuant to which gold is delivered to or from the fund to reflect the funds gains and losses with respect to the reference currencies comprising the fx basket the amount of gold bullion transferred under the gold delivery agreement the daily deliverable amount essentially is equivalent to the funds profit or loss as if the fund had exchanged the reference currencies for usds in an amount equal to the funds holdings of gold bullion on such day in general if there is a currency gain ie the value of the usd against the reference currencies comprising the fx basket increases the fund will receive gold bullion in general if there is a currency loss ie the value of the usd against the reference currencies comprising the fx basket decreases the fund will deliver gold bullion in this manner the amount of gold bullion held by the fund will be adjusted to reflect the daily change in the value of reference currencies comprising the fx basket against the usd for more information about the gold delivery agreement see note  from january   the date the shares began trading on the nyse arca to march   the daily deliverable amount gross less the fee paid to the gold delivery provider under the gold delivery agreement ranged from  ounces of gold bullion delivered to  ounces of gold bullion received having corresponding market values respectively of  and  over that same period the fund delivered a net amount of  ounces of gold bullion having a corresponding market value of  table of contents critical accounting policy valuation of gold definition of nav the funds policy is to value the investment in gold bullion at fair value the administrator will value the gold held by the fund on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold as determined by ice benchmark administration limited iba a benchmark administrator which provides an independently administered auction process as well as the overall administration and governance for the lbma gold price the net asset value nav of the fund is the aggregate value of the funds assets including gold delivery agreement less its liabilities in determining the nav of the fund the administrator values the gold held by the fund on the basis of the price of an ounce of gold determined by the iba  am auction process lbma gold price am which is an electronic auction with the imbalance calculated and the price adjusted in rounds  seconds in duration the auction runs twice daily at  am and  pm london time the administrator determines the nav of the fund on each day the nyse arca is open for regular trading generally as of  pm new york time if no lbma gold price am is made on a particular evaluation day or if the lbma gold price pm has not been announced by  pm new york time on a particular evaluation day the next most recent lbma gold price am will be used in the determination of the nav of the fund unless the administrator in consultation with the sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate to use as the basis for such determination once the value of the gold has been determined the administrator subtracts all estimated accrued expenses and other liabilities of the fund from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the fund the resulting figure is the nav of the fund the nav of the fund is used to compute the sponsors fee the administrator determines the nav per share by dividing the nav of the fund by the number of shares outstanding as of the close of trading on nyse arca results of operations the fund commenced operations on january   and in the period from then to march    shares  creation units were created in exchange for  ounces of gold and  ounces of gold were sold to pay expenses at march   the custodian held  ounces of gold on behalf of the fund in its vault  of which is allocated gold in the form of london good delivery gold bars including gold payable if any with a market value of  cost   based on the lbma gold price am on march   through the date of this report i  ounces of gold were receivable by the fund in connection with the settlement of the gold delivery agreement and on march   inspectorate international limited a precious metals auditor concluded the annual random sample count of the funds gold bullion held by the custodian the results can be found on wwwspdrgoldsharescom cash resources and liquidity at march   the fund did not have any cash balances when selling gold to pay expenses the administrator endeavors to sell the smallest amount of gold needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the funds holdings of assets other than gold as a consequence we expect that the fund will not record any net cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period analysis of movements in the price of gold as movements in the price of gold are expected to directly affect the price of the funds shares investors should understand and follow movements in the price of gold investors should be aware that past movements in the gold price are not indicators of future movements table of contents the following chart shows movements in the price of gold

investing involves risk including possible loss of principal because shares of the trust are intended to reflect the price of the gold held by the trust the market price of the shares is subject to fluctuations similar to those affecting gold prices additionally shares of the trust are bought and sold at market price not at net asset value nav brokerage commissions will reduce returns shares of the trust are intended to reflect at any given time the market price of gold owned by the trust at that time less the trusts expenses and liabilities the price received upon the sale of the shares which trade at market price may be more or less than the value of the gold represented by such shares if an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares for a more complete discussion of the risk factors relative to the trust carefully read the prospectus following an investment in shares of the trust several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of gold and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares among them i large sales by the official sector a significant portion of the aggregate world gold holdings is owned by governments central banks and related institutions if one or more of these institutions decides to sell in amounts large enough to cause a decline in world gold prices the price of the shares will be adversely affected ii a significant increase in gold hedging activity by gold producers should there be an increase in the level of hedge activity of gold producing companies it could cause a decline in world gold prices adversely affecting the price of the shares iii a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards gold should the speculative community take a negative view towards gold it could cause a decline in world gold prices negatively impacting the price of the shares

and delays may occur both because of the delay in third parties communicating the information to the site and because of delays inherent in posting information over the internet prices shown are indicative only and do not represent actionable quotations on prices of actual trades the amount of gold represented by shares of the trust will decrease over the life of the trust due to sales of gold necessary to pay the sponsors fee and trust expenses without increases in the price of gold sufficient to compensate for that decrease the price of the shares will also decline and investors will lose money on their investment the trust will have limited duration the liquidation of the trust may occur at a time when the disposition of the trusts gold will result in losses to investors although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the nav and the trading price of trust shares through arbitrage opportunities there is no guarantee that they will do so there is no guarantee an active trading market will develop for the shares which may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares the value of the shares of the trust will be adversely affected if gold owned by the trust is lost or damaged in circumstances in which the trust is not in a position to recover the corresponding loss the trust is a passive investment vehicle this means that the value of your shares may be adversely affected by trust losses that if the trust had been actively managed might have been avoidable shares of the trust are not deposits or other
