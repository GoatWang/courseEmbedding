industry is gearing up for the biggest fight of his career preserving his wall street legacy as regulators accuse him and his multibilliondollar firm of insider tradingthe stakes are high too for the securities and exchange commission which on wednesday sued mr cooperman a yearold billionaire accusing his firm omega advisors of reaping  million in illegal profit by using nonpublic information about an energy deal in  the case is the most prominent to be brought by the agency since a court ruling that narrowed the definition of insider tradinghours after the civil complaint was filed mr cooperman fired back with a detailed fivepage rebuttal sent to investors he followed with a defiant conference call opening with an offcolor joke about an yearold man bragging about having sex with an yearold woman he told investors on the call that he had refused to settle and that he would fight the sec in courtthe stage is set for what is expected to be a noholdsbarred legal battle between a gruff outspoken investor and an agency that has come under criticism for not taking more cases to trial advertisement continue reading the main story mr cooperman the son of a south bronx plumber is

continue reading the main story “it took me  years of hard work and playing by the rules to get where i got i’m not going to let these people destroy my legacy” mr cooperman told investors on wednesdayregulators contend that mr cooperman used his position as one of the biggest shareholders in atlas pipeline partners to gain confidential information from an unidentified executive at the company about the sale of one of its gasprocessing facilities to another energy company in july mr cooperman had assured the executive that he would not trade on the information but regulators said that despite making that promise he had his firm accumulate a bigger position and profited when atlas’s stock jumped  percent after the sale was announcedthe case also involves some family drama mr cooperman’s timely trades indirectly benefited a grandson whose account mr cooperman managed regulators said the money manager bought an atlas pipeline bond that rose in value after the dealand in another twist mr cooperman’s son wayne who runs another hedge fund may get drawn into the fray because of his own trading in the same stockin his letter mr cooperman said his son was prepared to testify on his behalf noting that his son’s fund cobalt capital management was betting against shares of atlas pipeline at the time and he is one of the biggest investors in his son’s firmmr cooperman said he did not share any information about the sale of the gasprocessing facility with his son advertisement continue reading the main story in the complaint however the sec quoted an email that mr cooperman sent to an unidentified relative — described as the manager of another hedge fund — informing him of the yetunannounced  million deal this same relative may have been the first to have sounded the alarm about unusual trading in shares and options of atlas pipeline the day the deal was announced according to the sec document insider trading charges against cooperman the sec charged hedge fund manager leon g cooperman and his firm omega advisors with insider trading open document in a separate email the relative writes to an executive at atlas pipeline calling the options trading before the sale announcement “fishy” and “shady” the relative goes on to say that “somebody should investigate” and then asks “how do i become a whistleblower”mr cooperman’s son did not return a phone call seeking comment but his firm did buy shares in atlas pipeline later in  according to regulatory filings wayne cooperman has not been charged with any wrongdoingregulators also contended that mr cooperman tried to conceal his actions after omega received a subpoena relating to the atlas trades some  months later by contacting one of atlas’s executives in an attempt to “fabricate” a cover

or contact us anytime mr cooperman “allegedly undermined the public confidence in the securities markets and took advantage of other investors who did not have this information” andrew j ceresney the sec’s chief of enforcement said in a statementthe civil case against mr cooperman filed in the federal district court in philadelphia would appear to sidestep a monkey wrench thrown into some insider trading prosecutions by a recent appellate court decision that ruling made it more difficult to charge someone with insider trading if the person improperly leaking confidential information was not getting a personal benefit of some consequencethe personal benefit issue would not seem to arise in this matter because regulators contend that mr cooperman “misappropriated” the confidential information about the impending sale from the unidentified executive at atlas pipelineted wells and daniel kramer his lawyers at paul weiss rifkind wharton  garrison issued a statement in which they called the allegations “entirely baseless”mr cooperman said he was being charged with trading on paper gains and added that his firm never sold shares after the deal was announced he said much of the firm’s trading was related to shortterm positions in a stock that the firm had been bullish on for many years advertisement continue reading the main story in some insider trading cases hedge fund managers have been forced to shut their firms and return money to investors on wednesday mr cooperman emphasized that  percent of omega advisors’  billion in assets under management belonged to members of the firm and that business would continue as usual he added however that if the firm concluded that the sec case had “become too much of a distraction” it would voluntarily give back moneyomega is the second large hedge fund to be rocked by an insider trading investigation this yearin june securities regulators and federal prosecutors charged a top manager at visium asset management with insider trading the manager sanjay valvani committed suicide a week later visium’s founder jacob gottlieb whom the authorities did not charge is in the process of shuttering the hedge fund after selling some of its funds to alliancebernsteinthe two cases show that insider trading remains an issue in the nearly  trillion hedge fund industry even after a sweeping crackdown by federal prosecutors in manhattan that push led to convictions and guilty pleas from more than  people including raj rajaratnam the billionaire cofounder of the galleon group another firm sac capital advisors a onetime  billion hedge fund pleaded guilty to insider trading and paid  billion in fines to federal authoritiesin the civil complaint on wednesday the sec also accused mr cooperman of failing to report in a timely manner information about his hedge fund’s holdings and other transactions in publicly traded companies in violation of federal securities laws more than  timesregulators said mr cooperman “repeatedly violated” federal securities laws requiring investors to disclose when their equity interest in a publicly traded company rises above either a  or  percent stakespeaking at a private charity event in june at the metropolitan club in manhattan mr cooperman addressed the looming investigation telling the wall street audience “i call companies that’s what i do for a living”he said “every time i speak with a company i say the same thing don’t disenfranchise me if i ask you a question don’t answer a question if you’re not prepared to give anyone else that information just
