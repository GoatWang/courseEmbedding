unprecedented gift for undergraduate financial aid  kenneth c griffin photograph by paul elledge kenneth c griffin ’ founder and chief executive officer of the citadel llc a multibilliondollar chicagobased hedgefund and financialservices enterprise has given harvard  million principally for undergraduate financial aid the university announced today“ken griffin’s extraordinary philanthropy is opening harvard’s gates wider to the most talented students in the world no matter their economic circumstances” said harvard president drew gilpin faust in acknowledging the gift the largest in harvard college history griffin himself called itextremely important that students of all backgrounds have the opportunity to challenge themselves learn to solve complex problems and ultimately better our world my goal with this gift is to help ensure that harvard’s needblind admission policy continues and that our nation’s best and brightest have continued access to this outstanding institutionspecifically the giftestablishes  griffin scholarships  such financialaid endowment scholarships are now available for donations of  each that minimum is to rise to  in the fiscal year beginning july  andprovides matching funds through the new griffin leadership challenge fund for financial aid for  new scholarships to encourage other donors to make commitments to the college’s financialaid programdepending on the matching formula and timing of gifts the griffin scholarships other donors’ gifts when received and the matching funds provided by griffin could collectively generate a significant portion of the faculty of arts and sciences’ fas million capitalcampaign goal for undergraduate aid the only equivalently large fas priority is its million facultyrelated target for endowed chairs graduatestudent fellowships research support and related purposes in acknowledgment the college financialaid office will be renamed the griffin financial aid office led by the griffin director of financial aidgriffin’s gift also includes  million to establish the griffin professorship of business administration at harvard business school from which his wife anne dias griffin who runs a separate hedge fund earned her mba in  the new professorship said president faust “reflects our shared belief in the importance of attracting both worldclass students and unparalleled faculty in each of our schools”the undergraduate financialaid contextfas dean michael d smith declared himself “absolutely bowled over by the generosity of ken griffin and his leadership to provide a truly transformational gift” for the top college priority in the capital campaign during an interview last autumn before the campaign launch he said the aid budget had “never been put on the table” in the aftermath of the  financial crisis—even as the faculty’s assets decreased by  billion and family need rose during the ensuing recession but as he said in a recent interview concerning griffin’s gift he has worried continuously about “truly making our program sustainable” even at its current scale in the statement announcing the gift smith declared that griffin’s philanthropic leadership “has set financial aid…on a lasting foundation” and his gift “will impact the lives of students and their families now and for generations to come”three intersecting factors explain why that is soenhanced aid this is the tenth anniversary of the harvard financial aid initiative hfai announced in february  by thenpresident lawrence h summers the beginning of a liberalized aid program progressively expanded in subsequent years the initiative eliminated parental contributions to the cost of educating a student enrolled in the college for families with incomes below  and lowered the cost for families with incomes up to  the zerocontribution threshold was raised to  in  with the costreduced tier raised to  in late  president drew faust upped the ante byeliminating loans so students could graduate debtfree enabling them to make lessconstrained career choicescutting the parental contribution for families with incomes from  to  by limiting their cost for a child’s year at harvard to an amount that scales up from zero to  percent of incomelimiting the cost to  percent of income for families with incomes from  to  andeliminating home equity and retirement savings in calculating aidin retrospect the timing of that considerable enrichment of aid was fateful it came during a period of strong returns on the endowment its value peaked at  billion as of june  —only to be succeeded  months later by the financialmarket collapse the resulting billion decline in the endowment and ensuing budget cuts as of the fall of  effective for the class of  the zerocontribution threshold was raised to  of family income and the zerotopercent slidingscale formula was restructured reducing the upper tier of eligible families to those with incomes of  or less as fas’s spokesman explained at the time “these adjustments help to meet heightened demand for aid precipitated by ongoing challenges in the united states and the global economies demand for aid is most acute at the lower end of the economic spectrum and harvard modified its policy and expanded its investment to respond to this need” on those terms the university recently reported that more than onequarter of the college class of  a record number are hfai beneficiaries among freshmen enrolling last fall  are from families who pay no parental contribution and  from families paying a reduced parental contributionrising need under the liberalized financialaid formulas the number of students qualifying for aid and the size of their grants rose the recession put many more families’ incomes under great pressure and of course the annual bill for tuition room and board increased annually—enlarging the size of the required aid package for students entering the college in the fall of  when hfai began the term bill was  this academic year it is —a compound annual growth rate of about  percentthe resource squeeze according to college data harvard’s budget for undergraduate financial aid has increased by  percent since  and today  percent of undergraduates receive financial aid given the increase in spending and the decrease in the value of the endowment and two years of resulting reduced distributions for operating expenses the faculty’s principal source of revenue fas found itself in a financially uncomfortable position as it had to fund the aid budget—never “put on the table” in smith’s words—by drawing more on its unrestricted fundsin fiscal year  in fact despite higher term bills total net tuition and fees after financialaid disbursements declined since tuition and fees typically represent half or more of all fas’s unrestricted funds for the college the graduate school and the faculty that obviously limited smith’s ability to meet other costs at a time of acute financial pressure and to invest in academic innovations new professors’ research and so on net tuition and fees resumed growing in the two subsequent years“a lot of our unrestricted money is going to” undergraduate financial aid smith said “i cant think of better programs for the money to go to than that” given the benefit to students themselves—and to their classmates and the college as a whole from having highly qualified and more economically diverse undergraduate body but in annual budgeting he said the problem of funding the aid program and of its future inevitably has arisen “we’ve struggled to make that budget every year” he said “that’s why it’s been such a high campaign priority for us”according to fas approximately  percent of undergraduate financial aid is currently paid for by distributions from endowments earmarked for that purpose hence the priority given to college aid funds in the current campaign additional financialaid endowment totaling  million would generate  million or more of spendable funds annually in effect releasing an equivalent sum of unrestricted monies and of course the endowed corpus would be expected to appreciate over time helping to defray any increased aid coststhus the facultywide significance of griffin’s scholarship gift and challenge fundto commemorate hfai’s tenth anniversary—and perhaps in anticipation of this signal gift announcement—on february  the harvard gazette published this story on financial aid and some of its student beneficiariesthe giftby itself griffin’s gift to the college may in fact be the largest single gift in harvard history period it exceeds the two individual gifts of  million from hansjörg wyss mba ’ announced in  and  to support bioengineering research and the million gift made in  by david rockefeller ’ g ’ lld ’ in support of undergraduate international experiences and the renovation of the harvard art museumsmith described griffin as an “active” supporter of fas and the college especially for scholarships beginning in his tenthreunion year when he established a scholarship to honor his grandfather wayne r gratz he has been a participant in the alumni financialaid committee and “he’s been part of this conversation for a long time” smith said he and griffin had discussed the need for supporting aid throughout his deanship exploring ways to “create a foundation for this program”as their conversations focused on the scale and structure of the gift smith said griffin has “just been fantastic as a partner in this i can’t thank him enough for setting an example i hope others will follow not only for harvard but for other institutions”griffin said that his gift comes from the belief that financial aid is a “key part” of making harvard “available and open to all” in a brief interview with harvard magazine he recalled becoming directly involved with financialaid concerns about  years ago being “in the middle of that discussion to understand what are the issues that students face in trying to go to harvard what are the issues that families face in trying to put their children through harvard“growing up my parents were always very clear that they were fully committed to supporting me in going to school wherever i wanted i don’t think they envisioned my going to harvard and the price tag that would go with that…i was not on financial aid but i can assure you that for my parents and for myself the financial support of my grandmother was really important not everybody has that in life”the donoramong the thousands of hedgefund managers a tiny cohort are particularly successful able to generate large returns for their investors and on their own invested assets for a sustained period in some outstanding years topping industry and popular lists with ninefigure earnings and appreciation in their personal portfolios if they can sustain the performance they find their way onto the forbes and other lists of the wealthyin these rarefied circles kenneth griffin and citadel stand outfirst he has been at this work at the firm he founded for virtually his entire career rather than coming to it after an extended tour on wall street or at another firm he began trading as an undergraduate as the new york times bloomberg and institutional investor in a december  profile have all reported a year after graduating from the college a year early in  with an economics concentration he launched citadel with  million under management over time propelled by a decade of  percent returns in its flagship funds citadel reportedly grew to manage more than  billion at its peak before the  financial crisissecond to an unusual degree griffin has apparently combined opportunistic instinctive investing with highly quantitative automated algorithmdriven techniques among citadel’s opportunistic contrarian moves the bloomberg and institutional investor accounts list the firm’s decisions to begin a kind of trading and investing that others abandoned in the wake of the collapse of longterm capital management in  to enter energy trading after enron’s bankruptcy in late  and to make big bets on natural gas after another hedge fund lost billions in third citadel has invested heavily in proprietary technology for its own investing strategies and trading operations according to most accounts and has regularly sought to find ways to bring functions inhouse that other investors perform through wall street firms—and even to sell these services to other asset managers as institutional investor reported most notably in the wake of the financial crisis in  griffin set about trying to build a fullsize fullservice investment bank to fill the gap left by the collapse of lehman brothers and the absorption by other firms of bear stearns and merrill lynch that effort was largely abandoned in  and other ventures have come and gone as well nonetheless citadel securities’ retailexecution services by its own account carry out nearly a quarter of retail investors’ us listedstock trades it trades for institutional investors as well and is a large participant in automated highspeed trading generally the citadel technology operation similarly serves other investmentmanagement clientsfourth griffin and citadel have survived a financial neardeath experience when the financial crisis intensified in october  citadel’s funds were by most accounts both heavily invested in severely affected market sectors and very heavily leveraged on october  wall street was riveted the new york times liveblogged the event as citadel’s chief operating officer gerald beeson and griffin conducted a conference call to stave off rumors that the firm was imperiled in fact its two principal funds were then down  percent and ended the year with losses of  percent the new york times reported after limiting investors’ redemptions and improving performance the firm’s diversified stable of investment funds and other businesses were again producing very strong results with the flagship hedge funds realizing returns from as much as  percent in  to between  percent and  percent in subsequent years by early  citadel had restored the funds’ value sufficiently that it could again collect its substantial contractual management feesin their personal lives the griffins have become notably active in two realms as art collectors reportedly assembling masterpieces ranging from works by edgar degas to jasper johns and as philanthropists active particularly in their home city chicago among other engagements kenneth griffin serves on the

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
