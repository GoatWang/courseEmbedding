couldn’t agree more with what you like about shyft – we do have the best people and the best products youour unique culture and great benefits learning and fun are all part of the recipe along with our core values you’re correct that our staff turnover is slightly higher than in years past there are two main reasons  we’re a highperformance culture and not everyone makes the grade and  the pace we’re setting with our growth is not for everyone that said our turnover is below industry average and we try and strike the right worklife balance and we attract the best people because we’re working on hard problems that improve patients lives with a smart and diverse team with a focus on culture​ i agree that learning is important and the reason we have almost  internal and online learning modules on our newly implemented training platform if you include our lunch and learn series our woman in tech program and our management series i’d hope you’d agree that learning is a key ingredient to our culture and yes we do invest in recent grads from great programs but our average age is still over  we can agree to disagree on transparency we work hard to share company information with our entire team at our monthly allhands meetings including the popular “ask us anything” session where we field  of your direct questions communication and transparency are core to our culture and why we’re a glassdoor opencompany which recognizes and reward companies that embrace transparency in the workplace thanks again for your feedback and i wish you a successful and rewarding time at shyft

inappropriatehelpful  shyft analytics response apr   – vp customer success thanks for sharing your candid feedback and concerns we agree that there’s a need for an alternate growth path in customer success that isn’t dependent on project andor people management asand change the different roles that are needed and the opportunities within those organizations evolve too during our last review cycle as we looked at our team and our career matrix it became clear that having a single path to career growth in customer success wasn’t going to work for a number of the talented members of our team and would eventually drive them to seek that growth somewhere else the head of our customer success tech team and i have been working with our talent team to define a parallel path for subject matter experts –people who want to achieve career growth but don’t want to grow into management roles instead they want to deepen their knowledge of technical areas commercialclinical analytics and clinical data – and there’s a need for this too as we strengthen our customer relationships it’s taken some time to define the roles and the initial path for growth but we’ve had conversations with some folks who want to move in this direction to help inform this process so as promised in our last cs all hands meeting the new career matrix with the definition of these additional pathways to growth is scheduled to be released and posted to our internal talent management system by the end of april it’s important that we continue to evaluate the career matrix on a periodic basis since organizations aren’t static – as products and offerings evolve our customer relationships evolve and our company matures we expect the opportunities for our teams to evolve right along with it

great individual contributors who were promoted without guidance the managers that are great really make a difference the organization is focusing on developing training for managers and across the board for all employeesthe company really does care about their culture and has plenty of fun events that staff are encouraged to attendif youre young this is a great place for initial career development as long as you can demonstrate that youre ready for the next levelconslack of clear expectations of managers makes experiences of direct reports vary by team and project some managers may lack leadership and project management skills required to enable efficient and successful teams furthermore it seems that some managers create a toxic environment for their team at times this isnt an issue thats specific to shyft but it would be great if we could get ahead of itlong hours depending on project can reach very rough levelsadditionally the organization is currently trying to make significant and important changes however a lack of standardized processes and clear planning on how to implement the changes are causing frustrating growing pains hopefully we will get past them in advice to managementpromote employees who are both great individual contributors and have some leadership skills to management positions creating a management training program is a great first step

have been and continue to be a focus for us as we continue to grow and evolve shyft most of our managers have grown up in ourreally understand our products customers and industry  there’s a lot of benefits to internal promotions but you’re right that it means that we need to provide training and help new managers prepare as they move into new roles  in december we piloted a new manager training program and all managers and those poised to be managers will be going through it this year  and we continue to work with our partners on our talent team to evolve all training but especially for our managers to give them more tools and approaches as they manage teams with different levels of experience    over the past two years we have actively evolved from a technologyenabled services company to a servicesenabled product company  the transition isn’t easy and it doesn’t happen overnight especially not with some legacy customers who frankly did have more bespoke solutions but we’re actively moving them to our upgraded products and standard solutions  however as a company with an evolving product platform there are areas where we leverage customer requests to innovate our products  during  and into  our product roadmap has moved the needle significantly driving more automation standardization and allowing our teams to drive value in our customer relationships especially as our team members mature       on an annual basis our talent team collects real market salary data to ensure our salary bands remain competitive in the markets where we are hiring our goal is to construct compensation and total reward packages base salary bonus and stock options that align with the individuals experience level difficulty of role as well as general market demand for the skillset this is something that we will continue to monitor and adjust as needed    thanks again for the honest feedback  i welcome open dialogue  its an important part of the culture and company we are building
