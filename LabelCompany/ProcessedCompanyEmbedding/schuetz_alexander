pediatricsautumn n ratedthe drs in the office are very nice most of the nursing staff is also very nice and professional but the front office staff and the billing dept are extremely rude and unprofessional i had an issue with having  insurance companies my ex husband and i both carry inaurance on our child i was unaware that the st inaurance company sent out a letter for verification to my sons father therefore denying the claims i didnt find out until the next time i tried to make an appt for our son and was told that i would have to pay out of pocket for the visit and pay off the remaining balance in full before i could apply our insurance when asked how to fix it i was told to call my ex huabands insurance company and then i was refused the information needed to be able to call i had to ask several times for just a phone number and then was very rudely told i dont know why you are calling they wont speak to you since you are not the policy holder i called anyway and got the infomation i needed called back and told them the one claim was being resubmitted and that the office needed to turn the other claim in because they never recieved it i was told they wouldnt do it because it was past the time frame for them i was then told to call the insurance company back and tell them the dob was wrong she treated me like i was a crappy parent for letting it come to this and why i dont just make his father fix it i was fed up with the ladys presumptuous attitude and told her if they wanted their money to call the insurance company and straighten it out she also proceeded to talk over me and raise her voice telling me to quit pointing fingers at their office and had i taken care of this a while ago i wouldnt be in this mess i told her i wasnt pointing fingers at her and that i was never notified of the issue his father was she told me to put the blame on him i said you know what you have no right to tell me what i need to do or should do its not my fault the papaerwork was not sent to me nor was it my fault the wrong dob was entered i then promptly asked how to transfer my childs care to another dr because i refuse to come to a place that was so

in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a
