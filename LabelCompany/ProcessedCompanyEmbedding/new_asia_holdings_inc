asia holdings inc formerly known as dm products inc previously known as midwest eswt corp and previously known as effective sport nutrition corporation the company or nahd was incorporated on march   prior to december  we were in the business of locating inventive products and introducing these products such as the banjo minnow fishing lure system through a direct response model a form of marketing that allows potential consumers direct access to the seller without the necessity of traditional retail in december  the company underwent a change in control as a result of approximately  of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the company being acquired by new asia holdings inc wholly owned by lin kok peng phd and management adopting a new business plan based on developing highly advanced proprietary neural trading models for the financial community it is our belief that our stateoftheart trainable algorithms in our models will emulate aspects of the human brain providing our algorithms with a selftraining ability to formalize unclassified information and thus develop an enhanced ability to make forecasts based on the historical information and other data available at their disposal our neural networks will not make forecasts instead they will analyze price data and uncover opportunities using our proprietary neural network trade decisions will be made based on thoroughly analyzed data which is not generally possible when using traditional technical analysis methods we anticipate offering a series of nextgeneration tools that can detect subtle nonlinear interdependencies and patterns that other methods of technical analysis are unable to uncover we will offer trading software solutions to clients on the basis of a software as a service saas licensing and delivery models with licensed users availing themselves of servicebased contractual arrangements in addition we will utilize our inhouse proprietary neural trading models to trade our own funds thus providing added value to our shareholders our proprietary trading models will be developed by a team of professional engineers in communications electronic circuitry design and

as the market moveschanges and upon development our systems will bring a proven rigorously tested trackrecord we anticipate that our proprietary algorithmic trading systems will generate superior risk adjustable returns for our clients the companys focus is to capitalize the volatility of the  hours forex markets to achieve capital appreciation over a medium to long term combined with the usage of a good wealth vehicle in order to control risk profit from both bull or bear markets maximize liquidity and economic resilience recession proof the nahd systems have been designed to constantly adapt themselves and to take intelligent positions as the market moveschanges the models are subjected to rigorous testing akin to the volatile trading environment of major financial eventscrisis that happened in recent history these models are also programmed to have the ability to learn and adapt new manners of trading effectively translating the human behavioral of trading into a predictive science the nahd cutting edge quantitative strategies and proprietary algorithmic trading system are developed to generate superior risk adjustable returns for the holders on august   the company

the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year  these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december    in preparing these financial statements management is required to make estimates

deficit of  not including the contingent liability of  and is in need of additional capital to grow its operations so that it can become profitable these matters among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern    in view of these matters the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon growth of revenues and the ability of the company to raise additional capital management believes that the deployment of its proprietary trainable trading algorithms in  coupled with several successful transactions that have been completed by its licensee new asia momentum ltd naml to increase the assets under management “aum” as reported in the company’s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   will result in increased
