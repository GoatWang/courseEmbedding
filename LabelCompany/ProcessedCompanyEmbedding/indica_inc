halo stay one step ahead with halo image analysis   optimizing algorithms annotating digital slides and computetime can lengthen timetoresults halo™ addresses these shortfalls to help your lab achieve quality analysis in the shortest time possible   shorten the learning curve spend less time learning software and more time analyzing data halo’s analysis tuning is fast and easy for experts and novices alike without sacrificing data quality no need to ‘build’ analysis algorithms from scratch halo’s flexible purposebuilt modules provide quick quantitative results in oncology neuroscience metabolism toxicological pathology and more   rapidly annotate slides do you dread annotating digital slides using your current system cut annotation time in half with halo’s intuitive flexible annotation tools draw freehand or use the magnet pen tool to automatically ‘snap’ annotations to your tissues easily redraw amend move rotate or copypaste existing annotations better still teach the classifier module to automatically select tissues of interest for analysis across all images in a study   turbocharge analysis speed digital slides are large and bog down conventional analysis systems halo’s parallel processing technology and optimized algorithms yield up to  times the analysis rate of competitive solutions using the same standard hardware organizations with greater throughput demands can couple halo with hypercluster™ combined hardware and software technology to reach speeds up to  times faster than competitor solutions     easily explore cellular data halo reports morphological and multiplexed expression data on a cellbycell basis across entire tissue sections and maintains an interactive link between cell data and cell image click on any cell in the image and immediately see analysis outputs for that specific cell sorting and filtering capabilities allow the user to mine millions of cells while visually assessing corresponding cell populations for example sort cells according to biomarker intensity and immediately locate cells with highest intensity in the image just imagine the endless possibilities   grow with halo modules a modular platform that can expand with your needs start with a few modules and add more as your needs change use halo on a single workstation or ramp up to a server based license for your entire group halo is flexible enough
