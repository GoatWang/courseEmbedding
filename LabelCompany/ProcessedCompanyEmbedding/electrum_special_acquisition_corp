gross proceeds from the offering which is payable upon the closing of our initial business combination plus if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised an additional amount equal to  of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option and will be paid from the funds held in the trust account  the amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at  even if the overallotment is exercised in addition interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to pay income or other tax obligations we estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  over a month period assuming an interest rate of approximately  per year  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would be deducted from our excess working capital our sponsor and an entity controlled by mr anderson one of our director nominees and their designees have committed to purchase the private warrants for an aggregate purchase price of  from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering each private warrant entitles the holder to purchase onehalf of one ordinary share at  per half share all of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full will be placed in an account in the united states at jp morgan chase bank na maintained by continental stock transfer  trust company as trustee the funds held in the trust account will be invested only in united states government treasury bills notes or bonds having a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under rule a promulgated under the investment company act of  and that invest solely in us treasuries so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of  of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period the proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business the payment to teg an affiliate of our sponsor of a monthly fee of  is for general and administrative services including office space utilities and secretarial support this arrangement is being agreed to by teg for our benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors with compensation in lieu of a salary we believe based on rents and fees for similar services in new york new york that the fee charged by teg is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person this arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public shareholders other than the  per month fee no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination regardless of the type of transaction that it is however such individuals will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations since the role of present management after our initial business combination is uncertain we have no ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to those persons after our initial business combination regardless of whether the overallotment option is exercised in full the net proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be approximately  in addition interest earned on the funds held in the trust account may be released to us to to pay income or other tax obligations the allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds in the event that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate we may reallocate some of such proceeds within the above described categories if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so or the amount of interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the current low interest rate environment we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us we will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering including the funds held in the trust account to acquire a target business and to pay our expenses relating thereto to the extent that our shares are used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will along with any other net proceeds not expended be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’s operations for development and construction of one or more mining assets for strategic acquisitions and for marketing research and development of existing or new products to the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination we will pay the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account if such funds are insufficient esof has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation currently anticipated to be no more than  and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses as of april   an affiliate of our sponsor loaned to us an aggregate of  to be used for entity formation costs the loan is payable without interest on the earlier of i june   ii the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or iii the date on which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering the loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses we believe that upon consummation of this offering we will have sufficient available funds to operate for up to the next  months assuming that our initial business combination is not consummated during that time however if necessary in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering our sponsor officers and directors or their affiliates may but are not obligated to loan us funds from time to time or at any time in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion each loan would be evidenced by a noninterest bearing promissory note the notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination without interest or at the lender’s discretion up to  of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private warrants at a price of  per warrant our shareholders have approved the issuance of the warrants and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination if we do not complete our initial business combination the loans will not be repaid if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination instead of conducting a tender offer to allow our public shareholders to seek redemption of their shares our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for such any transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not complete a business combination that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the sec’s “penny stock” rules the agreement for our business combination however may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including interest earned on his her or its portion of the trust account to the extent not previously released to us only in the event of  our redemption of  of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period  if that public shareholder elects to redeem ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to shareholders’ rights or prebusiness combination activity or  if that public shareholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources the following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses • our obligation to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction • our obligation to redeem ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination • our outstanding warrants and the potential future dilution they represent • our obligation to either repay or issue private warrants upon conversion of up to  of working capital loans that may be made to us by our sponsor officers directors or their affiliates and • our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares as well as the private warrants and underlying securities and any securities issued to our sponsor officers directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms if we succeed in effecting our initial business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business subsequent to our initial business combination we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a blank check company incorporated in the british virgin islands on december   as a business company with limited liability this means that our
