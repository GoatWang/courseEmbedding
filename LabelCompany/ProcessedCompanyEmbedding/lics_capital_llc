decisions for a toptier venture capital fund in silicon valley focused on cloud mobile and big data our partner offers a wealth of expertise for any business looking to raise venture capital priya thatte digital marketing expert digital umamipriya owns and operates a fullservice online marketing agency dedicated to strategy and implementation looking to reach an audience priya is an expert in campaign management content management and organic growth our process we work in the gap between business development and product development some people call this user experience design we prefer the no cap internal combustion engine validate the idea first we listen maybe youd like more sales maybe youd like to build a new product regardless we can help flush out assumptions find your strengths and highlight opportunities within your existing business model looking for investors need a product roadmap need a new pitchdeck we can help design the screens now that weve got the what figured out its time to figure out the how in most cases well kick things off with a quick wireframing session with you and your team we call this a design studio informed by our collective wireframes well work out the details and provide your team with a highfidelity prototype that looks and feels like the real product   test the design before a single line of code hits the page we recommend testing your prototypes performance in the wild or rather in the hands of your target audience we call these usability tests we love this step because we get instant actionable feedback that we can apply directly towards your product and business goals refine the product after a round of revisions from the usability tests well want to share our designs with your development team we love a tough crowd ideally we plug a few holes together and nail down the logic after the logic is fully baked well want to review the look and feel with your marketing team we call these meetings design reviews build the platform once weve achieved stakeholder approval we build the stack our wish is that every project starts with a design so clear that optimal code is immediately possible well make sure the entire dev team knows exactly what to work on and when to have it finished short on developers we can build your product ourselves using cuttingedge code measure the results performance is on our radar from the very start we love informed guesses and were not afraid to commit to what good numbers should look like moving forward well help you find what to look for how to look for it and where to focus your attention based on actionable user metrics i have an idea and i need a prototype we love results our clients typically look to raise capital launch a product or add value to their services take a look
