chains chairman matthew drapkin unloaded  million shares in ruby tuesday on friday on sunday he resigned and was replaced by the companys ceo jj buettgen ruby tuesday noted the change in a terse threesentence sec filing this morning it noted that the chairman change was effective immediately whats more drapkin barely profited from the sale in  drapkin along with steven becker and their dallasbased investment firm becker drapkin management bought up  shares paying  million drapkin amassed more shares as a director and then chairman and sold most of those shares on friday for  to  a share or around  million drapkin had quickly taken a major role in the company after he and becker paired with carlson capital in  to form an activist investor group ruby tuesday under founder sandy beall quickly gave the group two seats on its board rather than face a proxy fight carlson capital and becker drapkin then split their group beall ultimately retired buettgen replaced him as ceo late last year and drapkin was elevated to the chairmanship but results have been hard to come by this year amid a tough environment for casual dining concepts—an environment so tough that even a onetime bright spot like bjs restaurants has suffered sales declines ruby tuesdays primary competitors chilis and applebees have been marketing heavily and investing in their stores price competition has been intense and ruby tuesday has shifted its product strategy from bealls failed upscaling idea back to its lowercost burgercentric roots the chains struggles were punctuated by a samestore sales decline of  percent in its most recent quarter and predictions that comparable store sales will be down in the high single digits this year as the chain adjusts  remember ruby tuesday had been flirting with bankruptcy before a surprisingly good quarter in  led to a surge in its stock price that enabled the company to use a secondary offering to pay down some debt now ruby tuesday is sinking again and its

photographers who took them but also on all the vendors that are showcased in them that’s an example of updating the site to modern standards which hadn’t really been done how do you see all this translating to dollars and cents md the overhaul of the websites product offerings and technology platforms has been expensive from  to  operating expenses increased at nearly four times the rate at which revenue grew now the vast majority of the investment spending is behind them just as revenue growth is starting to accelerate assuming only modest success on the transaction side our basecase model assumes  annual revenue growth over the next two to three years which because of the incremental profitability on that revenue would result in ebitda nearly doubling by  to around  million we can come up with credible scenarios that result in much higher growth than that what upside do you see in the shares trading recently at just over  ew given the quality of the business and its prospects for growing at extremely high incremental margins we believe that an evebitda multiple of x is easily warranted using x on our estimates for  that would result in a share price of nearly  we think that’s conservative – if ebitda is growing  per year the stock is unlikely to trade at only x ebitda md with respect to downside protection we like that the company currently has  million in cash on the balance sheet almost  of the market cap in the normal course of business we expect that cash to nearly double in three years to  million that would give them plenty of flexibility to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions andor to judiciously buy back stock as the business scales we also see xo as a very attractive acquisition target for yelp priceline grubhub or a host of other bigger internet companies there are almost no smallcap independent internet media companies left – they all get bought especially those that have dominant positions in attractive markets and the buyout multiples tend to be quite big news corp paid x evebitda for move inc the same multiple priceline paid for opentable homeaway was acquired by expedia for x applying these types of multiples to xo the stock is worth   per share is there a threat one of those bigger players decides to build rather than buy its way into xo’s market md xo’s ceo comes from google and tells a funny story when

heard them mention going after the wedding market if anybody wants to be in the space the smart move would be to buy the market leader from internet media to refrigerants explain your investment case for hudson technologies hdsn ew the company’s two main businesses are reselling virgin gases that are used in commercial and residential airconditioning systems and also reclaiming recycling and then reselling those same reusable gases today the virgingas business makes up about  of total revenues with the reclamation piece making up most of the rest while it’s a small player in virgin gas it has a roughly  share of the recycling market the crux of the thesis revolves around the montreal protocolrequired phaseout by the end of  of r the dominant refrigerant gas in use today it can still be used but the huge installed base will have to rely on the recycled version rather than virgin given that airconditioning units have  to year useful lives there’s a good long tail on the demand for aftermarket r as a result we expect a dramatic increase in the demand for hudson’s reclaimed gas that’s just math while r usage will slowly decline as people upgrade their units the remaining base will need supply to replace the virgin gas being phased out which has already largely happened that will produce a highly favorable mix shift for the company away from virgingas sales and into reclaimed gas where they earn more than twice the gross margin md a big added kicker is that in the new supplydemand environment the price of r will likely continue to increase five years ago it was selling for  a pound but as the environmental protection agency has been communicating over the years about the phaseout prices have risen and are now at alltime highs in the investment snapshot

of higher prices should flow pretty much straight through to the company’s bottom line there is some risk producers of virgin r in the near term get more aggressive to clear out inventory which could put downward pressure on prices but they have shown no inclination to do so and before long will be ceding pricesetting control to companies like hudson the bigger risk is that prices go up too far too fast and incent people to replace their units that use r faster than they would have otherwise we continue to watch prices closely but think the odds are very valuation metrics  hdsn sp  pe ttm

the bottom line the mandated phaseout of the virgin form of the primary product the company sells should result in a dramatic increase in the sales price and sales volume of the recycled version of the same product it also sells at much higher margins says eric ward on his  estimates the shares even after a big recent pop trade at less than x evebitda sources company reports other publicly available information         much in favor of steady price increases as scarcity builds you haven’t mentioned the news two weeks ago that hudson had been awarded a big contract with the department of defense which caused the stock to pop  ew yes it’s a fiveyear contract with a fiveyear renewal option to supply refrigerants compressed gases cylinders and related items to military installations it’s
