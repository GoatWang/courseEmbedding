 january   dear shareholder the januarythroughdecember period was one of considerable uncertainty for investors the economy continued to weaken resulting in ongoing corporateprofit disappointments in an attempt to spur growth the federal reserve began lowering interest rates in january the latter part of the period was extraordinary stocks plunged in the immediate wake of the september terrorist attacks but then rallied through the fourth quarter as the fed stepped up its easing campaign and as success on the war front lessened risk worries in the end most major equity indexes finished the year with significant losses while bonds at least highquality bonds performed well in this environment money market asset flows were volatile demand for shortterm securities was often high with investors seeking safety and liquidity when uncertainty rose on the other hand investors were sometimes quick to exit money market funds in response to encouraging economic news credit suisse cash reserve fund the fund had total net assets of about  million on december   compared with about  million at the start of the period our general strategy through the period was to attempt to lock in higher yields farther out on the yield curve in the belief correct as it turned out that the fed would continue to lower rates the funds average weighted maturity was  days as of december   up from  days a year earlier the funds annualized yield for the sevenday period ended december   was  with waivers and reimbursements as we look ahead we believe that we are at or very close to the bottom of the interestrate cycle as the fed has hinted we are therefore likely to shift in favor of shortermaturity securities at some point in order to have more flexibility to act when and if shortterm rates begin to rise on the other hand the yield curve for money market securities has remained relatively steep and at present we remain focused on longerterm securities we will continue to monitor economic and market trends very carefully the fund will remain focused on highquality securities in order to attempt to provide competitive returns without compromising safety or stability of principal we

credit suisse new york tax exempt fund annual investment advisers report december   january   dear shareholder we are pleased to present the annual report for credit suisse new york tax exempt fund covering the year ended december   the impact of the terrorist attacks of september   and the onset of an economic recession has affected the economy of new york and the country as a whole new york state and new york city have been particularly affected and are facing budget constraints and increased unemployment rates these factors among others and the performance of the fund are discussed in detail in the letter below from the funds subinvestment adviser blackrock institutional management corporation we will continue to focus on providing investors with a high level of current interest income in accordance with the funds objective in the current interest rate and economic environment we hope you find this report helpful thank you for your continued confidence and support james p mccaughan chairman the onset of a recession combined with the tragedy of september th has impacted the us economy and especially that of new york economic growth in new york ceased after september th new york states unemployment has grown to  in december  up from  in november and at its highest level since march  private sector employment has lost approximately  jobs since september  most of the job losses are concentrated in new york city while the state benefits from its broad and diverse economic base and its substantial wealth and resources the impact on the states budget has been substantial the state will use up the  billion surplus from fiscal year  to meet its budgetary needs during fiscal year  it is projected that the state will close fiscal year  with a  billion deficit and will need to close a potential  billion deficit in fiscal year  a fiscally sound budget produced in a relatively timely manner will likely be necessary in order for the state to maintain its aa rating from sp  the states fiscal health is directly linked to that of new york city the demise of the world trade center and the devastation to lower manhattan has impacted and can be expected to continue to impact the citys business structure new york city has lost approximately  jobs since september th and has seen its unemployment rate grow to  in december  up from  in july  the city projects that it will close fiscal year  in balance fiscal year  will probably present the city with a greater challenge with a  billion budget gap currently being projected this uncertainty has prompted moodys to change the outlook on new york citys a rating to negative during the second half of the year the federal open market committee eased rates an additional  basis points for a total of  basis points of easing during  the horrible events that took place on september th were the driving force behind the aggressive easing in the second half of the year as  basis points of easing occurred after september th assets for credit suisse new york tax exempt fund closed the year ended december   at  million with the continued aggressive easing stance taken by the federal reserve during the second half of the year the fund continued to look for what it considered to be attractive opportunities to invest further out the yield curve the fund was able to increase its position in several attractively priced short bonds and general market notes on december st the average weighted maturity of the fund stood at  days the day annualized yield was  with waivers and reimbursements and the one year return was  the fund seeks to continue to provide investors with a high level of current interest income exempt from federal new york state and new york city personal income taxes as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity we appreciate your continued support and investment in the fund blackrock institutional management corporation  the interest on new york municipal obligation is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from new york state and new york city personal income taxes a portion of income may be subject to state local and city taxes or the federal alternative minimum tax this fund may be riskier than a more geographicallydiverse municipal moneymarket fund additionally the risk of a downturn in the us economy particularly in new york city and new york state has been heightened by the terrorist attack on the world trade center on september   it is likely that new york city and new york state will suffer financial difficulties as a result which could adversely affect the ability of new york municipal issuers to make payments of principal and interest as well as the credit rating market value and yield of securities of such issuers if the fund has difficulty finding attractive new york municipal securities to purchase the amount of the funds income that is subject to new york taxes could increase
