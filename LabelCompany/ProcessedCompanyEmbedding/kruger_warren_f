kruger missundermiss processing and cache flushing patent number  abstract described herein are systems and methods that reduce the latency which may occur when a level one l cache issues a request to a level two l cache and that ensure that a translation requests sent to an l cache are flushed during a context switch such a system may include a work queue and a cache such as an l cache the work queue comprises a plurality of state machines each configured to store a request for access to memory the state machines can monitor requests that are stored in the other state machines and requests that the other state machines issue to the cache a state machine only sends its request to the cache if another state machine is not already awaiting translation data relating to the that request in this way the requesttranslation traffic between the work queue and the cache can be significantly reduced type grant filed august   date of patent october   assignee advanced micro devices inc
