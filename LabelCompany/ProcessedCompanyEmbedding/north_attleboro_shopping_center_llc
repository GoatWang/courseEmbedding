attleboro — one of the town’s oldest mobile home parks will soon be home to new tenantsplans for a new shopping center are en route for the acre plot that once stood home to whispering pines mobile home park across from emerald square mall on route the shopping complex called shops at emerald on town paperwork will include an anchor store and a few restaurants town planner nancy runkle said a mockup by developer carpionato group on the company’s website shows six buildings including la fitness and jared jewelers as potential retailers the lot is estimated to carry about  parking spaceskelly coates senior vice president of development with the company said four buildings will be retail space and two buildings are reserved for offices he said the development is about  percent preleased but he could not confirm any tenants as of yetcoates said the project still needs to undergo a site plan review and other permits with the town but the company hopes to begin construction late this summer with a fall  open datecoates said the plaza will not be called shops at emerald although a new name was not yet availablethe project is independent of emerald square mallthe rhode islandbased developer has been busy with properties down route  over the last few years most recently with the new shoppes at mayfaire plaza on the corner of may street and route  in attleboro and a south attleboro plaza dubbed shops on washington at the intersection of routes   and athe former owners of whispering pines thomas and patricia gaudette sold the lot to shops at emerald llc for a little over  million in july  state law requires a twoyear notice of sale to residents in a mobile home community before they are expelled from the propertyover the past few months tenants have slowly
