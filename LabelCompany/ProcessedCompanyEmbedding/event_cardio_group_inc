potential for event cardio group ecgi huge market potential for event cardio group ecgi two years ago last week the world became fully aware if they weren’t already of the severe risks of breast cancer when hollywood starlet angelina jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy  breast cancer the number one killer cancer among women has seen awareness grow exponentially since first lady betty ford underwent a mastectomy in  in her fight with the disease  while billions are spent every year to “treat” those already affected event cardio group inc ecgi could finally get to market the one product women everywhere need at an affordable price compared to the costs of the traditional mammogram want to crush the markets and make profits of   even  click here to make sure you get all of our penny stock alerts ecgi stock quote close  change  chg   high  low  open  prev close  volume  avg volume  day rel strength  market cap m wk high  wk low  in june  john bentivoglio ceo of event cardio group took control  of the cumulative voting power of sunrise holdings limited and soon after entered into a  agreement with life medical technologies inc  for the exclusive rights to distribute breastcare dts in the us and certain other territories  the world first got a look at what breastcare dts was all about from an interview with carol fitzgerald ceo of life medical at the time hosted on dell’s youtube channel  seeing how this device “could be” a more medical version of the selfexamination attempting to detect breast cancer with the device for slightly less than the price of a standard victoria secret bra seems like a nobrainer doing some research on the breastcare dts device aetna nyse aet notes the device to be “experimental and investigational” despite its fda clearance to be used adjunct to mammography for detecting breast diseases including breast cancer  being that it in the us at least needs to be used along with the industry’s “standard” detection system it seems that its benefit would be of no use  then again breast cancer is not bound to the us which means that with the right distributors developing countries who lack the medical infrastructure could be a massive target market if the product were to become manufactured and ready for shipment while the product breastcare dts a nondisposable product could serve its purpose for multiple exams the money is due to be in the sale of the two round soft disposable pads that are placed under the bra for  minutes allowing the  heatsensitive chemical sensors that change color to noninvasively check for abnormalities what market could breastcare dts serve it goes without saying that early detection is a key to surviving an almost unavoidable disease for women worldwide  the ability to have access to the product for athome testing would be an incredible advancement in breast cancer awareness if and when the product is available no woman wants to go in for a mammogram just as no man wants to go in for a prostate exam  what if a tumor was to appear weeks after a mammogram  the next one isn’t “supposed to be” conducted for another year whereas with the breastcare dts a product owner could examine themselves at home just as often as they conduct their selfexamination although it appears to be cleared only for use by licensed physicians in the us countries like indonesia india and china immediately come to mind along with a host of others who trump the us population and would benefit greatly from an affordable detection method  when carol fitzgerald mentioned “under ” in her interview immediately the possible revenue numbers became significant enough that further research was required breast cancer according to the american cancer society states that an invasive form of the disease are found in about  out of  women under the age of  and that women are  times more likely to develop the disease than men  it was reported that around  women in the us died last year from breast cancer and almost  million women either undergoing treatment or having completed treatment had a history with the deadly disease  seeing the billions of dollars rack up on treating breast cancer astrazeneca nyseazn founded “breast cancer awareness month” and the little pink ribbons became how once a year americans can feel they’re donating to help find a cure which in fact they are what is breast cancer worth studies have shown that detecting the disease while it is still in its localized stage has a years survival rate of  which if effectively detected early could slow the rate of someone dying every  minutes in the us from it  while the amount spent on breast cancer in  was cited to be  billion that amount is sure to have increased substantially since yet early detection of the disease is still subject to the two traditional forms mammography and selfexamination but that could soon change in  the fda approved a device called the somov automated breast ultrasound system abus which targets women with “dense” breast and scans the entire breast in about one minute  in  dune medical devices received premarket approval for their marginprobe system which too late for early detection is used after cancerous materials have been removed to ensure none exists in the nearby regions  circadia health inc has recently raised  million privately and offering another  million of series a preferred shares to develop their “itbra” which is worn inside the bra and works in a very similar facet as the breastcare dts so what’s ecgi worth in what appeared to be a fund raising effort the company issued  shares of ecgi to an accredited investor for  share on november    on january  the company issued  shares valued at  to satisfy the balance of their  obligation to life medical technologies  with  shares belonging to the former ecg’s stockholders john bentivoglio and parties the public float of roughly  has barely seen the light of day since the name change although shares are currently  below where the “accredited investor” acquired ecgi at the assumed  upside is not as appealing as seeing who is running the company that has the exclusive rights to distribute breastcare dts  a manufacturing deal andor distribution deal to go along with it would be a clear case for buying shares for a shortterm trade looking for the best

mammograms and the abus for those with dense breasts for now  as the concept of “early detectionearly awareness” surrounds the possibilities of breastcare dts becoming a real available product in the near future such is the case for ecgi possibly seeing a great deal of appreciation in the same time period   in researching what ecgi is all about it appears that breastcare dts will simply be the funding product the company will use so it can pursue fda k clearance for their wireless and leadless advance cardiac monitor “now cardio” which could be another game changer for the medical device

announce it has contracted ceres technologies based in saugerties new york to engineer and manufacture breastcare dts™ mechanical electrical and chemical engineers at ceres are completing design and execution plans for the first production units to be completed midmarchan easytouse fda approved singleuse device breastcare dts™ is to be marketed as an adjunct to mammography and other procedures for the detection of breast cancer the patented device consists of two soft disposable pads that are lightweight and noninvasive and are  accurate as an early detector of possible breast cancerjohn bentivoglio chief executive officer and president of event cardio group stated breast cancer is the top cancer in women both in the developed and the undeveloped world with the incidence of breast cancer increasing early detection in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival remains the cornerstone of breast cancer controlceres has provided an overall estimated timeframe of  months of having a fully automated production line in operationthe refinement and design of the proprietary injection multiple headdispensing unit is under way which will be used to fill and seal the rows of chemical sensors that will be used to measure temperature gradations to indicate temperature differential between the three regions of the breasts with the devicethe full production line is expected to be capable of producing  million units per year with a single operation shift and as demand for the device increases can be ramped to include  or  shiftsbentivoglio concluded in all my years of being involved with pharmaceutical medical device and biotechnology manufacturers breastcare dts is one that i believe the consumer market has been in need of and were excited to finally be bringing it from fda k clearance to an available product developing countries with significant populations are lacking access to screening methods such as mammography and breastcare dts™ has the potential to become the core of governmentsponsored and other breast cancer screening programsnote the breastcare dts™ device is not intended to replace mammography ultrasound and other detection methods but to be used as an adjunct to these screening methods the combination of more than one screening method as is true with most medical testing provides the best opportunity to catch breast cancer early the advantage of breastcare dts™ being lowcost portable and highly effective without exposure to radiation makes it a very attractive and accessible adjunct for screening for breast cancer for use with and in between mammograms in the us and other developed countriesabout event cardio group incevent cardio group inc is a developer of medical diagnostic detection equipment that focuses on the

deposit a bond in escrow in the amount of  to ensure that there will be sufficient funds to pay lmt if it is successful in litigating its counterclaims against ecgiefil under article  of the license agreement efil acquired the exclusive right to manufacture and market breastcare dts in the united states canada and asia and the nonexclusive right to the rest of the world open territories other than latin america mexico and the carribean sea including the bahamas lmt retained a right of first refusal with respect to the open territories pursuant to paragraph  of the agreement if efil wishes to sell products in any of the open territories it must expend at least  towards its sales effort or have had  worth of net sales within  days or pay liquidated damages to lmt and lmt will have the exclusive right to market the product the complaint alleges that by investing in lmt and agreeing to pay some of lmts creditors and to market breastcare dts ecgi rescued lmt from the verge of bankruptcy which had resulted from mismanagement by lmts chairman of the board and vice president of business development carol fitzgerald the complaint further alleges that because of her long familiarity with the product ecgiefil nonetheless hired fitzgerald as a consultant to assist plaintiff with marketing the device the complaint alleges that in march  in accordance with the licensing agreement efil designated certain territories including australia as additional marketing territories in march and april  ecgiefil then entered into a series of agreements with medpac an australian company which sought a sublicense to develop and market breastcare dts under that  million sublicense agreement with ecgi medpac allegedly paid  to ecgi receiving a promissory note from plaintiff and exclusive distribution rights for breastcare dts according to the complaint however utilizing confidential information that she obtained from ecgiefil fitzgerald sought to interfere with medpacs future investments in ecgiefil by falsely representing to medpac that ecgiefil did not have a license to market the product in australia to cause medpac to declare that ecgi was in breach of the promissory note and agreement and demand immediate payment of the note on november   lmt issued a notice to declare plaintiff in breach of the licensing agreement in connection with the sublicensing agreement plaintiffs entered into with medpac according to lmt although efil had notified lmt on march   that it claimed australia new zealand and several other countries as open territories it had not provided evidence of expending at least  towards sales efforts or having net sales of at least  as required by section  of the licensing agreement lmts notice of breach asserted that penalties were due to it and that the sublicensing rights to the open territories claimed by plaintiffs had reverted to lmt and that unless the breach was cured within  days lmt would take action to protect its rights under the contract according to plaintiffs they have met the  expenditure requirement by paying more than  to settle judgments entered against lmt fitzgerald and the lmt directors which otherwise would have resulted in lmt losing its patent for breastcare dts the complaint further alleges that lmt also sought to interfere with the relationship between ecgiefil and ceres the company that was developing a manufacturing process for the product for plaintiffs by demanding information regarding the production line that ceres was developing for plaintiffs the complaint alleges that before providing the information to lmt and fitzgerald plaintiff required defendant and fitzgerald to sign a nondisclosure agreement which they refused to do then on december   by means of what plaintiffs characterize as a bad faith request lmt sought pursuant to section  a of the licensing agreement to obtain information from ceres regarding its improved intellectual property affidavit of carol fitzgerald ¶  including information regarding the work that ceres had produced including the contract for ceres to build a new breastcare dts production line letter from carol fitzgerald dated december   at  fitzgerald affidavit exhibit b finally on december   lmt wrote to plaintiffs demanding milestone payments and minimum royalty payment for sales of sublicenses pursuant to sections   and  of the licensing agreement the complaint asserts three causes of action  for a declaratory judgment that plaintiff had met the expenditure requirement of paragraph  and therefore is not in breach of the licensing agreement  breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by lmt in issuing the default notice in order to deprive ecgiefil of its rights to receive its benefits under the licensing agreement and  tortious interference with prospective economic relations by seeking to induce medpac to cease investing in ecgiefil lmt answered and counterclaimed alleging that under the licensing agreement lmt had a right to share information regarding any developments or improvements made to the breastcare dts device and that lmt requested access to work performed by ceres on the development of the device but that plaintiff refused such access lmt further alleges that efil breached the licensing agreement by wrongfully claiming and reselling the rights to certain countries when they did not have the right to do so and by ignoring lmts right of first refusal with respect to those countries for that reason according to lmt on november   it sent plaintiff the notice of breach of contract and although plaintiff had  days to cure the breach was never cured lmt asserts two counterclaims  breach of contract against efil for failing to cure in response to the november   notice of breach and failing to make payment in response to the december   request for payment in connection with the breach and  breach of contract against ecgi for denying lmt access to view and inspect any improvements made to the breastcare dts device by ceres resulting in lmts loss of several potential investors a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence  a likelihood of success on the merits  irreparable injury absent the granting of the preliminary injunction and  a balancing of the equities in the movants favor gilliland v acquafredda enters llc  add   st dept  citing cplr  nobu next door llc v fine arts hous inc  nyd    where the alleged harm is compensable in money damages it is not considered irreparable harm lgc usa holdings inc v taly diamonds llc  add   st dept  in its first request for preliminary relief lmt alleges that on june   ecgi entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire the outstanding shares of ambumed inc ambumed a company which provides electrocardiography support including a hourday monitoring center under the name national cardiac monitoring center ncmc lmt alleges that if the transaction were to take place it would drastically deplete plaintiffs resources and would likely cause plaintiffs to be incapable of making payments due to lmt therefore pending resolution of this action lmt first seeks an order preventing ecgiefil from making the payment of  to ambumed which lmt alleges is due on closing in response to defendants motion plaintiffs submit the affidavit of john bentivoglio the president of ecgi amd efil who states that on july   five days before defendants motion was filed ecgi closed on the acquisition of ambumed since the  was to be paid to ambumed on closing of the stock purchase the court concludes that defendants request to estop plaintiffs from making that payment to ambumed or any other party has been rendered moot by the closing and defendants first request for preliminary relief is therefore denied lmt next requests that ecgi be ordered to surrender all lmt intellectual property relating to breastcare dts specifically any improvements made to the device by ceres and that lmt be permitted to contact ceres to work their own design and build of the production line for production and sale of the device for its latin american territories according to lmt ceres had been required to sign a noncompete and nondisclosure agreement with plaintiffs which prohibited ceres from meeting with lmt in their response to defendants motion plaintiffs submit the affidavit of kevin brady president and ceo of ceres who states that ceres was hired by plaintiffs to develop a plan for a production line for the breastcare dts device should the production move forward and that no modifications or improvements have been made to the design of the device by ceres brady indicates that ceress work has been limited to the feasibility and scope of work for ceress production line brady further states that he is not aware of any reason that lmt could not take the technical specifications for the device which originated with lmt and were provided to ceres and work with another company to develop the device in addition on november   counsel for plaintiffs wrote to the court with a copy to counsel for defendant indicating that in an effort to resolve the dispute and without prejudice to plaintiffs position that no intellectual property under the licensing agreement was in fact at issue plaintiffs had waived with respect to defendant its noncompete and nondisclosure provisions regarding ceres technology inc and have agreed that lmt may have access to the feasibility study being developed by ceres letter of alexander tripp dated november   to the extent that lmt is seeking access to changes in its intellectual property made by ceres it has failed to respond to bradys sworn statement that no such improvements to the device have been made nor has lmt responded to tripps letter indicating that lmt may now contact ceres and may have access to the feasibility study conducted by ceres for these reasons lmts second request is moot as well lmt next asks that the court require plaintiffs to produce documents in response to plaintiffs first request for documents which were served on or around june  fn order to show cause at  lmt has failed to provide the court with its document requests though plaintiffs have provided their responses and objections to the requests which contain the  numbered requests and which were served on defendant on or about july   more important lmt has failed to submit an affirmation that counsel for defendant has conferred with counsel for plaintiffs in a good faith effort to resolve the discovery issues raised by the motion as required by  nycrr  see yargeau v lasertron  add   th dept  lmts request for an order requiring plaintiffs to produce documents requested by lmt is therefore denied lmt next requests that the court enforce the terms of the licensing agreement and that all rights for the breastcare dts device be returned to lmt it is unclear to the court specifically which terms of the licensing agreement lmt is asking the court to enforce in connection to its motion for preliminary relief but to the extent that it is seeking the money damages specified in its counterclaims money damages are not relief that can properly be obtained by means of a preliminary injunction see lgc usa holdings inc v taly diamonds llc  add at  with respect to its request that all rights for the breastcare dts device be returned to lmt it is unclear to the court whether defendant is seeking to terminate the licensing agreement relief it did not seek in its counterclaims or whether it is seeking access to its intellectual property with respect to breastcare dts in any case such relief if justified would at best be appropriate as final and not preliminary relief since a mandatory preliminary injunction one mandating specific conduct by which the movant would receive some form of the ultimate relief sought as a final judgment is granted only in unusual situations where the granting of the relief is essential to maintain the status quo pending trial of the action jones v park front apts llc  add   st dept internal quotation marks and citation omitted no such unusual situations exist here finally lmt seeks an order requiring ecgiefil to post a  million bond to ensure that should lmt be successful on its counterclaims there will be sufficient funds to pay the amount owed as discussed above a party seeking a preliminary injunction must show among other things that it will be irreparably harmed absent the granting of preliminary relief gilliland v acquafredda enters llc  add at  furthermore alleged harm that is compensible in money damages is not considered irreparable harm lgc usa holdings inc v taly diamonds llc  add at  perhaps for that reason it is rare that the party seeking injunctive relief here defendant counterclaimplaintiff is the party seeking the posting of a bond rather most frequently the posting of an undertaking is required from the party seeking the injunction to insure that if it is finally determined that he or she was not entitled to an injunction that party will pay the party enjoined all damages and costs which may be sustained by reason of the injunction cplr  b there have been occasions however where a defendant has been ordered to place funds in escrow pending the conclusion of the litigation  though even then the plaintiff seeking the escrow order was directed to post an undertaking in connection with the requested preliminary injunction  w th llc v acg credit co ii llc  add  st dept  granting an undertaking is within the discretion of the court however in exercising its discretion the court must not consider defendants speculative or conclusory claims of potential financial losses peyton v pwv acquisition llc  misc d a  ny slip op u  sup ct ny county affd  add  st dept  here lmt has merely made conclusory allegations that should plaintiffs acquire the hour cardiac monitoring center which lmt describes as a call center plaintiffs resources would be substantially depleted and they would be unable to fulfill their financial obligations to defendant if it is successful on its counterclaims such conclusory assertions are insufficient to support an order requiring plaintiffs to post a  million bond it is therefore not necessary for the court to reach the likelihood that lmt will in fact succeed on the merits of its counterclaims or the balance of equities regarding the requested bond accordingly it is hereby ordered that the motion of defendant life medical technologies inc is denied in its entirety dated january   enter  jsc footnotes footnote  the court assumes that the reference to plaintiffs request for documents is either a typographical error and was intended to refer to defendants document request or was intended to refer counterclaimplaintiff search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing web google news
