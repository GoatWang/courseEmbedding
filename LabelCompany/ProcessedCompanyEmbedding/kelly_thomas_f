father or the criminal trial trials for cicinelli and ramos were scheduled to begin october   but actually began on december   proceedings concluded on january   with both ramos and cicinelli being found not guilty of any criminal charges after the verdicts the district attorneys office announced that it would not proceed with wolfes trial the protests picked up again after the acquittals on january    people were arrested for protesting after ignoring a dispersal order from the police slidebar kitchen involvementedit in june  michael reeves a former employee of the slidebar rocknroll kitchen filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination against jeremy popoff related to the beating the slidebar which is owned by popoff the guitarist for lit was the source of the call that caused police to report to the area and confront thomas reeves a bouncer at the establishment made statements to investigators claiming the slidebar had a policy to do anything necessary to keep loiterers out of the area and that his manager lied about thomas breaking into cars when calling the police to get them to respond more quickly he further claims that thomas was only loitering in the area that night and not causing trouble soon after making statements to investigators about what he saw that night he claims his managers were furious at him for it and slowly started taking away his responsibilities culminating with his firing two months later reeves also claims that popoff wanted everyone working at the slidebar to act as if the slidebar had nothing to do with the beating of thomas and his refusal to echo these statements is the chief reason why he was fired eric dubin an attorney representing the slidebar and popoff claims the suit is without merit and that it should be quickly dismissed dubin claims that this whole thing is all copy from blogs and sold to some lawyer and that while the call did originate from the slidebar that she the manager never used the phrase breaking into cars dubin further claims that everything in that lawsuit is  percent false and the real reason reeve was fired was because of a confrontation with a manager in front of customers on june   ron thomas organized a small gathering outside of the slidebar to protest the false police report thomas and popoff talked during the event and thomas later said that if the report was correct then i have no beef but that if there are any inconsistencies then i have to do what i have to do one day after this statement on june   after months of denials slidebar owner jeremy popoff stated on kfis john and ken show that one of his employees did in fact call police the night kelly thomas was beaten he declined to say what the employee reported citing the criminal investigation into thomas death but said a recording of the call has been reviewed by the district attorneys office and other investigators popoff and his lawyer denied the claims of an antihomeless policy during a press conference the issue was eventually solved in a settlement this sparked renewed protests in front of the slidebar kitchen cause of deathedit on september   orange county district attorney tony rackauckas held a press conference to announce the results of the investigation rackauckas announced that according to the orange county coroner the cause of death was asphyxia caused by mechanical chest compression with blunt cranialfacial injuries sustained during physical altercation with law enforcement rackauckas said thomas died because of the force of the officers on his chest which made it impossible for him to breathe causing thomas to become unconscious he then became comatose and died when taken off life support five days later according to rackauckas the coroner stated that the injuries to thomas face and head contributed to his death also contributing to his death were brain injuries facial and rib fractures and the extensive bruising and abrasions he suffered during the beating which left him lying in a growing pool of blood rackauckas said the toxicology report shows that thomas had no illicit drugs or alcohol in his system thomas was severely bleeding and struggled and pleaded i cant breathe dad help me the da stated that the officers did not reduce their level of force during the nearly minute assault in contrast dr gary vilke a professor of clinical emergency medicine at uc san diego testified for the defense during the trial he has investigated incustody deaths for  years and has published studies on mechanical compression he testified “i know he was breathing when the officers got off him because he was still talking as far as the cause of death it’s not asphyxiation”  the defense also implied medical treatment could have played a part in thomass death hospital records reportedly showed that a tube placed down his windpipe to assist his breathing had been pushed too far the prosecution dismissed these claims saying they did not apply and their value was not great enough lawsuit by fatheredit within days after the incident ron thomas the father of kelly thomas retained noted personal injury and civil rights attorney garo mardirossian to represent him in a civil action against the city of fullerton and the involved officers mr mardirossian then held several press conferences to address bringing criminal charges against officer manuel ramos corporal jay cicinelli and officer joseph wolfe and the civil lawsuit filed against the city these press conferences aired locally nationally and internationally heightening public interest and imposing pressure on the orange county district attorney to file criminal charges in the civil proceedings cathy thomas the mother of kelly thomas settled for  million cathy thomas was represented by another lawyer despite the subsequent not guilty verdicts in favor of officer ramos and corporal cicinelli mr mardirossian obtained a  million settlement just before manuel ramos the chief perpetrator was to testify in the civil jury trial the settlement precluded the officers who were fired from being rehired by fullerton police department criminal trialedit on january   manuel ramos was acquitted of

he appeared in a  booking photo released by fullerton pd kelly thomas was born april   to ron thomas a former orange county sheriffs deputy and cathy thomas thomas who was diagnosed with schizophrenia

these encounters ranged from minor infractions such as trespassing to a guilty plea in an assault with a deadly weapon case sixteen years prior incidentedit the crime scene in the immediate aftermath of the beating kelly thomas after his encounter with officers of the fullerton california police department on july   at about  pm officers of the fullerton police department responded to a call from the management of the slidebar that someone was vandalizing cars near the fullerton transportation center while investigating they encountered the shirtless and disheveled thomas and attempted to search him according to statements given by the officers thomas was uncooperative and resisted when they attempted to search him so backup was called now you see my fists fullerton police officer manuel ramos asked thomas while slipping on a pair of latex gloves yeah what about them thomas responded they are getting ready to f you up said ramos to which thomas replied start punching dude a video of the event surfaced thomas can be seen being uncooperative with the officers but sitting and being nonaggressive after the officers grab thomas to arrest him for stolen mail they apparently found thomas can be heard repeatedly screaming in pain while officers are heard repeatedly asking him to place his arms behind his back he audibly responds okay im sorry and im trying while the officers stretch his arm back the police officers claim that unable to get thomas to comply with the requests they used a taser on him up to five times according to a witness statement and the video footage and in the video thomas can be heard screaming for his father six officers were involved in subduing thomas who was unarmed and had a history of mental illness thomas was initially taken to st

instructed to attend to a police officers minor injury and then noticed thomas lying unconscious in a pool of blood orange county district attorney tony rackauckas gave a detailed account of the events during a press conference on september   using digital audio recording devices carried by the officers surveillance video from a pole camera at the fullerton transportation center and other evidence rackauckas provided evidence that thomas did comply with orders from ramos who had put on latex gloves and asked thomas now see my fists they are getting ready to fuck you up rackauckas went on to describe how thomas begged for his life before being struck repeatedly by the officers he was admitted to the hospital slipped into a coma and died five days later aftermathedit the story of his beating broke shortly before his death an investigation into the beating was undertaken by the orange county district attorney starting on july   and later the fbi became involved the decision to involve the fbi was praised by the american civil liberties union which claims the orange county district attorney has an abysmal record when investigating shootings with police involvement kelly thomas was removed from life support and died on july   five days after the beating initial reports claimed that thomas had been very combative with officers and two had suffered broken bones later the police department confirmed that no officers had suffered any broken bones and that no one other than thomas had any significant injuries by the end of july several news outlets had picked up the story and it had become international news on july   a large protest outside the fullerton police department was organized by several people including the victims father ron thomas ron thomas speaks to the fullerton city council and the media on august   many members of the public spoke out about the beating at the biweekly city council meeting at the fullerton city hall over  members of the

session lasted for approximately three hours the city attorney emphasized that the city council could not respond to the comments however following the public comment period discussion was given to provide clarification on the citys policy regarding the mentally ill in addition tony bushala a local developer and conservative activist announced plans to recall three members of the city council

deputy and cathy thomas thomas who was diagnosed with schizophrenia was a fixture among fullertons homeless population the death of thomas has sparked debate about systemic reforms in treatment of the mentally ill between  and  thomas had  encounters with the police these encounters ranged from minor infractions such as trespassing to a guilty plea in an assault with a deadly weapon case sixteen years prior incidentedit the crime scene in the immediate aftermath of the beating kelly thomas after his encounter with officers of the fullerton california police department on july   at about  pm officers of the fullerton police department responded to a call from the management of the slidebar that someone was vandalizing cars near the fullerton transportation center while investigating they encountered the shirtless and disheveled thomas and attempted to search him according to statements given by the officers thomas was uncooperative and resisted when they attempted to search him so backup was called now you see my fists fullerton police officer manuel ramos asked thomas while slipping on a pair of latex gloves yeah what about them thomas responded they are getting ready to f you up said ramos to which thomas replied start punching dude a video of the event surfaced thomas can be seen being uncooperative with the officers but sitting and being nonaggressive after the officers grab thomas to arrest him for stolen mail they apparently found thomas can be heard repeatedly screaming in pain while officers are heard repeatedly asking him to place his arms behind his back he audibly responds okay im sorry and im trying while the officers stretch his arm back the police officers claim that unable to get thomas to comply with the requests they used a taser on him up to five times according to a witness statement and the video footage and in the video thomas can be heard screaming for his father six officers were involved in subduing thomas who was unarmed and had a history of mental illness thomas was initially taken to st jude medical center in fullerton but was transferred immediately to the uc irvine medical center with severe injuries to his head face and neck one of the paramedics testified that he was first instructed to attend to a police officers minor injury and then noticed thomas lying unconscious in a pool of blood orange county district attorney tony rackauckas gave a detailed account of the events during a press conference on september   using digital audio recording devices carried by the officers surveillance video from a pole camera at the fullerton transportation center and other evidence rackauckas provided evidence that thomas did comply with orders from ramos who had put on latex gloves and asked thomas now see my fists they are getting ready to fuck you up rackauckas went on to describe how thomas begged for his life before being struck repeatedly by the officers he was admitted to the hospital slipped into a coma and died five days later aftermathedit the story of his beating broke shortly before his death an investigation into the beating was undertaken by the orange county district attorney starting on july   and later the fbi became involved the decision to involve the fbi was praised by the american civil liberties union which claims the orange county district attorney has an abysmal record when investigating shootings with police involvement kelly thomas was removed from life support and died on july   five days after the beating initial reports claimed that thomas had been very combative with officers and two had suffered broken bones later the police department confirmed that no officers had suffered any broken bones and that no one other than thomas had any significant injuries by the end of july several news outlets had picked up the story and it had become international news on july   a large protest outside the fullerton police department was organized by several people including the victims father ron thomas ron thomas speaks to the fullerton city council and the media on august   many members of the public spoke out about the beating at the biweekly city council meeting at the fullerton city hall over  members of the public spoke to the city council the vast majority of whom criticized the police among the speakers was ron thomas the father of kelly thomas as well as kelly thomass stepmother the public comment session lasted for approximately three hours the city attorney emphasized that the city council could not respond to the comments however following the public comment period discussion was given to provide clarification on the citys policy regarding the mentally ill in addition tony bushala a local developer and conservative activist announced plans to recall three members of the city council thought to have responded insufficiently to the beating the recall qualified on the ballot in february  with a recall election scheduled for don bankhead f dick jones and pat mckinley on june   consolidated with the statewide primary election on june   all three council members were successfully recalled by fullerton residents on saturday august   a large street protest was held outside of the fullerton city hall activists at that protest which was attended by hundreds of people called for the release of a surveillance video shot by cameras installed at the bus depot and carried signs with slogans like jail all killer cops and end police brutality in late september  the officers involved were arrested on murder charges local law enforcement personnel showed support by raising money for their bail and criminal defense thirty days after the incident all six officers involved in the beating were placed on administrative leave with pay and benefits intact several people including two members of the fullerton city council called for the resignation of police chief michael sellers who was later placed on medical leave in august  for undisclosed reasons sellers continued his medical leave for  months and resigned on february   having never returned to work  people have signed an online petition calling for the firing of all six police officers that were present during the beating fullerton city councilman bruce whitaker later went on television stating his belief that there was a coverup of the beating of thomas within the police department and that the six officers involved in the beating falsified their reports on the incident a preliminary hearing to determine if there is sufficient evidence for a trial was held on may   the court ordered that two of the police officers involved will stand trial manuel ramos was charged with seconddegree murder and involuntary manslaughter and jay cicinelli was charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force both officers pleaded not guilty at the second arraignment on july   attempts by the defendants to dismiss the charges were denied in september  officer joseph wolfe was indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter and use of excessive force on may   press reports indicated that the fullerton city council had agreed to pay thomas mother one million dollars as a settlement of her civil complaints against the city this did not impact the ongoing civil actions by thomas father or the criminal trial trials for cicinelli and ramos were scheduled to begin october   but actually began on december   proceedings concluded on january   with both ramos and cicinelli being found not guilty of any criminal charges after the verdicts the district attorneys office announced that it would not proceed with wolfes trial the protests picked up again after the acquittals on january    people were arrested for protesting after ignoring a dispersal order from the police slidebar kitchen involvementedit in june  michael reeves a former employee of the slidebar rocknroll kitchen filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination against jeremy popoff related to the beating the slidebar which is owned by popoff the guitarist for lit was the source of the call that caused police to report to the area and confront thomas reeves a bouncer at the establishment made statements to investigators claiming the slidebar had a policy to do anything necessary to keep loiterers out of the area and that his manager lied about thomas breaking into cars when calling the police to get them to respond more quickly he further claims that thomas was only loitering in the area that night and not causing trouble soon after making statements to investigators about what he saw that night he claims his managers were furious at him for it and slowly started taking away his responsibilities culminating with his firing two months later reeves also claims that popoff wanted everyone working at the slidebar to act as if the slidebar had nothing to do with the beating of thomas and his refusal to echo these statements is the chief reason why he was fired eric dubin an attorney representing the slidebar and popoff claims the suit is without merit and that it should be quickly dismissed dubin claims that this whole thing is all copy from blogs and sold to some lawyer and that while the call did originate from the slidebar that she the manager never used the phrase breaking into cars dubin further claims that everything in that lawsuit is  percent false and the real reason reeve was fired was because of a confrontation with a manager in front of customers on june   ron thomas organized a small gathering outside of the slidebar to protest the false police report thomas and popoff talked during the event and thomas later said that if the report was correct then i have no beef but that if there are any inconsistencies then i have to do what i have to do one day after this statement on june   after months of denials slidebar owner jeremy popoff stated on kfis john and ken show that one of his employees did in fact call police the night kelly thomas was beaten he declined to say what the employee reported citing the criminal investigation into thomas death but said a recording of the call has been reviewed by the district attorneys office and other investigators popoff and his lawyer denied the claims of an antihomeless policy during a press conference the issue was eventually solved in a settlement this sparked renewed protests in front of the slidebar kitchen cause of deathedit on september   orange county district attorney tony rackauckas held a press conference to announce the results of the investigation rackauckas announced that according to the orange county coroner the cause of death was asphyxia caused by mechanical chest compression with blunt cranialfacial injuries sustained during physical altercation with law enforcement rackauckas said thomas died because of the force of the officers on his chest which made it impossible for him to breathe causing thomas to become unconscious he then became comatose and died when taken off life support five days later according to rackauckas the coroner stated that the injuries to thomas face and head contributed to his death also contributing to his death were brain injuries facial and rib fractures and the extensive bruising and abrasions he suffered during the beating which left him lying in a growing pool of blood rackauckas said the toxicology report shows that thomas had no illicit drugs or alcohol in his system thomas was severely bleeding and struggled and pleaded i cant breathe dad help me the da stated that the officers did not reduce their level of force during the nearly minute assault in contrast dr gary vilke a professor of clinical emergency medicine at uc san diego testified for the defense during the trial he has investigated incustody deaths for  years and has published studies on mechanical compression he testified “i know he was breathing when the officers got off him because he was still talking as far as the cause of death it’s not asphyxiation”  the defense also implied medical treatment could have played a part in thomass death hospital records reportedly showed that a tube placed down his windpipe to assist his breathing had been pushed too far the prosecution dismissed these claims saying they did not apply and their value was not great enough lawsuit by fatheredit within days after the incident ron thomas the father of kelly thomas retained noted personal injury and civil rights attorney garo mardirossian to represent him in a civil action against the city of fullerton and the involved officers mr mardirossian then held several press conferences to address bringing criminal charges against officer manuel ramos corporal jay cicinelli and officer joseph wolfe and the civil lawsuit filed against the city these press conferences aired locally nationally and internationally heightening public interest and imposing pressure on the orange county district attorney to file criminal charges in the civil proceedings cathy thomas the mother of kelly thomas settled for  million cathy thomas was represented by another lawyer despite the subsequent not guilty verdicts in favor of officer ramos and corporal cicinelli mr mardirossian obtained a  million settlement just before manuel ramos the chief perpetrator was to testify in the civil jury trial the settlement precluded the officers who were fired from being rehired by fullerton police department criminal trialedit on january   manuel ramos was acquitted of seconddegree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the  death of thomas jay cicinelli was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force recall electionedit in a landslide june   recall election city

product software  business articles  essays order papers hire writer login kelly thomas– chief engineer of product software case study part i  assumptions a kelly thomas– chief engineer of product software  pat is trying to bypass the authority of kelly because he is directly communicating with the developers within his staff  kelly’s point of view with regards to business practices does not coincide with pat’s perspective  there are difficulties in accomplishing the current workload because of the staff cuts that happened before  kelly deems that he does not have the available staff that would work in the development of a prototype by the deadline in august  kelly is receiving pressure from his superior to produce a prototype despite the fact that there is a lack of resources to accomplish the existing work and more so with the additional product in the development list  kelly does not agree with the budget allocation and timeline as he perceives it as unrealistic             b pat lambert – director of marketing  the company needs to develop new products that will cater to a larger market for it to succeed in the marketplace  the scanning technology will be use by specific retail operations as well as other operations by scanning shoppers at the stores that will aid in acquiring information based upon the shoppers’ movement as well as make reports on shopping habits  the product development is minimal as a hardware and software technology which has been developed and tested  the new product needs to enter the market before the company’s competitors which needs a quick turnaround in development and implementation  the delay in the launching of a complete product will be costly and it will hinder the chance to capture the market with this new kind of technology  there is a need for the hiring of more contractors in order to work on the existing development and meet the deadline  it will be an additional cost and will reduce the first year roi nevertheless the capital investment will pay for itself in the span of  years because the product will be used and it only needs little additional investment  pat deems that the development team hinders rather than help the progress of bringing operations optimize in the market  pat feels that kelly is not giving her enough support             c cliff o’ connor – ceo acuscan  there is lack of robustness in the company and we need to address it by recapturing the market  budgetcuts have to be made in order to achieve the company’s goal  the development of new products is a necessity in order increase the company’s market share and profit  pat lambert and chris marinas are collaborating together in order to develop a product that will help the company in increasing its market share             d chris marinas – vice president of product development  the development department is undergoing a lot of pressure in order to perform and cut costs  the department needs to cut costs by   they need to think of ways to cutcosts without layingoff employees  chris has left the issues of getting the product into the market between kelly and pat because he believes that it is their responsibility  explanation of arguments a       cliff o’connor – since cliff is the ceo of acuscan it is understandable that his  primary objective is the company’s growth and profitability the company’s market shares are decreasing because their products are only limited to specific markets and it is becoming a commodity cliff’s responsibility is to improve the situation of the company despite the reaction of the employees about the changes that needs to be done in relation to this he also has the task of maintaining the costs within the budget as such he decided that the new development should be completed at less than  of the estimated costs and he also refuse to extend the deadline a       pat lambert – being the newly employed marketing director pat has the task to give ideas that will aid the company to become more profitable she has limited resources but still needs to accomplish the objectives that she believes will help the company pat deems that using existing technology in the retail market can work to create a new product for the market she is convinced that the product development group should work with her plan and timeline b      kelly thomas – being the director of development kelly is responsible in managing the existing work that he has with the company as well as think of ways on how to use the resources to sustain existing customers he also has to see to it that the products he creates are built to perform as expected since the resources are already consumed to its full capacity he is having difficulties in meeting the new development plan made by pat lambert kelly believes that expecting the limited resources to maintain current business contracts and also develop a new product is irrational and impossible             d chris martinas – being the vice president of product development he must operate in accordance with the objectives of the ceo as well as the current realities of his work environment the company’s decreasing profitability must be address but he wants to do it without layingoff employees he has to manage the existing budget and staff resources and at the same time finding ways to develop new products the first step that he made is the suggestion for each department to cut their expenses by  he left the decision on the department managers to think of ways for cost cutting in their area  sound or unsound arguments             a cliff o’ connor – he wants to prevent the company from reaching bankruptcy that is why he needs to do the necessary steps in order to increase profits his argument is logical in nature and sound because he has in mind the best interest and welfare of the whole company his efforts are designated in leading the company to a better future by directing the company to grow in its field             b pat lambert – pat’s responsibility is to think of innovative ways to utilize the company’s existing technology for different market shares and to develop a new product that will adhere to the demands of an emerging market pat has a sound vision of using the existing technology for different markets which could address the problem of the company’s limited resources however she does not have the support of the product development she is also very absorbed with the deadline that she has wherein she is trying to coincide all the necessary agenda into that time frame without giving due consideration to the other components that is needed to accomplish the system that she plans pat’s argument is emotional because it is merely based upon her desire to accomplish the goal that she has without giving importance to the other people and department in the company             c kelly thomas – he strongly believes that the deadline for the project is unreasonable as it cannot be completed within that time frame kelly was the original developer of the software product and he is becoming to involved in the ways by which the development should be completed kelly failed to see other alternatives in his midst like the process of outsourcing nevertheless he has the knowledge and expertise to make the necessary changes in the process because of his previous experience kelly’s argument is emotional because he is getting personally attached with the project that hinders him to see new alternatives it is still logical because he is using his knowledge based upon his experience to understand how the work should be done             d chris martinas – he recognizes the conflict between the marketing department and product development but he is uncertain on the proper thing to do chris understands the points of both sides but he does not know how to address the conflict his argument is logical because he has an objective perspective about the problem and he is not getting emotionally attached with it furthermore chris deems that the company should immediately cut costs without laying off employees in this sense his argument is logical because he is taking into consideration the past action of the company in cutting staff as well as the future goal of improving the company by minimizing costs he wants to address the problem through the least painful way that is possible   fallacious arguments a       kelly – “my staff cannot possibly get the project done by that date i do not have the resources and the project is too large” university of phoenix b      kelly – “pat has undercut my authority by talking directly to my staff to see if the work she needs done is feasible” university of phoenix             c pat – “the development of a prototype for a small test market by august should be able to be completed with minimal time and effort on the part of the existing staff” university of phoenix             d pat – “any delay in the deployment of the prototype and final product will impact the market as a competitor is also working on the development of a similar product in hopes to be the first to capture the market” university of phoenix conclusions  problems in the situation §  the company is experience a decrease in its profitability and is loosing market shares §  the company has limited resources to maintain the existing contracts that it has as well as sustain the development of a new product §  the ceo would like to accomplish the operation optimize by using only  of the budget  data arguments and reasoning for each problem §  decreasing profitability and loosing market shares – the profits are very low service revenues only contribute  of the revenue and new business only provided  from last year §  limited resources of the company – the company must balance its existing contracts and at the same time think of ways to enter new business ventures this is proven by the email on february   regarding a meeting from kelly thomas §  the ceo would like to finish the project by using  of the estimated budget – the company lacks the necessary budget to complete the project with the costs given by the marketing executive this is clearly proven by the email from cliff o’connor on february   regarding the operation optimize budget  underlying problem             the major dilemma of the company is the conflict between pat the new marketing executive and kelly the director of development pat has brilliant ideas and is also willing to explore new alternatives in order to accomplish her goals but she wants everything done by the august which is the deadline on the other hand kelly is challenging pat’s plan based upon his knowledge and own experience in the development of this software kelly was the one who created the flagship product which is why he knows the in and out of it from the history up to the code  alternative solutions             solution one the company should practice the process of outsourcing wherein the will outsource the work for the new development and leave the current staff to work on the existing contracts of the company they should develop a plan that can utilize an external company to develop the new products form their current technologies together with an exit methodology that involves shifting the development to the existing staff             solution two the product should be roll out in stages the company should get all the critical work done by the existing staff before the launch date by employing standard strategies of development and testing it is also possible to hire some consultants in order to fill the gaps the task should be accomplished by phase wherein one stage should be done first before moving to the other one   strengths and weaknesses             solution one strength – the process of outsourcing will surely aid with the resource needs and it will also pave the way for the current staff to focus on the company’s existing contracts this will surely have additional costs but the expense could be justified by the profit that would be gain in the development of a new product weakness – relying on outsourcing will put the fate of the development of this new technology with people who do not have the working knowledge of the company’s existing infrastructure the outside resources might overlook important concerns that the company’s employees will surely identify easily in relation to this the process of learning by the outside source to familiarize themselves with the system will surely slow down the development process moreover the company’s budget cannot sustain hiring additional consultants             solution two strength – designating the project in a series of phases would make sure that product development and testing are properly done all aspects of development will also work as expected this kind of plan will allow the existing employees of acuscan to work on the project which is very beneficial since they already know the software and they are committed with the success of the company weakness – the finish product will not be available to the market by the time that they expected and the competition might beat them they might loose their opportunity to improve their company because of their inability to produce a complete project for a new emerging market  recommended solution             based upon the data gathered from the reports and statements of the officials of the company the second solution is most applicable the company does not have the necessary employee to develop the complete project in line with this acuscan does not have the budget to hire a consulting firm moreover giving due consideration with the experience of the director of development even if the company does not have problems with budget or other areas of concern the project cannot be completed with efficiency full functionality and with high standards that acuscan is known for because of the limited time nevertheless if the company will roll out the operation in stages they could be able to create a stable product that can be brought to the market with additional features that can be added in phases which will ensure the functionality and efficiency of the product reference university of phoenix critical thinking gen assessment case study   related essay
