recently viewed advisor visit our page find an advisor contact us client login checklist  questions every advisor should be able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple – with the help of their advisor – built a business

centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than

american express is turning its attention back toward revenue growth after the loss of a major client in  and a period of emphasis on costcutting a renewed emphasis on corporate spending especially with small and mediumsize businesses appears to be paying off additionally a strengthening global economy is providing a tailwind for spending growth however evidence of an intense competitive environment continues to show up in results and the companys plans to further differentiate its rewards offerings lack specifics we are maintaining our  per share fair value estimatethe competitive environment in the consumer space remains intense excluding the effects of last years costco business loss total revenue expanded  but rewards spending grew by  on the same basis card member services spending expanded by  we think this indicates american express is having to pass on a larger share of discount revenue to customers in order to maintain market share furthermore though discount revenue as a percentage of billed business was stable during the quarter american express is passing on some economic benefits to merchants and acquirers through its optblue program we see few signs that pressure from merchants and cardholders will let up any time soonamerican express remains a payment method of choice for both large and small businesses and the companys efforts to grow in this area are likely to pay off  although large companies are continuing to cut back on travel and entertainment expenses american express global commercial business generated midsingledigit billed business growth driven primarily by small business volume businesstobusiness spending represents a multitrillion dollar opportunity and we believe american express benefits from high switching costs and a powerful brand asset in this arenaamerican express online banking efforts are continuing to bear fruit management indicated that the company has passed on only about  of rate increases to savings account customers and we dont expect competition to heat up any time soon we doubt that many consumers will be inclined to lock in low rates until rates provide significantly higher nominal returns and few banks seem desperate for deposit funds at the momentamerican express lending business is also performing well chargeoffs remain very lowthe company wrote off only  of loans during the quarter and balances grew at a healthy  annualized rate during the quarter we dont see any evidence that the company is chasing lowquality balances and expect credit losses to remain manageable in a downturn that said losses are sure to increase over time as the portfolio seasonsmarketing and promotion expenses grew by just  during the year as american express turned its customer acquisition efforts to the digital realm and other operating expenses fell by  on an adjusted basis over the same time period we expect a renewed emphasis on expense control combined with moderate growth in billed business and significant capital return to result in healthy earnings per share growth over our fiveyear forecast period bny mellons surprise ceo change raises questions about the firms directionby greggory warren cfa  morningstar research services llc  we were a bit surprised by todays announcement from widemoatrated bny mellon that chairman and ceo gerald hassell would be relinquishing his chief executive post immediately and would also step down from his role as chairman at the end of the year mainly because it wasnt clearly telegraphed to investors that said the choice of charles scharf former ceo of widemoatrated visa with previous banking experience at citigroup and jpmorgan chase to replace hassell as ceo and chairman at the end of the year seems to be a solid choice for a firm that has been pressured by activist investors the past several years to cut costs and improve topline growth which has proved difficult to pull off in an environment of historically low interest rates hassell had planned to retire once the firm showed progress on a series of goals that were put forth by the firm in  some of which were met last year however we had no indication that a management change was in the works we expect to hear more from the firm and to ask it plenty of questions when bny mellon reports secondquarter earnings on thursday but would expect scharf to be given at least six months to go through the business and put together a new strategy for the bank that said were not big fans of past calls from some activist investors for bny mellon to spin off or sell its assetmanagement business which had  trillion in aum at the end of march  making it one of the largest usbased asset managers this is a moaty business albeit not as moaty as its trustcustody operations that said it has served as a bit of a buffer for the firm during the past decade offsetting some of the impact of historically low interest rates and has provided some avenues for growth especially internationally we do not expect to make a change to our  per share fair value estimate for bny mellon as a result of the companys management changesolid net interest margin and aum gains lift bny mellons firsthalf results raising fve to by greggory warren cfa  morningstar research services llc  while there was little in widemoatrated bny mellons secondquarter results that would alter our longterm view of the firm we have increased our fair value estimate to  per share from  to reflect a greater increase in nearterm net interest margin improvements as well as assets under management than we forecast previously the companys secondquarter net interest margin of  was a large improvement over the prioryear period  and a slight shift upwards from the first quarter

imply a dividend yield of  through the first six months of  bny mellon repurchased more than  million shares for around  millionberkshire puts growing cash hoard to work fve raisedby greggory warren cfa  morningstar research services llc   weve increased our fair value estimate for berkshire hathaways class a b shares to   from   to reflect changes in our assumptions about revenue investment returns and profitability since our last update this fair value estimate change includes the impact of recent investments in oakwood homes store capital and home capital group berkshires exercise of its warrants to acquire  million shares of bank of americas common stock and the bid for oncor electric delivery it does not include the rumored  billionplus investment sprint reportedly solicited from warren buffett this past week which we believe berkshire would be willing to do at the right price it has more than enough dry powder on hand our new fair value estimate is equivalent to  and  times our projected book value per share estimates for  and  respectivelywe use a sumoftheparts methodology to derive our fair value estimate our valuation for berkshires insurance operations increased  to   per class a b share primarily due to changes in market expectations for the investment portfolio our value for kraft heinz which we value separately from the insurance operations remains at   per class a b share while our estimate for bnsf increased  to   per class a b share on slightly better coal volume through the first half of the year weve lowered our valuation for berkshire hathaway energy slightly to   per class a b share given the dilution from the oncor bid our fair value estimate for berkshires manufacturing service and retail operations increased  to   per class a b share and we also made a slight increase in our value for the firms finance and financial products division to   per class a share after raising our longterm expectations and incorporating the oakwood homes and home capital group deals into the segmentlooking more closely at berkshires insurance operations weve kept our underwriting forecasts for each of the firms four subsidiariesgeico general re berkshire hathaway reinsurance group or bhrg and berkshire hathaway primary group or bhpgin place but have projected a slightly higher yield on the segments investment portfolio as interest rates increase over time we’re also projecting stronger investment returns for the segment this year than we were projecting in our previous forecast the net result is a  increase in our value for the insurance operations to   per class a b share from   per class a b share we continue to be concerned with geicos relentless pursuit of growth given that it has come at the expense of profitability the past several years the auto insurers earned premium growth of  during the fourth quarter of  was one of the strongest quarterly results geico has ever put up with management accelerating underwriting activity as its peers pulled back from the market in response to spiking loss ratios driven by increases in both frequency and severity of claims geico continued to hit the gas pedal in the first quarter of  generating earned premium growth of  we dont expect the firm to maintain such an elevated rate of growth as we move forward seeing earned premium growth averaging between  during slightly above the  and  cagrs that geico generated during  and  respectivelygeicos average loss ratio of  the past twelve calendar quarters was worse than the  average level seen during  and the  level seen during  that said underwriting expenses continue to track down as the everincreasing size and scale of geicos business has allowed the auto insurer to generate an average expense ratio of  the past twelve calendar quarters better than the  level seen during  and the  level seen during  even so the firms overall combined ratio of  during the past three years puts profitability at levels not seen since  going forward we expect geicos combined ratio to improve only marginally during the next five years from  this year to  in  as for berkshires two reinsurance armsgeneral re and bhrgwere not expecting much in the way of growth given that the industry continues to struggle with a weak pricing environment driven by excess capacity that has been driven by the entrance of new players including hedge funds as well as the growth of alternative capital such as catastrophe bonds and the lack of largescale catastrophes which makes it harder for reinsurers to justify raising their rates while the firm expects reinsurance to be an unattractive business for at least the next decade general re and bhrg unlike many of their peers have the luxury of walking away from reinsurance underwriting when an appropriate premium cannot be obtained with both firms showing no real inclination to pursue growth in the current pricing environmentgiven the pricing environment that reinsurers continue to face we believe firms with more diverse insurance portfolios and that serve multiple distribution channels are much more likely to offset the negatives in the market and should be able to target profitable opportunities as they arise we feel that both general re and bhrg fall into this category that said berkshires reinsurance operations are still dealing with a number of runoff contracts so we expect the ability of the two firms to generate float aside from oneoff transactions like the aig deal done earlier this year to be limited with more than two thirds of berkshires overall float coming from its two reinsurance armsgeneral re  and bhrg we believe that further increases in the overall level of the companys insurance float which stood at around  billion at the end of the first quarter of  will be more difficult to come by for general re we continue to forecast lowsingledigit annual declines in earned premiums during  with expectations for an average combined ratio of  over the next five years as for bhrg were not expecting much premium growth during the next five years but do recognize that the more recent deal with aig will lift earned premium growth into positive territory from what continues to be a projection for lowsingledigit annual declines in earned premiums during  we also expect the firm to generate an average combined ratio of  over the next five years in an environment where the two reinsurers are intentionally reducing underwriting given that pricing is inadequate relative to the risk about the best we can hope for is tight enough expense controls and a lack of extremely adverse events allowing both firms to keep their combined ratios below the  mark as for the investment portfolio attached to the insurance operations which includes not only the equity and fixedincome portfolios but the firms cash balances we are now projecting a  annual increase in the overall value of these assets which includes both market gains and additions to the portfolio due primarily to marktomarket changes made to the portfolio after a strong first half showing following the exercise of berkshires warrants to acquire  million shares of bank of america common stock for  per share which was paid for by exchanging the  billion  preferred stock berkshire held in the bank berkshire became bank of americas largest shareholder outside of the major indexbased products providers like vanguard state street and blackrock with the bank becoming a top  stock investment holding for the firm while the investment in store capital a triplenet lease reit was much smaller at  million berkshire now holds a nearly  stake in the firm looking more closely at kraft heinz which we value separately from the insurance operations despite being held on their books our fair value estimate remains at   per class a b share with respect to berkshires other noninsurance operations weve increased our fair value estimate for bnsf  to   per class a b share on slightly better coal volumes through the first half of the year our new forecast has total unit volumes increasing at a  cagr during the next five calendar years up from  previously while this is slightly higher than the  cagr we saw during  much of the improvement is coming from a quicker recovery in coal shipments which were down  during  we also envision pricing being slightly more robust overall for bnsf with revenue per unit increasing at a  cagr during  we continue to expect pricing gains achieved during the next five years to outpace rail cost inflation which should contribute to ongoing improvements in profitability we believe that bnsfs operating ratio will improve from  during  to  by the end of our fiveyear forecast period putting the railroads profitability more on par with its most comparable peer union pacific which we have projected to have a  operating ratio by the end of weve reduced our fair value estimate for the insurers  stake in berkshire hathaway energy to   per class a b share from   after incorporating the firms purchase of energy future holdings  equity stake in oncor electric delivery which we give a  chance of being closed before the end of  into our model the dilutive impact of the deal would have been greater had it not been for the buffer created by time value of money considerations we still believe that the deal which values oncor at  times trailing earnings and  times  times goodwill adjusted book value to be a bit on the rich side given that the median pe multiple for our us coverage is about  times trailing earnings and the average pb multiple for utilities is about  times in todays market that said the entry of paul singer and his hedge fund firm elliott management into the bidding process has lowered our overall confidence in the deal being completed primarily because buffett and berkshire do not partake in bidding wars however bhes announcement discussions with the texas regulators regarding oncor’s independence and financial integrity as well as longterm investments in infrastructure and security should still give it a leg up in bankruptcy court even though singers hedge fund firm holds the majority of the efhs debtgoing forward we continue to expect bhes us regulated utilitiespacificorp midamerican energy and nv energyto continue to receive constructive ratecase outcomes and earn somewhere close to their current allowable returns on equity this would leave annual ebitda growth for these businesses in the  range over the next five years for northern powergrid we expect ongoing price reviews to allow the firm to generate midsingledigit annual ebitda growth over the next five years this is slightly higher than the rate of growth we are expecting for the firms pipeline and renewables businesses which assumes the nearterm prospects for additional renewables projects coming on line will be limited due to the expiration of federal tax credits our fair value estimate for berkshires regulated utilities is also equivalent to  times our  ebitda estimate putting it in line with our valuations for similar highquality utilities with favorable regulatory structures and aboveaverage growth opportunities our valuation also implies bhes pipeline group is worth  times ebitda in line with peer multiples and indicative of the higher returns that pipelines are able to realizewith regards to berkshires manufacturing service and retail operations our fair value estimate increased  to   per class a b share most of which was tied primarily to time value of money considerations our longterm forecast models past behavior by including bolton acquisitions to our future revenue projections with revenue increasing at a mid to highsingledigit rate the next five years as for profitability we see operating margins expanding by  basis points annually over the  level the segment reported in  with regards to companys finance and financial products division which includes clayton homes manufactured housing and finance cort business services furniture rental marmon rail car and other transportation equipment manufacturing repair and leasing and xtra overtheroad trailer leasing weve increased our fair value estimate for this unit slightly to   per class a b share after raising our longterm expectations and incorporating the oakwood homes and home capital group deals into the segment oakwood homes a private home building firm in colorado and utah was purchased by clayton homes it is the largest of the four sitebuild home building operators that clayton has acquired the past several years weve also assumed that the cad   billion line of credit that berkshire has extended to the struggling canadian mortgage lender home capital group which also came with a cad   million investment in the companys stock is being financed out of this division which had  billion in cash and cash equivalents in tis books at the end of the first quarter berkshires book value per class a equivalent share at the end of the first quarter of  was  we think the firm can continue to grow its book value per share at a highsingletodoubledigit rate going forward much as weve seen since the start of the new millennium this would leave book value per class a equivalent share at  at the end of this year and  at the end of  depending on the timing of us corporate tax reform berkshire will likely see a onetime step up in its book value as the deferred tax liability associated with its investment portfolio which amounted to  billion at the end of  and other assets gets written down to reflect a lower statutory us federal income tax rate our best guess is that this would result in at least a  increase in book value per share this is important as berkshire tends to trade on book value per share with the companys shares trading at  times book value on average the past five and  years and  times over the past fifteen years the shares traded as high as  times book value in  and  times book value last yearwhile berkshire closed out the first quarter of  with  billion in cash on its books a portion of that capital has already been spoken for for starters buffett has been fairly explicit about his desire to keep around  billion in cash on hand as a backstop for the insurance business we believe rest of the firms operations are also likely to require at least  of annual revenue on hand as operating cash which would amount to around  billion based on our topline forecast for  toss in another  billion as starter cash for capital spending projects which are likely to approach  billion this year and berkshire likely had  billion in dry powder at the end of the first quarter that could be used toward acquisitions and other investments as well as share repurchases and dividends since that time weve seen the firm commit  billion to the oncor deal another  billion to stock purchases and around  billion as a line of credit for the struggling home capital group this would reduce that dry power amount to around  billion that said the firm likely pulled in another  billion in free cash flow during the second quarter so were likely looking at dry powder in the  billion range which would be more than enough to provide a capital infusion to sprintthat is of course assuming that berkshire gets high interest paying preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares down the road in return for the buffett seal of approvalstrong organic growth and market gains lift blackrocks q aum higher fve raised to  per shareby greggory warren cfa  morningstar research services llc   weve increased our fair value estimate for widemoatrated blackrock to  per share from  after updating our valuation for changes in assets under management revenue and profitability since our last update blackrock closed out the june quarter with a record  trillion in managed assets this was about  billion higher than our forecast with more than  billion of the difference due to more favorable currency exchange another  billion coming from stronger active institutional index and ishares flows and the remainder due to greater market gains than we were forecastinglongterm net inflows of  billion were similar to results from the first quarter of  and the fourth quarter of  when blackrock recorded  billion and  billion in total longterm inflows respectively while ishares remains the largest driver of blackrocks inflows picking up another  billion in aum during the second quarter the firm also saw positive flows from its retail  billion and institutional  billion platforms blackrocks organic growth rate of  over the past four calendar quarters was comfortably above managements annual target rate of  we now expect organic growth of  for the full year compared with  previouslymuch like we saw during the first quarter blackrock turned  average aum growth in the second quarter into  revenue growth as mix shift and fee compression weighed on the firms top line revenue growth of  through the first six months of  is right in line with our forecast for mid to highsingledigit revenue growth for the full year with regards to profitability blackrock reported a basispoint increase in adjusted operating margins to  of revenue when compared with the first half of  we expect fullyear adjusted operating margins of  with the firms free cash flow approaching  billionlooking more closely at the firms fund flows blackrocks ability to put together three straight quarters with inflows in excess of  billion speaks to the strength and diversification of its operations total equity inflows of  billion during the second quarter were driven by the firms ishares  billion operations active equities remain in net outflow mode with another  billion flowing out during the period and institutional equity index portfolios saw  billion in outflows given the meaningfully higher fees blackrock charges for its active equity operations of  basis points relative to  basis points for ishares equity offerings and  basis points for institutional index funds the firm would go a long way toward enhancing organic aum and revenue growth if it ever got the performance of its actively managed funds back on track blackrock closed out the june quarter with   and  of their fundamental equity funds above the benchmark or peer median on a   and year basis respectively which was much better than what we saw at the end of the march quarter that said we believe it is more prudent to stay conservative on any sort of recovery especially with active asset managers fees and performance under a much larger microscope than theyve even been before following in the aftermath of the department of labors fiduciary ruleblackrocks fixedincome platform shrugged off the dual headwinds of a rising us stock market and rising rates with the federal reserve increasing the federalfunds rate near the end of both the march and june quarters this year posting  billion in inflows during the second quarter flows were driven primarily by ishares  billion and the firms institutional index  billion operations with positive flows from its actively managed fixedincome operations of  billion being an added bonus at the end of the march quarter   and  of blackrocks actively managed taxable bond funds were beating their benchmark or peer medians on a   and year basis respectively while   and  of taxexempt offerings were doing the same we expect ishares fixedincome operations to continue to be the more consistent and substantial organic growth vehicle for blackrock the  billion of net inflows produced by the etf platform during the past year was reflective of a  organic growth rate while the company continues to battle vanguard for etf flows the two firms are still capturing more than two thirds of industrys inflows which has allowed ishares to maintain its market share at  the past five years while vanguards has risen from  to based on our current forecasts for the firm we see blackrock generating close to  billion in free cash flow this year the company remains committed to buying back  million of its common stock each quarter which it did again during the second quarter of  as we noted last period the company increased its quarterly dividend to  per share reflective of a  increase in the dividend and based on our updated earnings estimate for  the payout ratio for the companys  per share quarterly dividend is around within managements targeted range of with the current yield being  blackrock is

offsetting generic gleevec pressureby damien conover cfa  morningstar research services llc   novartis posted secondquarter results largely in line with our and consensus expectations and we dont expect any major changes to our fair value estimate we continue to view the stock as modestly undervalued despite the increasing generic pressure on the branded drug segment a strong pipeline gives us confidence in novartis wide moatin the quarter new product launches helped offset generic competition leading to flat operational sales growth which we expect will continue through  followed by a return to growth in  of  generic gleevec caused the majority of the headwinds in the quarter and we expect this pressure will subside in  as the patent loss annualizes importantly the companys

posting steady gains in particular immunology drug cosentyx and cardiovascular drug entresto are together already contributing close to  of the top line and we expect this to grow to over  by  based on efficacy advantages over competitive drugs looking ahead at the latestage pipeline we are bullish on ophthalmology drug rth based on superior dosing but the filing isnt expected until the second half of outside the branded drug group the remaining divisions of sandoz generics and alcon eye care are weighing on results with operating income in both groups down  operationally year over year at sandoz increasing competition in the united states is dragging down pricing but we expect the strong position in biosimilars should return the group to growth in  for alcon heavy reinvestment should

gross revenue due primarily to a delay in boosting these payments to customers in europe we dont read too much into quarterly changes in rebates and incentives payments instead preferring to focus on longterm trends we do think that customers will continue to demand a larger share of payment economics but expect changes to be gradual and manageable management indicated that the companys ancillary offerings are becoming increasingly attractive to smaller issuers that may not have the same technical capabilities as the largest banks we dont explicitly forecast much additional revenue from

source of additional transaction volume for visapolitical reality too much for gop healthcare overhaul mixed impact for our healthcare coverageby vishnu lekraj  morningstar research services llc  the political reality of scaling back healthcare coverage for millions of constituents was too much for the us senate gop to overcome in passing a major overhaul of the affordable care act with the loss of more than two “yes” votes for both the initial and revised senate republican plan senate majority leadership was unable to push a measure that would be appealing to both the moderate and libertarian wings of its caucus thus we believe the probability of a substantive “repeal and replace” plan becoming law is now extremely low on balance we find this development positive for both the managed care and hospital sectors as volume increases due to expanded coverage will remain in place on the other end of the spectrum the elimination of various aca fees and taxes for pharmaceutical and device companies is now off the table even though this development maintains a status quo operating environment it does take away a potential positive financial impact for these firmsfrom here we believe the senate will take a step toward shoring up a weak public exchange marketplace in order to maintain a functioning private individual insurance market over the near term this will likely require some meaningful level of bipartisan negotiation in both chambers of congress despite the rhetoric of letting these marketplaces fail we believe it will be politically untenable for republicans to allow this scenario to playout given they control every branch of the federal government and a significant percentage of affected voting districts are either republican or tossup leaning additionally we believe congressional gop leadership is keen to move on from the political minefield of healthcare legislation and toward initiating a major overhaul of us tax codebottom line we believe the aca will likely remain in place for some time to come and its dominant affect upon healthcarerelated firms will continue however we also believe there will need to be legislation to address longterm issues and concerns related to certain aspects of the law chiefly lawmakers will have to formulate a longterm plan to stabilize the public exchangeindividual markets which comprise approximately a quarter of the private insurance space in order to keep premium costs in check incentivize robust health insurance company participation and prevent a deathspiral scenario from

find an advisor contact us client login checklist  questions every advisor should be able to answer whatever your priorities this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life at one time or another we all face major turning points in our lives—getting married becoming a parent receiving a lifechanging promotion getting ready to retire at times like these many people feel a need for financial help and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense thats when the search begins the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future someone wholl be there for you for years to come and who can provide more than just stock recommendations to find an advisor who can help you with those decisions dont be afraid to ask the following tough questions—theyll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you  what types of clients do you work with some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession others might have particular knowledge in a specialty such as sustainable investing or retirement planning ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs the challenge is finding someone youll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family your money your hopes for your future  what is your track record no advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance and beware those who do but an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty  how often will we talk an advisor should be committed to conversations in person by phone or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require every client has different needs and expectations be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances  how realistic are my goals even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances timelines and investing preferences more insights wondering what its like to work with an advisor tune in to a candid conversation on “the value of advice” watch the webcast  how will we keep my strategy on course even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change an advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift  what happens if the markets are volatile will you call me when markets get scary theres nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone one of an advisors most vital functions is to reach out at such times hear your concerns offer perspective and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy  what if im upset about a service issue or an investment as life becomes increasingly automated theres nothing like a human voice and quick response when youre concerned about a financial matter advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues  who will i actually be working with many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide ask who youd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience beyond the immediate team does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources  how do i pay you for your work its never easy to ask but the right advisors will welcome this question clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences what can an advisor do for you watch making the leap to see how one couple – with the help of their advisor – built a business while keeping their retirement goals in sight

entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are not personally liable for business debts like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc has operating flexibility and is a passthrough entity for tax purposes this means the llcs profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the llc what legal documents do i need to form an llc to create an llc articles of organization must be filed with the secretary of state or appropriate state agency next the llc members should enter into an

the llc and is similar to a director of a corporation a manager can also be a member does an llc have to hold meetings the answer is usually no unless the llcs operating agreement requires meetings
