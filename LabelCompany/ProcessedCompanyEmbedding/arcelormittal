share on home what we do steel products a leader across all market segments main content steel products in  arcelormittal produced nearly  million tons of raw steel in the united states our principal products include a broad range of flat long and tubular products to serve the automotive construction energy appliance container and machinery markets more than  percent of arcelormittal’s raw steel production in the us is from flat operations which are primarily integrated facilities all of our products are available in standard carbon grades as well as highstrength lowalloy grades for more demanding applications flat products hotrolled all coiled flatrolled steel is initially hotrolled by passing a slab through a multistand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than ⁄ inch hotrolled steel destined for the sheet market can be either shipped as black band or cleaned in an acid bath and sold as pickled band these products are used in noncritical surface applications such as automotive frames and wheels construction products pipe offhighway equipment and guardrails coldrolled coldrolled sheet is hotrolled coil that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel further processing through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves ductility and formability coldrolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures coldrolled sheet is used in among other things steel applications that demand higher surface quality such as exposed automobile and appliance panels coldrolled sheet prices are usually higher than hotrolled steel prices for certain applications coldrolled sheet is coated or painted coated either hotrolled or coldrolled coil may be coated with zinc aluminum or a combination thereof to render it corrosion resistant hotdip galvanized galvannealed galvalume electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steel these are also among the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and usually have the strictest quality requirements coated steel products are generally used in applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings and grain bins plate plate is steel that is generally more than ⁄ inch thick it can be made on either a coiled plate mill up to oneinch thick or a discrete plate mill the coiled plate or discrete plate is then cut into sections for specific end uses commodity steel plate is used in a variety of applications such as storage tanks ships and railcars large diameter pipe and machinery parts more specialized steel plate such as highstrength lowalloy heattreated or alloy plate can have superior strength and performance characteristics for particular applications such as the manufacture of construction mining and logging equipment pressure vessels and oil and gas transmission lines and the fabrication of bridges and buildings quenched and tempered plate is harder and stronger and can be used in products such as military armor and hard rock mining equipment tin tin mill sheet steel is used to produce food packaging and other containers it is available as black plate tin plate and tinfree steel black plate is an uncoated thin gauge coldrolled steel tin plate is black plate electrolytically plated with metallic tin and tinfree steel is black plate that has been electrolytically plated with metallic chromium and chromium oxides both tin plate and tinfree steel undergo a plating process whereby the molecules from the positively charged tin or chromium anode attach to the negatively charged sheet steel the thickness of the coating is readily controlled through regulation of the voltage and speed of the sheet through the plating area long products rail billets and blooms are fed through rollers that form rail rail is produced in a number of sections determined by their weight per yard and relative strengths rail is sold to railroad companies and regional transit authorities for new track projects and for the repair of existing track tubular products specialty steel tubing apart from welded and seamless steel tubes available in a wide spectrum of carbon and alloy grades tubular product solutions can also be tailored to meet the specific needs of customers through an extensive range of services including cutting end finishing heat treating and steel slitting there are also drawnovermandrel dom and cold drawing capabilities available for the most demanding applications tubular products serve a variety of markets including automotive industrial and construction equipment hydraulic cylinders agricultural equipment and mineral mining equipment welded products tailor blanks tailored blanks play a significant role in providing “tailor made” solutions to automotive customers a tailored blank which can be a straight line or curvilinear product is created by laser welding together steels of various grades thicknesses andor different coatings tailored blanks help improve the performance of car parts in a vehicle while reducing weight and enhancing safety

production in the us is from flat operations which are primarily integrated facilities all of our products are available in standard carbon grades as well as highstrength lowalloy grades for more demanding applications flat products hotrolled all coiled flatrolled steel is initially hotrolled by passing a slab through a multistand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than ⁄ inch hotrolled steel destined for the sheet market can be either shipped as black band or cleaned in an acid bath and sold as pickled band these products are used in noncritical surface applications such as automotive frames and wheels construction products pipe offhighway equipment and guardrails coldrolled coldrolled sheet is hotrolled coil that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge or thickness and other physical properties have been achieved coldrolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel further processing through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves ductility and formability coldrolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures coldrolled sheet is used in among other things steel applications that demand higher surface quality such as exposed automobile and appliance panels coldrolled sheet prices are usually higher than hotrolled steel prices for certain applications coldrolled sheet is coated or painted coated either hotrolled or coldrolled coil may be coated with zinc aluminum or a combination thereof to render it corrosion resistant hotdip galvanized galvannealed galvalume electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steel these are also among the highest valueadded sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and usually have the strictest quality requirements coated steel products are generally used in applications such as automobiles household appliances roofing and siding heating and air conditioning equipment air ducts switch boxes chimney flues awnings and grain bins plate plate is steel that is generally more than ⁄ inch thick it can be made on either a coiled plate mill up to oneinch thick or a discrete plate mill the coiled plate or discrete plate is then cut into sections for specific end uses commodity steel plate is used in a variety of applications such as storage tanks ships and railcars large diameter pipe and machinery parts more specialized steel plate such as highstrength lowalloy heattreated or alloy plate can have superior strength and performance characteristics for particular applications such as the manufacture of construction mining and logging equipment pressure vessels and oil and gas transmission lines and the fabrication of bridges and buildings quenched and tempered plate is harder and stronger and can be used in products such as military armor and hard rock mining equipment tin tin mill sheet steel is used to produce food packaging and other containers it is available as black plate tin plate and tinfree steel black plate is an uncoated thin gauge coldrolled steel tin plate is black plate electrolytically plated with metallic tin and tinfree steel is black plate that has been electrolytically plated with metallic chromium and chromium oxides both tin plate and tinfree steel undergo a plating process whereby the molecules from the positively charged tin or chromium anode attach to the negatively charged sheet steel the thickness of the coating is readily controlled through regulation of the voltage and speed of the sheet through the plating area long products rail billets and blooms are fed through rollers that form rail rail is produced in a number of sections determined by their weight per yard and relative strengths rail is sold to railroad companies and regional transit authorities for new track projects and for the repair of existing track tubular products specialty steel tubing apart from welded and seamless steel tubes available in a wide spectrum of carbon and alloy grades tubular product solutions can also be tailored to meet the specific needs of customers through an extensive range of services including cutting end finishing heat treating and steel slitting there are also drawnovermandrel dom and cold drawing capabilities available for the most demanding applications tubular products serve a variety of markets including automotive industrial and construction equipment hydraulic cylinders agricultural equipment and mineral mining equipment welded products tailor blanks tailored blanks play a significant role in providing “tailor made” solutions to automotive customers a tailored blank which can be a straight line or curvilinear product is created by laser

bookmark b share on ftin home what we do steel byproduct sales using resources judiciously byproduct sales using the byproducts generated during the steelmaking process makes good business sense as well as reducing the environmental impact we try to use all the materials produced during the process of steelmaking whether they are prime steel products or materials commonly seen as waste arcelormittal’s shared services team coordinates sales of byproducts from the steelmaking process with the aim of generating revenue from these products as well as making good business sense making the most of the byproducts of steelmaking is the right thing to do in terms of material stewardship by recycling as much as possible and minimising the impact of steelmaking on the environment through their work on byproducts the shared services team drives collaboration between arcelormittal’s mills and customers byproducts include all forms of slag from both integrated and mini mills in granulated or ground form tar and tar distillates benzole ammonium sulphate mill scales and sludges coke breeze and various dusts collected throughout the various steel production stages we also operate a number of slag dumps which were accumulated before arcelormittal owned various steel plants these may be rich in iron and carbonbearing materials and can be reused in our steelmaking facilities this lowers the need to buy materials reducing the company’s external material and supply chain footprint related information recycling our waste arcelormittal tubarão has an inventive

product offeringarcelormittal’s extensive product offering includes a martinsite® line with tensile strengths ranging from  mpa to  mpa which helps today’s automakers shed weight from simpler shapes that can be manufactured by roll forming usibor® a press hardened steel grade supports weight reduction in more advanced shapes that require higher tensile strength and sin motion offers weight reduction solutions for  key vehicle parts for the front side and rear body structure plus additional solutions for hangon doors chassis and exhaust parts our offer commercial steelcstypically produced using low carbon content cs is used in applications with more limited forming requirementsdrawing steelds ds is a readily available specification which offers good formability ds is aluminum killed and typically has lower carbon or controlled processing resulting in improved formabilitydeep drawing steelddsa specification of steel with excellent formability characteristics which is recommended for difficult forming applications dds is also available in standard and extra low carbon forms it is sometimes produced using ultra low carbon ulc or interstitial free if steelsextra deep drawing steeleddsa highly formable specification of steel ideal for the most difficult forming applications where other steels lack sufficient ductility this product is produced using if steel requiring the use of a degasser in steelmaking as well as close control of alloy additionsbake hardenablebhthese specifications are unique in that they are designed to increase yield strength after the paint curing process providing the benefit of both superior formability over traditional high strength steels and higher part strength than previously described specifications they acquire their added strength via the amount of strain generated in the part during stamping and through the time and temperature inherent in the paint curing processhigh strength low alloyhslahsla specifications offer higher strengths for applications where forming requirements are not as severe as previously described specifications the product is sold to guaranteed mechanical properties of yield strength tensile strength and elongation the strength is obtained not only through carbon and manganese but also through the addition of one or more microalloys cb ti v coupled with controlled processingcarbon manganesecmncarbon steels containing more than  percent up to approximately  percent manganese are referred to as carbon manganese steels the manganese content in carbon steels is increased for the purpose of increasing depth of hardening and improving strength and toughnessdual phasedpdp steels offer an outstanding combination of strength and initial drawability as a result of their microstructure in which a hard martensitic or bainitic phase is dispersed in a soft ferritic phase these steels have high strain hardening capacity as a result finished part mechanical properties especially yield strength are superior to those of the initial blank these steels have excellent fatigue strength and good energy absorption capacity making them suitable for use in structural parts and reinforcementstransformation induced plasticity steelstriptrip steels offer an outstanding combination of strength and ductility as a result of their microstructure they are suitable for structural and reinforcement parts of complex shape the microstructure of these steels is composed of islands of hard residual austenite and carbidefree bainite dispersed in a soft ferritic matrix austenite is transformed into martensite during plastic deformation making it possible to achieve greater initial elongations high strain hardening capacity and high mechanical strengths lend these steels excellent energy absorption capacity trip steels also exhibit a strong bake hardening effect following deformation which further improves their crash performance trip steels are particularly well suited for automotive structural and safety parts such as cross members longitudinal beams bpillar reinforcements sills and bumper reinforcementspress hardened steel  usibor®phs – usibor®phs are designed to be heat treated and then quenched during the hot stamping process the mechanical properties of the final part make significant weight savings possible the very high yield strength of these steels after heat treatment and hot stamping make them suitable for antiintrusion components such as fender beams door reinforcements and bpillars usibor® has an aluminumsilicon precoating and was developed to protect the metal from oxidation scale and decarburization during the hot stamping process the coating offers excellent resistance to oxidation resulting from the hot stamping heat treatment process final parts using this forming technology have improved corrosion resistance after paintingmartensitic steelsmartarcelormittal’s martinsite® ultra high strength steels consist of fully martensitic microstructures offering some of the highest strength levels available in the marketplace these steels offer much higher strengthtoweight ratios than conventional cold rolled steels although limited in formability alternative available manufacturing technologies such as rollforming are used to fabricate these grades typical applications for martinsite® gradesmild steelsproduct characteristics arcelormittal offers a wide range of mild steels depending on the formability requirements the appropriate sheet steel grade may be selected steel grades range from commercial steel cs which have the reasonable formability to grades like extra deep drawing steel plus edds plus which offers superior formability all of these grades are low carbon grades some of the highly formable steels contain ultralow levels of carbon and are fully stabilized with microalloying elements like titanium andor niobium these steels are also commonly known as interstitialfree steels ie these steels have no free interstitially available carbon or nitrogen application these steels are the most widely used grades in the automotive industry they offer excellent formability and can be used for a range of parts from simple small brackets to complicated shapes like wheelhouses and floorpans the lower strength of these steels can limit their applications where dent resistance durability and high strength requirements are essential these grades have excellent manufacturability and can be easily joined using conventional welding techniques
