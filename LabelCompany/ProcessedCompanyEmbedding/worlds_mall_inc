our ability to continue as a going concern the company had a deficit accumulated since inception and a net loss and net cash used in operating activities since inception results of operations  fiscal year ended december   and  no revenue has been generated by the company since inception the companys financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern the company has a minimum cash balance available for payment of ongoing operating expenses has experienced losses from operations and it does not have a source of revenue its continued existence is dependent upon its ability to continue to execute its operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing there can be no assurance the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the company our operating expenses for the year ended december   were  compared to operating expenses of  for the year ended december   the significant increase is primarily attributed to the increase of professional fees and general and administrative expenses in  the companys net loss for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december   the significant increase is primarily attributed to the increase of the

be able to implement its plan of operations the company also does not have sufficient cash to continue for the next twelve months going concern our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business as reflected in the financial statements we had an accumulated deficit at december   a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our cash position is not sufficient to support its daily operations while we believe in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further

note   organization and operations   worlds mall inc   worlds mall inc the “company” was incorporated on march   under the laws of the state of nevada the company plans to develop an ecommerce website that will connect retail stores with customers around the world   note   significant and critical accounting policies and practices   the management of the company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain the company’s significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles   basis of presentation – unaudited interim financial information   the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” for the interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are in the opinion of management necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the company for the year ended december   and notes thereto contained in the company’s annual report on form k filed with the sec on june     use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were     i assumption as a going concern  management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business     ii valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  management assumes that the realization of the company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss “nol” carry–forwards for federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are offset by a full valuation allowance management made this assumption based on a the company has incurred recurring losses b general economic conditions d its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering among other factors   these significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value     f        management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification “paragraph ” to measure the fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below   level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument   the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of this instrument   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated   cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents   related parties   the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions   pursuant to section  the related parties include a affiliates of the company “affiliate” means with respect to any specified person any other person that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls is controlled by or is under common control with such person as such terms are used in and construed under rule  under the securities act b entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required absent the election of the fair value option under the fair value option subsection of section –– to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity c trusts for the benefit of employees such as pension and profitsharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management d principal owners of the company e management of the company f other parties with which the company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests and g other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests     f        the financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions other than compensation arrangements expense allowances and other similar items in the ordinary course of business however disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements the disclosures shall include a the nature of the relationships involved b a description of the transactions including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements c the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period and d amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and if not otherwise apparent the terms and manner of settlement   commitment and contingencies   the company follows subtopic  of the fasb accounting standards codification to report accounting for contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the company’s financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability and an estimate of the range of possible losses if determinable and material would be disclosed   loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantees would be disclosed   revenue recognition   the company follows paragraph s of the fasb accounting standards codification for revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned the company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured   deferred tax assets and income tax provision   the company accounts for income taxes under section  of the fasb accounting standards codification deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date   the company adopted section  of the fasb accounting standards codification “section ” section  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures   the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets as well as tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards the company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary     f        management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability in addition the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years if actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary   tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions   the company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the asc paragraph    earnings per share   earnings per share eps is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock for convenience the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share eps is computed pursuant to section  of the fasb accounting standards codification pursuant to asc paragraphs  through  basic eps shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders the numerator by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding the denominator during the period income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock whether or not paid and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock whether or not earned from income from continuing operations if that amount appears in the income statement and also from net income the computation of diluted eps is similar to the computation of basic eps except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement stock options or warrants   pursuant to asc paragraphs  through  diluted eps shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder the dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants and their equivalents issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted eps by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs  through  and  through  require that another method be applied equivalents of options and warrants include nonvested stock granted to employees stock purchase contracts and partially paid stock subscriptions see paragraph ––– antidilutive contracts such as purchased put options and purchased call options shall be excluded from diluted eps under the treasury stock method a exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period or at time of issuance if later and common shares shall be assumed to be issued b the proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period see paragraphs  and  through  c the incremental shares the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased shall be included in the denominator of the diluted eps computation   there were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the reporting period ended march   and    cash flows reporting   the company adopted paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for cash flows reporting classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating investing or financing activities and provides definitions of each

will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to the company   we incurred  in expenses from professional fees for the three months ended june   compared to  for the three months ended

its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company if continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms the company may not be able to implement its plan of operations   going concern   our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as of june   we have not generated any revenues since inception  we expect to finance our operations primarily through our existing cash our operations and any future financing  however there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we will be required to obtain additional capital in the future to continue our operations and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital through equity or debt financing or any combination thereof or on satisfactory terms or at all additionally no assurance can be given that any such financing if obtained will be adequate to meet our capital needs if adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms our operations would be materially negatively impacted therefore our auditor has substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to complete additional offerings is dependent on the state of the debt andor equity markets at the time of any proposed offering and such market’s reception of the company and the offering

they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by us gaap for complete financial statements the unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals which are in the opinion of management necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented unaudited interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   and notes thereto contained in the our annual report on form k filed with the sec on april                 cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less

and earned when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collectability is reasonably assured   fair value of financial instruments   the company follows paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph  of the fasb accounting standards codification “paragraph ” to measure the fair value of its financial instruments paragraph  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures paragraph  establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three  broad levels the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs the three  levels of fair value hierarchy defined by paragraph  are described below   level    quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date       level    pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data   financial assets are considered level  when their fair values are determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable   the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs if the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument            the carrying amounts of the company’s financial assets and liabilities such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of this instrument   transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an armslength basis as the requisite conditions of competitive freemarket dealings may not exist representations about transactions with related parties if made shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in armslength transactions unless such representations can be substantiated       use of estimates and assumptions and critical accounting estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   critical accounting estimates are estimates for which a the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and b the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material the company’s critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were   i assumption as a going concern  management assumes that the company will continue as a going concern which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business   ii valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  management assumes that the realization of the company’s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss “nol” carry–forwards for federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly the potential tax benefits of the net loss carryforwards are offset by a full valuation allowance management made this assumption based on a the company has incurred recurring losses b general economic conditions d its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering among other factors   these significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value   management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources   management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information changes in facts and circumstances historical experience and reasonable assumptions after such evaluations if deemed appropriate those estimates are adjusted accordingly   actual results could differ from those estimates   recent accounting pronouncements   accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by fasb that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption            off balance sheet arrangements   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition sales or expenses results of operations liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to an investment in our securities   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company   item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   pursuant to rule ab under the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” the company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” the company’s principal financial and accounting officer of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined under rule ae under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the company’s ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and

processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the company’s ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reason described below   because of our limited operations we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties in addition we lack a formal audit committee with a financial expert as we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts as needed however there can be no assurance that our operations will expand     changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial
