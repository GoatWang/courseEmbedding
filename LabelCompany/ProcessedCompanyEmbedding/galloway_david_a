communicationsi highly suggest this read as it was put together mainly by jean plumez authors david gallowaycarl jung and isabel briggsmyers testenfj representing approximately  people those with enfj personality type tend to be very influential often without making any conscious efforts to increase their influence enfjs are interested in other people  radiate authenticity concern  altruism those who surround the enfj usually find them very inspiring and likeable enfjs are very charismatic  eloquent finding it natural and easy to communicate their ideas  opinions especially in person it does not really matter whether they are presenting cold facts or expressing raging emotions the enfj will not be afraid to stand up  speak regardless of the audience this is one of the reasons why enfjs can be so convincing  mesmerizing when they speak they instinctively know how to combine passion  rational arguments drawing the audience’s attention  reaching every mind people with this personality type can be great leaders  they do not necessarily have to get into politics to make a difference an enfj teacher or a coach can have a strong positive effect on many people’s lives as well enfj personalities are very intuitive they find it easy to sense other people’s motives  find connections between seemingly unrelated events enfjs also tend to be quite good at analyzing their own feelings  questioning them if necessary on the other hand such intuitiveness  sensitivity can also cause significant difficulties for people with this personality type they may be too altruistic  empathic getting too involved in other people’s problems then finding it difficult to detach  stop worrying in extreme cases this can even affect the enfjs’ perception of themselves enfjs are optimistic idealists often trusting other people more than they should although this usually turns out to be a selffulfilling prophecy as already mentioned above enfjs can be very convincing  inspiring people are drawn towards strong personalities  the enfj’s charisma can often be a uniting and motivating factorauthors david gallowayskillsproduct managementaccount managementkey account

million other professionals are on linkedinview david’s full profilesummaryi have a bsc in chemistry followed by a self funded postgraduate masters in analytical chemistry this has given me a strong base to move forward and attain the goals and dreams that i have i consider myself to be an analytically minded person with strong hands on abilities i like to be challenged in life and feel a drive to do the best i can in any situation after my studies i immediately got a job at severn trent services in a microbiology lab this was very different to the training i have received at university and required a steep learning curve within a short time i had got to the stage of setting up in the morning and even training new members of staff i then moved to eli lilly in surrey where i started a completely different challenge myself and one other colleague setup a pilot laboratory to purify target compound with limited training from a colleague in the us running a similar service the laboratory was constantly evolving where ideas to improve the service were implemented i then moved back to the midlands where i started at biffa as a site chemist on a hazardous waste treatment plant this was more in line with what trained to do my primary job was to analysis waste that could be treated in the plant to ensure it was compatible this was then compared to the waste once it arrived on
