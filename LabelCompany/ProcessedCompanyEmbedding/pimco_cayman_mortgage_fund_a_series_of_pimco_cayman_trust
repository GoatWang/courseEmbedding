investors who own pimcos real return commodity fund pcrax pcrix think they are investing in a commodity futures fund turns out they are investing in a leveraged hybrid bondcommodity fund not a very good option for investors who are seeking commodity exposure in order to diversify their portfolios and now its starting to bitelast month the largest commodities fund in the world the pimco commodity real return strategy fund fell more than  percent while the worstperforming broad commodities etf fell slightly more than  percent what givesa quick look at the holdings list of pcrax confirms this as of march  pcrax held everything from bear sterns adjustable rate mortgage trusts to petrobras corporate debt to mexican sovereign bonds in fact the bulk of the fund’s  billion asset tally is invested in tips and the portfolio has an effective maturity and duration of six and  years respectivelyall of this is to say that pcrax like many strategies that provide this type of collateral optimization are leveraged products that aren’t labeled as suchwhy then doesn’t anyone call pcrax a leveraged fund when it’s clear the collateral in the portfolio is exposed to everything from default risk to geopolitical risk considering that most people use commodities and the products that aggregate them as a means to diversify away from credit and equity exposure why would they want to invite these risks into the commodity portion of their portfolioshttpwwwindexuniversecomhottopicsinvestingincommoditieswithoutleveragehtml we dont know where we are or where were going  but were making good time

investment strategy top johnninielsen posts  joined mon oct    am re pimcos commodity fund is not really a commodity fund quote postby johnninielsen » thu jun    pm any commodity fund of the total return type will have to utilise some form of collateral for the futures that provide the underlying commodity exposure usually the funds use shortterm treasuries but pimco has tried to boost the yield from this collateral by taking more duration and credit risk and it backfired this timepersonally i like this enhancement and think it will be a valueadded longrun but also have difficulty understanding why a company like pimco who also provide tail hedging expertise was not on top of thisthere are likely more to the story than we know top larryswedroe posts  joined thu feb    am

repeated in the pressleverage means borrowing money to increase the investment in the asset in this case would be to over  like the rydex funds dothe only difference here is that pimco chooses not to invest the collateral in three month bills which is the index benchmarkinstead they actively manage the collateral with large amounts in tips and then some in diversified positions in riskier assets but there is no leveragelarry top assetchaos posts  joined tue feb    pm location melbourne re pimcos commodity fund is not really a commodity fund quote postby assetchaos » thu jun    pm i read the same article the other day the author uses the word leverage in a very funny and i would consider nonstandardeven misleadingmanner this fund takes the collateral and instead of investing it in tbills as the index assumes invests it in bonds with longer term mostly intermediate tips and has a bit of bonds with extra credit risk over treasuries so the collateral is invested with a higher risk profile than tbills i think the articles author is trying to say that this higher risk profile is equivilent to leveraging a portfolio of tbills until it has higher risk that may be true in some technical sense but it seems quite odd to equate term risk with leverage and the author doesnt explain what he actually means he spouts the word leverage even though the fund clearly says it does no borrowing i consider it a rather poorly written article thats trying to put a scary slant on something innocuous in order to drum up interest if hed wanted to say commodities are risky or that term risk is real he could have just said that regards   guy top browser posts  joined wed sep    pm re pimcos commodity fund is not really a commodity fund quote postby browser » thu jun    pm heres how the article defines leverageit’s therefore a matter of perception and how one defines leverage when you hold a commodity etf the requirement is that all cash collateral be invested in cash or cash equivalentsany departure from this by definition represents the introduction of leverage meanwhile pcrax invests  percent of its portfolio’s collateral in a wide range of debt instruments none of which expires less than a year from nowthe author feels that an unleveraged position in commodity futures is defined as holding the collateral in riskless cash eg month treasury bills as i understand it if you use that collateral to invest in riskier assets you are actually leveraging the cash by effectively borrowing it from riskless collateral to invest it in something else that is more risky in any event investors should understand that these pimco funds are not pure commodity futures funds they are funds that invest in commodity futures bonds currencies and other assets there is a much higher correlation between the returns of the pimco funds and bond returns than there is for pure or unleveraged commodity funds and etfs many investors wish to include commodity futures in their investment portfolios because of the relatively low correlation of their returns to the returns of stocks and bonds and they want to have a relatively precise idea of what percentage of their portfolio is allocated to commodity futures per se the pimco funds are not wellsuited to this strategy we dont know where we are or where were going  but were making good time top nisiprius advisory

authors own response to question about leveragewhile i agree with your assertion that investors understand the term leverage to describe a fund that borrows money to enhance returns the fact that pcraxs cash collateral is being invested in assets some riskier than others other than cash with the aim of enhancing returns should at least make one reconsider how they define the term leverage that was the goal of the article after a month where pcrax fell twice as much as the most widely followed commodities indexes i felt the question worth asking it is the largest commodities fund on earth

treasuriesif an investor in fund a wanted to replicate the return of fund b he would have to borrow money on margin and invest the borrowed money in long term treasuries thats leverage right so it

fund is not really a commodity fund quote postby am » fri jun    am can someone correct me if i am wrong this fund follows an index to invest in commodity futures so proportions of commodities it invests in are fairly constant it uses active management to select months to roll contracts to avoid common problems uses active management to invest collateral which can be anything or is limited to bonds of all varieties top browser posts  joined wed sep    pm re pimcos commodity fund is not really a commodity fund quote postby browser » fri jun    am i think the author is pointing out that funds often adopt the practice of investing in riskier securities because they are constrained from using leverage to boost returns i dont know where i heard that maybe here security risk is used as a proxy for leverage thats what pimco is effectively doing traders in commodity futures only have to put down a portion of the trade and the balance is held in lowrisk collateral to secure the position usually month tbills pimco is investing in riskier collateral in order to boost returns its that simple is it leverage well if it walks like leverage and it quacks like leverage i personally think that if an investor wants to invest in commodity futures as well as other securities such as tips they should do it via separate holdings so they know exactly whats going on we dont know where we are

commodity fund of the total return type will have to utilise some form of collateral for the futures that provide the underlying commodity exposure usually the funds use shortterm treasuries but pimco has tried to boost the yield from this collateral by taking more duration and credit risk and it backfired this timepersonally i like this enhancement and think it will be a valueadded longrun but

securities and the use of whenissued delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions or derivative instruments may give rise to leverage causing the fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveragedclicking around the pimco websites description doesnt really tell me anything about whether it engages in leverage and doesnt say whether or not it is fully collateralized the fact sheet says the fund actively manages the the exposure to commodity futures and collateralizes these positions with an actively managed portfolio of tips i dont know whether collateralizes is generally understood to mean fully collateralizes is iti clicked around through various monthly market reports and fund overviews and annual reports to see if it said anything relevant but didnt find anything the annual report mentions some specific holdings as collateralizing or being collateralized by others but i dont see my own way to figuring out whether things are fully collateralizedthe full description of the principal investment strategy is quoted below it doesnt say fully collateralized in so many words but understanding this language is above my pay grade and id appreciate some illuminationis the language below that would tell us that it is fully collateralized and that it is unleveraged except perhaps for occasional anomalies what is meant by the fund will seek to gain

properties such as oil metals and agricultural products the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by overall market movements and other factors affecting the value of a

discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this prospectus the subsidiary unlike the fund may invest without limitation in commoditylinked swap agreements and other commoditylinked derivative

particular commodity index the fund or the subsidiary may overweight or underweight its exposure to a particular commodity index or a subset of commodities such that the fund has greater or lesser exposure to that index than the value of the funds net assets or greater or lesser exposure to a subset of commodities than is represented by a particular commodity index such deviations will frequently be the result of temporary market fluctuations and under normal circumstances the fund will seek to maintain notional exposure to one or more commodity indices within  plus or minus of the value of the funds net assetsassets not invested in commoditylinked derivative instruments or the subsidiary may be invested in inflationindexed securities and other fixed income instruments including

nisipriusas i have explained in the past the prospectuses are written to give the fund great flexibility typically far more than expected to be used by a passive fund the reason this is the case is that they dont want to have to get permission to do something if an unusual market condition occurs and the action is not already in the prospectus dfa does this all the time never intending to do much of what is in the prospectus its just a fact of life in the businessyou can trust me or not but i assure you there is no leverage used in the fund in the traditional sense of the word nor does the fund actively manage its commodities exposure meaning it doesnt overweight wheat or underweight gold and so on their active management is limited to the actions i have described and the same for

using to decide whether to invest in the fund and im nibbling away on trying to learn how to decode itif the truth is that the public fund information doesnt actually disclose enough for a retail

nispriusyes its unfortunate but its the way it is because of sec rulesso fund families have to make the prospectuses so broad that they can often become meaningless in telling you want the fund really does otherwise they might be forced into expensive actions to address unique market situations and each time they want to change something they would have to go back and get shareholder approval which takes time and money that is why we insist on what is called an attribution analysis from the fund families we work with whenever there is significant deviation from the benchmark returns we want to see what caused the deviationif its random events like perhaps a sector outperforms and we dont care about sectors and that sector is underweighted in the fund relative to an index then thats fine example is say reits outperform value stocks than dfa value funds which dont include reits because they are treated as separate asset class then that is fine with pimco we became very concerned when the tracking error became very large and it was caused by the collateral management and the collateral taking more credit risk than we expected based on what we were told we thought the vast majority would be in tips and very little in credit type productswith dfa we get an explanation of how their not using the five index roll dates impacts returns on how their use of the non front month impacts returnsjust as an examplebut we get this type analysis on all the funds we invest client assets in to make sure we understand what is happening and to make sure the fund is doing what it is supposed

maintain some lquid cash and hold some assets as collateral i can sympathize that a fund has to write its prospectus broadly to avoid violating its self imposed restrictions when it takes an action in support of the stated goals of the fund it also makes sense that nonsynchronous trading may create fleeting arbitrage opportunities to invest in instruments that are components of the index they might do this not because they think that wheat is cheap for example but because a particular wheat contract or derivative is cheap compared to the index as a whole or to some other wheat derivative at the

returns to its commodity fund by taking on additional risk with the collateral they forgot that this multiplies losses as well as gainsin finance leverage sometimes referred to as gearing in the united kingdom and australia is a general term for any technique to multiply gains and lossescommon ways to attain leverage are borrowing money buying fixed assets and using derivatives important examples area public corporation may leverage its equity by borrowing money the more it borrows the less equity capital it needs so any profits or losses are shared among a smaller base and are proportionately larger as a resulta business entity can leverage its revenue by buying fixed assets this will increase the proportion of fixed as opposed to variable costs meaning that a change in revenue will result in a larger change in operating incomehedge funds often leverage their assets by using derivatives a fund might get any gains or losses on  million worth of crude oil by posting
