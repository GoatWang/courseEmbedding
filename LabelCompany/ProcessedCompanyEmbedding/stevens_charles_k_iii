him in a familyowned beach cottage at mokuleia with multiple skull fractures and a broken collarbone shintaku said he believed he had been beaten after he passed out police said he hurt himself in a fall during a botched attempt to hang himself in  shintaku retired from the bench the judge was arrested in a  raid on an alewa heights teahouse in the company of earl kh kim who controlled gambling
