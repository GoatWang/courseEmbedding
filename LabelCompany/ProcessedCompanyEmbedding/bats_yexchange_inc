use the pdf linked in the document sidebar for the official electronic format start preamble december   i introduction on october   bats exchange inc “bats” bats yexchange inc “byx” edga exchange inc “edga” and edgx exchange inc “edgx” collectively the “exchanges” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  “act”  and rule b thereunder proposed rule changes to establish a new market data product called the “bats one feed” on november   each of the exchanges filed an amendment no  to its proposed rule change the proposed rule changes each as amended by an amendment no  were published for comment in the federal register on november   on december   each of the exchanges filed an amendment no  to its proposed rule change on december   each of the exchanges submitted a comment letter on its proposed rule change each of which included a redline showing the changes made by their amendments no  no other comments on the proposed rule changes have been received however similar proposed rule changes were filed with the commission by the exchanges earlier this year and subsequently withdrawn  three start printed page comment letters were received in response to two of those proposed rule changes the commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comment on the amendments no  and to approve each of the proposed rule changes as modified by amendments nos  and  on an accelerated basis ii description of the proposals the exchanges propose to establish a new market data product called the bats one feed which would be offered by each of the exchanges the bats one feed would be a consolidated data feed based on market data derived from underlying data feeds offered by each of the exchanges specifically the exchanges would use the following data feeds which are also available to other vendors to create the proposed bats one feed the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed the exchanges have represented that they will continue to make these individual underlying feeds available and that as a result the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed would be the same as the source available to other vendors as described more fully below the bats one feed would be a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” of all displayed orders for securities traded on the exchanges and for which the exchanges report quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also contain the individual last sale information for each of the exchanges in addition the bats one feed would include messages from the exchanges about trading on their markets finally the bats one feed would contain an optional functionality that would enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated twosided quotations from the exchanges for up to five  price levels description of the bats one feed the bats one feed would contain the aggregate bbo of the exchanges for all securities that are traded on the exchanges and for which the exchanges report quotes under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the aggregate bbo would include the total size of all orders at the bbo available on all exchanges the bats one feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual exchanges the last sale information would include the price size time of execution and the individual exchange on which the trade was executed the last sale message would also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all exchanges for that trading day the exchanges have represented that they would disseminate the aggregate bbo of the exchanges and last sale information through the bats one feed no earlier than each individual exchange provides its bbo and last sale information to the processors under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also include symbol summary market status retail liquidity identifier on behalf of byx trading status and trade break messages the symbol summary message would include the total executed volume across all of the exchanges the market status message would be disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the exchanges for example the market status message would indicate whether one of the exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the bats one feed as part of the aggregated bbo the market status message would also indicate when an exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated bbo the retail liquidity identifier indicator message would be disseminated via the bats one feed on behalf of the byx only pursuant to byxs retail price improvement “rpi” program the retail liquidity identifier indicates when rpi interest priced at least  better than byxs protected bid or protected offer for a particular security is available in the system the exchanges propose to disseminate the retail liquidity indicator via the bats one feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams ie pursuant to the consolidated tape association planconsolidated quotation plan or ctacq for tape a and tape b securities and the nasdaq utp plan for tape c securities as well as through proprietary byx data feeds the retail liquidity identifier reflects the symbol and the side buy or sell of the rpi interest but does not include the price or size of the rpi interest in particular like cq and utp quoting outputs the bats one feed would include a field for codes related to the retail price improvement identifier the codes indicate rpi interest that is priced better than byxs protected bid or protected offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the program the trade break message would indicate when an execution on one of the exchanges has been broken in accordance with the individual exchanges rules the trading status message would indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual exchange for example a trading status message would be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to rule  of regulation sho “short sale circuit breaker” or the security is subject to a trading halt suspension or pause declared by the listing market a trading status message would be sent whenever a securitys trading status changes optional functionality for aggregate depth of book the bats one feed would also offer an additional optional functionality that would enable recipients to receive twosided quotations from the exchanges for five  price levels for all securities that are traded on the exchanges the option for start printed page receiving the bats one feed with this depth of book functionality is referred to as the “bats one premium feed” the option for receiving the bats one feed without this functionality is referred to as the “bats one summary feed” for each price level on one of the exchanges the bats one premium feed option of the bats one feed would include a twosided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level distribution of the bats one feed the exchanges represent that they have taken into consideration their affiliated relationships in the design of the bats one feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchanges both from the perspective of latency and cost the exchanges have stated that they propose to offer the bats one feed voluntarily in response to demand from vendors and subscribers that are interested in receiving the aggregate bbo and last sale information from the exchanges as part of a single data feed the exchanges assert that the bats one feed can be used by industry professionals and retail investors looking for a cost effective easytoadminister high quality market data product with the characteristics of the bats one feed the exchanges also assert that the bats one feed would help protect a free and open market by providing vendors and subscribers additional choices in receiving this type of market data thus promoting competition and innovation with respect to latency the exchanges have represented that the path for distribution by the exchanges of bats one feed would not be faster than the path for distribution that would be used by a vendor to distribute an independently created a bats onelike product accordingly the exchanges have stated the proposed bats one data feed is a data product that a competing vendor could create and sell without being in a disadvantaged position relative to the exchange in recognition that the exchanges are the source of their own market data and affiliated with one another the exchanges have represented that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is available to other vendors specifically the exchanges have represented that they would use the following data feeds to create the proposed bats one feed each of which is available to other vendors the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed the exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available these individual underlying feeds and that as a result the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors the exchanges have also made the following representations regarding the latency of the bats one feed and any consolidated feed to be offered by a competing vendor in order to create the bats one feed the system creating and supporting the bats one feed would need to receive the individual data feeds from each exchange and in turn aggregate and summarize that data to create the bats one feed and then distribute it to end users this is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the bats one feed to distribute to its end users in addition a competing vendor could locate its servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed and could therefore receive the individual data feeds from each exchange at the same time as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed thus the exchanges have stated that they would not have any unfair advantage over competing vendors with respect to obtaining data from the individual exchanges because the technology supporting the bats one feed would similarly need to obtain the underlying data feeds and because this connection would be on a level playing field with a competing vendor located at the same facility as the exchanges likewise the bats one data feed would not have a speed advantage visàvis competing vendors with respect to access to end user customers whether those end users are also located in the same data center or not with regard to cost the exchanges have represented that they will file a separate rule filing with the commission to establish fees for bats one feed and that these fees would be designed to ensure that vendors could compete with the exchanges by creating a similar product to ensure a vendor can compete with the exchanges by creating the same product as the bats one feed and selling it to their clients the exchanges have also represented that they would charge their clients for the bats one feed an amount that is no less than the cost to a market data vendor to obtain all the underlying feeds plus an amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function thus the pricing for the bats one feed would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no pricing disadvantage relative to the exchanges implementation date the exchanges have represented that they anticipate making the bats one feed available as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule changes by the commission and the effectiveness of rule filings to establish the fees for the bats one feed iii summary of comments as noted above the commission received three comment letters on previous versions of the proposed changes filed by some of the exchanges in their current proposals the exchanges have responded to the points raised by these commenters the three commenters generally oppose the proposed bats one feed the shatto letter expressed general concerns about the transparency of order flow information to regulators the themis letter expressed objections to the proposed bats one feed on the grounds that it would introduce a new proprietary data feed and expressed concerns generally about the complexity arising from the proliferation of new data technologies in their response to the commenters the exchanges argued that the themis letter and shatto letter are not responsive to the issues raised in the proposal or are aimed at existing elements of us market structure that have been previously approved by the commission the sifma letter primarily argues that the fees for the proposed bats one feed do not meet the requirements of the act including the requirement that such fees be “fair and reasonable” under section acc of the act sifma also contends that bats has circumvented the requirement to receive commission approval for this product by offering and marketing the bats one feed since august   in their response to the sifma letter the exchanges noted that the thrust of the sifma letter is aimed at the initially proposed fees which have now been removed from the proposed rule changes and are to be filed with the commission via separate rule filings start printed page the exchanges also noted that while the sifma letter correctly states that bats has marketed the bats one feed since august   the sifma letter incorrectly asserts that bats has offered the bats one feed since that same date the exchanges have represented that all of their marketing materials have included statements that the bats one feeds implementation was pending to commission approval and at no point have the exchanges offered the bats one product for any use other than for testing and certification iv discussion and commission findings after carefully considering the proposals and the comments submitted the commission finds that the proposed rule changes as modified by amendments nos  and  are consistent with the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges in particular the commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section acc of the act  and with rule a of regulation nms thereunder which requires that any national securities exchange national securities association broker or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock to a securities information processor broker dealer or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory the commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the commission notes that to create the bats one feed the exchanges would use underlying data feeds that belong to the exchanges the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed accordingly the commissions review of the exchanges proposals has focused in particular on whether the proposals would result in affiliated exchanges—which are separate selfregulatory organizations under the act—making their data products or services available to one another at terms eg content pricing or latency that are more favorable than those available to unaffiliated market participants the exchanges have represented that the bats one feed would be created using underlying data feeds that are available for subscription by vendors in recognition that the exchanges are the source of their own market data and that they are affiliated with one another the exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available all of the individual underlying feeds and that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors with respect to latency the exchanges have represented that competing vendors could locate their servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed and therefore could receive the underlying data feeds at the same time as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed therefore the exchanges have contended that a competing vendor could obtain the underlying data feeds from the exchanges on the same latency basis as the system that would be performing the aggregation and consolidation of the proposed bats one feed and could provide the same kind of product to its customers with the same latency they could achieve by purchasing the bats one feed from the exchanges the exchanges have also represented that they have designed the bats one feed so that they would have no advantages over a competing vendor with respect to the speed of access to the underlying feeds with respect to pricing although specific fees to be charged for the bats one feed are not part of the proposed rule changes the exchanges have represented that they will assess a fee that is at least equal to the aggregate cost of the underlying feeds ie at least as much as the cost to a vendor of subscribing to each of the underlying data feeds plus an additional amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function performed to create the bats one feed based on the exchanges representations with respect to the content latency and pricing of the bats one feed—which are central to the commissions analysis of the proposal—the commission finds that the exchanges proposals are consistent with the act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges the commission believes that these representations are designed to ensure that bats byx edga and edgx which are separate selfregulatory organizations do not because of their relationship as affiliates offer one another products or services on a more favorable basis than that available to other competing market participants for the foregoing reasons the commission finds that the proposed rule changes as amended are consistent with section acc of the act and rule a of regulation nms start printed page thereunder and sections b and b of the act v accelerated approval of proposed rule changes as modified by amendments no  the amendments no  revised the proposed rule changes to i clarify how the bats one feed would be created ii make additional clarifying statements with respect to the latency and cost of the bats one feed and iii bring together the discussion of key aspects of the description of the proposal in the same section accordingly the commission does not believe that the amendments no  raises any novel regulatory issues and therefore finds that good cause exists to approve the proposals as modified by amendments nos  and  on an accelerated basis vi solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to submit written data

that in order to create the bats one feed the system creating and supporting the bats one feed would need to receive the underlying data feeds from each exchange and in turn aggregate and summarize

argued that bats has circumvented the process of receiving commission approval and has been actively offering and marketing the bats one feed for months the commission notes however that the exchanges have represented that although they have been marketing the bats one feed all of their marketing materials have included statements that the bats one feeds implementation was pending to commission

section b of the securities exchange act of  the “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on march   bats yexchange inc the “exchange” or “byx” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the exchange has designated the proposed rule change as one establishing or changing a member due fee or other charge imposed by the exchange under section baii of the act  and rule bf thereunder which renders the proposed rule change effective upon filing with the commission the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange filed a proposal to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to i establish a digital media enterprise fee for the bats one feed and ii make a nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one feed enterprise fee the text of the proposed rule change is available at the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to i establish a digital media enterprise fee for the bats one feed and ii make a nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one feed enterprise fee the commission recently approved a proposed rule change by the exchange to establish a new market data product called the bats one feed  as well as published proposed rule changes to start printed page establish related fees the bats one feed is a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” of all displayed orders for securities traded on byx and its affiliated exchanges  and for which the bats exchanges report quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed also contains the individual last sale information for the bats exchanges collectively with the aggregate bbo the “bats one summary feed” in addition the bats one feed contains optional functionality which enables recipients to receive aggregated twosided quotations from the bats exchanges for up to five  price levels “bats one premium feed” bats one digital media enterprise fee the exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to establish a digital media enterprise fee of  per month for the bats one summary feed and  per month for the bats one premium feed as an alternative to user fees a recipient firm may purchase a monthly digital media enterprise license to receive the bats one feed from an external distributor  to distribute to an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users  for viewing via television web sites and mobile devices for informational and nontrading purposes only without having to account for the extent of access to the data or the report the number of users to the exchange the digital media enterprise fee would be in addition to the data consolidation fee nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the exchange proposes a nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the fee schedule currently states that “as an alternative to user fees a recipient firm may purchase a monthly enterprise fee to receive the bats one feed from an external distributor for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users” the exchange proposes to amend this sentence in two ways the first amendment is to state that a recipient firm may purchase a monthly enterprise license rather than enterprise fee as the term “license” is a more accurate description the second is to specify that the recipient firm purchasing a monthly enterprise license does so to distribute the bats one feed to an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users  statutory basis bats one digital media enterprise fee the exchange believes that the proposed digital media enterprise fee for the bats one feed is consistent with section b of the act in general and section b of the act in particular in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability to brokers dealers and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data products to the public it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data in addition the proposed fee is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because it will apply uniformly to market data vendors television broadcasters web site and mobile service providers the exchange believes it is reasonable to establish a lower cost fee structure that is designed to facilitate broader media distribution of the bats one data feed for informational purposes because it will benefit investors generally in establishing the digital media enterprise fee the exchange recognizes that there is demand for a more seamless and easiertoadminister data distribution mode that takes into account the expanded variety of media and communication devices that investors utilize today the exchange believes the digital media enterprise fee will be easy to administer because data recipients that purchase it would not be required to differentiate between professional and nonprofessional users account for the extent of access start printed page to the data or report the number of users this is a significant reduction on a recipient firms administrative burdens and is a significant value to investors for example a television broadcaster could display the bats one feed data during marketrelated programming and on its web site or allow viewers to view the data via their mobile devices creating a more seamless distribution model that will allow investors more choice in how they receive and view market data all without having to account for andor measure who accesses the data and how often they do so the proposed digital media enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it will also enable recipient firms to more widely distribute data from the bats one feed to investors for informational purposes at a lower cost than is available today for example a recipient firm may purchase an enterprise license in the amount of  per month for the bats one summary feed and  per month for the bats one premium feed to receive the bats one feed from an external distributor for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users which is greater than the digital media enterprise fee proposed herein the exchange also believes the amount of the digital enterprise sic is reasonable as compared to the existing enterprise fees discussed above because the distribution of bats one feed data is limited to television web sites and mobile devices for informational purposes only while distribution of the bats one feed data pursuant to an enterprise license contains no such limitation the exchange also believes that the proposed digital media enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it is less than similar fees charged by other exchanges the exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with bzx edga and edgx in proposing the digital media enterprise fee to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchange from a cost perspective while the bats exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the bats one feed they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the bats one feed as discussed in in sic the bats one fee proposal any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products and if they so choose perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the exchange performs in creating the bats one feed and offer a data feed with the same information included in the bats one feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the exchange to enable such competition the exchange is offering the digital media enterprise license for the bats one feed on terms that a subscriber of the underlying feeds could offer a competing product if it so chooses the bats one feed is comprised of data included in edgx depth edga depth byx depth and bzx depth currently an external distributor could create a competing product to the bats one premium feed  by purchasing each of these depth of book products from the individual bats exchanges and then performing its own aggregation and consolidation functions the combined external distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the bats exchanges is  per month an external distributor that seeks to create a competing product to the bats one summary feed could instead subscribe to the following data feeds edgx top edgx last sale edga top edga last sale bzx top bzx last sale byx top and byx last sale and then perform their own aggregation and consolidation function the combined external distributor fees for these individual data feeds of the bats exchanges is  per month the exchange proposes to charge a digital media enterprise fee  per month for the bats one summary feed and  per month for the bats one premium feed plus the  per month data consolidation fee that exceeds the combined external distributor fees for each of the individual feeds listed above to ensure that vendors could compete with the exchange by creating the same product as the bats one feed to sell to their clients at no greater cost than the exchange the decision of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in netcoalition v sec  fd  dc cir  upheld the commissions reliance upon the existence of competitive market mechanisms to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for proprietary market data in fact the legislative history indicates that the congress intended that the market system evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed and that the sec wield its regulatory power in those situations where competition may not be sufficient such as in the creation of a consolidated transactional reporting system id at  quoting hr rep no  at   as reprinted in  usccan  the court agreed with the commissions conclusion that “congress intended that competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the us national market system for trading equity securities ”  as explained below in the exchanges statement on burden on competition the exchange believes that there is substantial evidence of competition in the marketplace for data and that the commission can rely upon such evidence in concluding that the fees established in this filing are the product of competition and therefore satisfy the relevant statutory standards in addition the existence of alternatives to the bats one feed including realtime consolidated data free delayed consolidated data and proprietary last sale data from other sources as described below further ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably start printed page discriminatory when vendors and users can elect such alternatives as the netcoalition decision noted the commission is not required to undertake a costofservice or ratemaking approach and the exchange incorporates by reference into this proposed rule change its affiliates sic analysis of this topic in another rule filing for these reasons the exchange believes that the proposed fees are reasonable equitable and not unfairly discriminatory nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the exchange believes that the proposed change to the bats one enterprise fee is consistent with section b of the act in general and section b of the act in particular in that it provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the proposal to amend the description of the enterprise fee within the fee schedule is equitable and reasonable because the changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion the proposed changes do not amend the amount or application of the bats one enterprise fee the proposed changes are also nondiscriminatory as they would apply to all recipient firms uniformly b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act as amended bats one digital media enterprise fee the bats one feed digital media enterprise fee will enhance competition because it provides investors with an alternative option for receiving market data and competes directly with similar market data products currently offered by the nyse and nasdaq the exchange notes that there is already actual competition for products similar to the bats one feed the nyse offers bqt which provides bbo and last sale information for the nyse nyse arca equities inc and nyse mkt llc nasdaq offers nasdaq basic a filed market data product and through its affiliate offers nls plus which provides a unified view of last sale information similar to the bats one feed the existence of these competing data products demonstrates that there is ample existing competition for products such as the bats one feed and the fees associated by such products is constrained by competition in establishing the proposed fees the exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition the exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors in order to establish fair reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all users the existence of alternatives to the bats one feed including the existing underlying feeds consolidated data and proprietary data from other sources ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory when vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase finally although the bats exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements would be taken to create the bats one feed the exchange is not the exclusive distributor of the aggregated and consolidated information that would compose the bats one feed the exchange has taken into consideration its affiliated relationship with bzx edga and edgx in its design of the bats one feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchange from a cost perspective while the bats exchanges are the exclusive distributors of the individual data feeds from which certain data elements may be taken to create the bats one feed they are not the exclusive distributors of the aggregated and consolidated information that comprises the bats one feed as discussed in in the bats one fee proposal any entity may separately purchase the individual underlying products and if they so choose perform a similar aggregation and consolidation function that the exchange performs in creating the bats one feed and offer a data feed with the same information included in the bats one feed to sell and distribute it to its clients with no greater cost than the exchange to enable such competition the amount of the proposed digital media enterprise license compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the bats exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the exchange the amount of the proposed digital media enterprise license coupled with the data consolidation fee is not lower than the cost to a vendor of receiving the underlying data feeds to create a competing product therefore the amount of the proposed digital media enterprise license the exchange would charge clients for the bats one feed compared to the cost of the individual data feeds from the bats exchanges would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no greater cost than the exchange nonsubstantive change to the description of the bats one enterprise fee the proposal to amend the description of the enterprise fee within the fee schedule will not have any impact on completion sic the proposed changes are designed to clarify the fee schedule and avoid potential investor confusion and do not amend the amount or application of the bats one enterprise fee start printed page  c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange has neither solicited nor received
