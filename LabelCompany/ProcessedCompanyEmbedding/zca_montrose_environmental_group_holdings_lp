percent investments in alaskas ketchikan pulp company ketchikan spruce mills inc and ketchikan international sales company however georgiapacific had kept most of its lowcost timber reserves and the bulk of its tree farms for itself thus the newly independent lp had to scramble for raw materials particularly timber as the july   portland oregonian explained this proved to be an especially difficult task as timber shortages wracked the entire industry overcutting japanese demand for logs and pressure on the us forest service to tighten harvesting restrictions on large trees caused prices to soar to make matters worse lp lost  acres of harvestable oldgrowth timberland with the expansion of the redwood national park in northern california merlo strove to shepherd the company

in  we recognized that the days of making wood products from big trees were numbered for both economic and environmental reasons in the late s the company began manufacturing osb by slicing logs into

construction industry by offering a less expensive stronger alternative to plywood sheathing and subflooring after opening its first innerseal mill in  lp advertised the product as the smart mans plywood expansion during the sedit lps osb products protected the company from some of the vicissitudes of the timber market buoyed by this success the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include ibeams for floor joists and rafters these structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts yet were stronger and lighter lp also introduced a concrete form of innerseal and in  began to market innerseal siding for the exterior of homes driven by these breakthroughs a housing boom and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products lps sales grew  percent between  and  according to the portland oregonian during the same period its profits increased  percent moreover osb products accounted for an escalating portion of the companys total sales only six percent of sales in  the innerseal line by  amounted to almost  percent of total sales volume lps sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from  to  percent over the same period in  the company purchased kirby forest industries and the california properties of timber realization company

curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products the pulp market also experienced slowing growth in  after a fouryear period of rapidly rising prices pulp manufacturers then faced eroding profit margins due to worldwide economic problems and larger than normal inventories although lp saw its own pulp sales and profits peak in mid and expected only a minor recovery in  the company continued to operate three pulp manufacturing mills one mill supplied paper pulp to nonintegrated paper producers a second mill produced dissolving pulp for manufacturers of rayon and cellophane products the third and newest pulp mill using a bleached chemithermo mechanical pump process revolutionized pulp production by eliminating the use of chlorine and operated in a completely closed system without discharge into neighboring water supplies this mill marketed its output to manufacturers of printing and writing papers lp was able to rebound from the downturn of  while its competitors struggled in the face of dwindling timber supplies lp enjoyed record sales in   and  much of lps growth in the s came through acquisition of other building materials companies such as abtco in the eastern united states and forex in eastern canada according to the spokane journal of business lp was flourishing because it had vigorously developed alternatives to dimensional lumber and plywood indeed merlo told the wallstreet journal that technologynot oldgrowth timber resourceshad proven to be the companys lifeblood profits for  were up  percent from the previous year and in  the company achieved an alltime high of  billion in sales by that year only onethird of lps sales came from dimensional lumber—the studs and solid wood joists that frame houses—while over half its revenue came from osb products and another  percent from engineered wood products and pulp lawsuits threaten louisianapacifics futureedit despite its many achievements lp encountered a number of serious obstacles in the s foremost among these were lawsuits pertaining to its simulated cedar innerseal exterior siding during the s lp was the defendant in a major classaction lawsuit over its osb siding product known as inner seal manufactured from the early s through  the company had initiated the class action lawsuit to speed up the process and according to the judge presiding over the case got the most money to the most people in the quickest amount of time based on my experience many homeowners alleged that innerseal siding which carried a year warranty began to rot prematurely—discoloring disintegrating and even growing fungi the first claims surrounded the use of osb panels on the roofs of homes in florida following hurricane andrew in  some of these homes lost shingles exposing the osb panels to heavy rains reports claimed that the exposed osb began to deteriorate two years after the first suit lp had settled all related disputes lp reengineered the product now marketed as lpsmartside and since  has sold approximately  billion square feet of smartside siding with no warranty claims for fungal decay classaction suits brought by various collections of homeowners as well as the attorney general of minnesota were filed against the innerseal siding although lp admitted to no wrongdoing the company moved quickly to settle the cases at the close of  lp had paid over  million to settle osb claims and between  and  the company paid out an additional  million in  lp committed at least  million to a settlement with  homeowners who had used the innerseal siding in april  lp implemented a claimant offer program to speed payments to claimants in what was the largest classaction lawsuit in the history of the siding industry lp paid out more than  claims by the end of the settlement lp had paid almost  billion to satisfy claims lps woes did not end there however in  lp paid  million to settle a classaction lawsuit filed the previous year by lp shareholders who alleged that the company had violated securities laws by failing to disclose that the companys orientedstrand boards were defective as the portland oregonian reported on december   it was the largest securities settlement in oregon history also that year the company settled a  sexual harassment suit against merlo moreover the state of colorado brought a count indictment against lp in  charging fraud and environmental violations at its plant in montrose colorado the same year lps eightperson board lost confidence in the ability of merlo and his top two lieutenants to steer the fortune  company declared the august   edition of the portland oregonian merlo resigned and was replaced as chairman and ceo by mark suwyn a former executive at international paper rebuilding in the late sedit under this new leadership lp began the difficult task of regrouping the year  had been particularly difficult one in which the company endured a net loss of  million the market for building products had sunk as an influx of canadian lumber had flooded the united states high interest rates and poor weather which affected home building only exacerbated lps problems even more dangerous to lp however was the inauguration of several rival osb mills as osb increasingly replaced plywood as a basic construction material innerseal became less a specialty item exclusively made by lp and more of a building commodity faced with these new threats suwyn implemented a multidimensional plan for recovery first the company strove to eliminate unprofitable operations in  lp closed the ketchikan paper company as well as  plants and mills more closings followed in  and  and the company sold off a number of additional operations including the weatherseal door and window division in  all told lp sold over  million of assets during the threeyear period the assets sales will do two things for us suwyn told business wire they will provide us with additional financial flexibility to grow the company and allow us to focus all our management attention on becoming the premier supplier of building materials suwyn also concentrated on developing lps specialty products lines as its past innovations had become industry standards and were imitated by numerous competitors it was essential for lp to launch new products that would give the company an edge over its rivals to further this goal lp engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions in  lp purchased associated chemists a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry as well as greenstone industries a manufacturer of cellulose insulation and tecton laminates corp a producer of laminated veneer lumber and wood ijoists used in the construction industry two years later lp acquired abt building products corporation a transaction it heralded as a way to expand its specialty products lines and complement its lowcost commodity building products according to the wall street journal in  lp purchased evans forest products ltd a canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products lp did more than simply buy other companies however in  lp unveiled its advanced technology center which provided the company with the facilities to conceive test and improve new offerings lp soon introduced a bevy of new product systems including smart start siding techshield energy efficient structural panels topnotch flooring and cocoon insulation a final prong of lps rebuilding efforts involved improving operations in  the company instituted an intensive employee training course—rapid change technologies—designed to enhance workers communication skills and to empower them to accept new ideas with ease to increase productivity lp utilized business process improvement technology to make its osb mills more efficient lp also sought to bolster the companys relationship with large and national home center chains such as home depot and lowes these superstores represented the fastestgrowing segment of the building industry the outcome of lps vigorous reorganization was not immediately evident sales for  were  percent lower than in  and resulted in a net yearly loss of  million although the company again operated at a net loss of  million in  executives remained optimistic in  lp returned once more to profitability achieving  million of net

inventing alternatives to plywood and solid wood building products instead of relying on larger more expensive oldgrowth timber lp found ways to make structural building products from smalldiameter fastgrowing trees lp pioneered the use of oriented strand board osb — a reconstituted plywood substitute made by pressing wood wafers together osb is the basis for many of lps structural building products lp also manufacturers industrial wood products such as hardboard and medium density fiberboard which are used by furniture and cabinet makers furthermore along with wood products such as lpi joists and laminated veneer lumber the company also produces cocoon cellulose insulation plywood and pulp manufacturing round out lps operations the company controls over  acres of timberland and owns plants in  states as well as in canada and ireland lp was incorporated on january   as part of a courtordered monopoly breakup of georgiapacific lp was headed by company president harry a merlo for

– it owned the naming rights to lp field the stadium which houses the tennessee titans and tennessee state university football teams in nashville forming a new companyedit louisianapacific was formed in july  when the georgiapacific corporation spun off the wholly owned subsidiary after georgiapacific had acquired  small firms in the southern united states the federal trade commission ftc accused the company of becoming a monopolist in the softwood plywood industry as part of its settlement with the ftc georgiapacific agreed to divest  percent of its assets william h hunt a vicechairman at georgiapacific was selected as louisianapacifics first chairman in  harry a merlo who had been chief executive officer of lp since its foundation succeeded hunt as chairman while remaining ceo prior to the official spinoff of lp georgiapacific had transferred several of its operations to lp ownership including its samoa ukiah intermountain weatherseal and southern divisions as well as its  percent investments in alaskas ketchikan pulp company ketchikan spruce mills inc and ketchikan international sales company however georgiapacific had kept most of its lowcost timber reserves and the bulk of its tree farms for itself thus the newly independent lp had to scramble for raw materials particularly timber as the july   portland oregonian explained this proved to be an especially difficult task as timber shortages wracked the entire industry overcutting japanese demand for logs and pressure on the us forest service to tighten harvesting restrictions on large trees caused prices to soar to make matters worse lp lost  acres of harvestable oldgrowth timberland with the expansion of the redwood national park in northern california merlo strove to shepherd the company through its early difficulties lp acquired several lumber companies in california oregon montana washington missouri and alabama and in  it purchased the fibreboard corporation a manufacturer of products used in making furniture and cabinets in  the company bought fifteen buildingmaterial centers in southern california from lone star industries which provided lp with much needed distribution centers a breakthrough productedit to ensure its longterm success however lp would need to compensate for its comparative dearth of southern pine and douglas fir timber as well as lumber production to address this shortfall lp turned its attention to the development of wood products derived from lessexpensive and fastergrowing trees such as cottonwood and aspen as merlo told the portland oregonian in  we recognized that the days of making wood products from big trees were numbered for both economic and environmental reasons in the late s the company began manufacturing osb by slicing logs into wafers mixing the wafers with resin and then pressing them into sheets first introduced under the trade name waferwood later rechristened innerseal this new product line revolutionized the construction industry by offering a less expensive stronger alternative to plywood sheathing and subflooring after opening its first innerseal mill in  lp advertised the product as the smart mans plywood expansion during the sedit lps osb products protected the company from some of the vicissitudes of the timber market buoyed by this success the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include ibeams for floor joists and rafters these structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts yet were stronger and lighter lp also introduced a concrete form of innerseal and in  began to market innerseal siding for the exterior of homes driven by these breakthroughs a housing boom and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products lps sales grew  percent between  and  according to the portland oregonian during the same period its profits increased  percent moreover osb products accounted for an escalating portion of the companys total sales only six percent of sales in  the innerseal line by  amounted to almost  percent of total sales volume lps sales of lumber—once the mainstay of the building industry—decreased from  to  percent over the same period in  the company purchased kirby forest industries and the california properties of timber realization company from these transactions lp gained almost  acres of timberland which helped balance the land taken in  for redwood national park lp received a final payment of  million from the government for this land in  in  lp bought weather guard inc a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint as well as mitek wood products a north carolinabased producer of laminated veneer lumber and engineered wood ibeams the early sedit during  sales and profits in the companys softwood lumber plywood and building products areas slumped due to weakening demand this situation was attributed to an
