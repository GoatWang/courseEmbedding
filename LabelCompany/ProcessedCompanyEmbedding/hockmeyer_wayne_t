a contributing writer based in boston kenhowardmindspringcom leveraging a background in vaccines and leadership skills learned in the army wayne hockmeyer made a midcareer shift and built a biotech juggernaut he is now onto his third career founding a company and taking it to a billion dollars in revenue is not bad for a lifes work for wayne hockmeyer founder and former ceo of medimmune in gaithersburg maryland it was all done during his second career one sandwiched between two other distinguished careers see box  hockmeyers first job was with the us army where he served as an officer for  years earning his doctorate in entomology at the university of florida in gainesville along the way his last six years were as chairman of the department of immunology at walter reed army institute of research towards the end he was faced with signing up for another ten years or getting out if i was going to start a second career i thought i might as well start at  rather than  says hockmeyer so i took the leap and did it what he did was decide to get involved in biotech although big pharma seemed like a natural fit for someone with his background and interest in vaccine development he had already worked in a large research organization and wanted something smaller he says biotech seemed to be it even in the army i had thoughts about starting a company he explains and building a successful company is all about leadership the military is good at building leaders giving up and not succeeding is not part of the culture it takes that sticktoitiveness to be a successful entrepreneur you cant give up his first stop was at the startup praxis biologics in rochester new york which he joined as vice president of research and development a year into his first job outside the army the company went public his next big break came from a lunch meeting with seminal venture capitalist and healthcare ventures cofounder wally steinberg now deceased who shared hockmeyers interest in vaccines in the fall of  hockmeyer arranged a lunch meeting with steinberg in new york city wally was an interesting judge of people he would make decisions by betting on people and he bet on me says hockmeyer i never actually asked him why after three or four hours after lunch he would give me  million to start medimmune one reason speculates hockmeyer may have been his military background steinberg had worked with johnson  johnson in new brunswick new jersey which was run in the s by general robert wood johnson son of the company founder and a brigadier general in world war ii so the idea of going from the army to business was not foreign to him steinbergs bet proved prescient after switching medimmunes focus early on from creating and manufacturing raw vaccines to producing antibody products the company grew consistently started in  it had  million in revenue and  employees by  its first product cytogam human igg against cytomegalovirus was approved by the us food and drug administration in  and with the introduction in  of synagis the company created the first monoclonal antibody against respiratory syncytial virus approved for infectious disease as well as profitability by  it had  billion in revenue the company currently has approximately  employees worldwide and a market cap of approximately  billion at press time that impressive trajectory took hockmeyer from being a research scientist to a businessman starting a company  takes lots of hard work you hope youll be successful but there are things you cant control im not trying to talk people out of it but to give them a sense of realism you are forced to become a businessperson pretty fast as a ceo says hockmeyer its clear youre not going to be a practicing scientist any more i used to tell our head of research that for me to go into a lab anymore would be dangerous because youre engaged in business  youve got to keep those skills sharp all the time its a tradeoff you have to be willing to make beginning the uphill battle of starting a first company in middle age never phased hockmeyer biotech companies are not often started by  year olds now or then he observes its still driven by good ideas and good people its not linked to age and in addition to having had the scientific chops to understand the science he also felt his background allowed him to evaluate how a scientific idea might become a potential product biotech is successful not just because of good ideas but because you appreciate that markets which didnt look quite large enough were significant he says see box  he does admit to making mistakes along the way some that he terms life threatening to the company including forgoing the hiring of experienced people early on in an attempt to save money in our first go around with the fda we made major mistakes and didnt even realize it he says bringing in high level people early on is key he says as they can save you from critical mistakes a lot of entrepreneurs dont recognize that says hockmeyer he is trying to spread the word to a current crop of new ceos in his third career as mentor since stepping down from the top position at medimmune in  he remains chairman of the board in addition to mentoring a number of executives at marylandarea biotechs he sits on their boards as well as the boards of maryland business and technology booster organizations and he has followed in wally steinbergs footsteps by becoming a venture capitalist himself as president of medimmune ventures also in gaithersburg he says that after heading medimmune for  years i was out of gas on a daytoday basis if i took a sabbatical i would have been able to do it but i felt i couldnt drift off and come back and harkening back to his decision to go into biotech rather than pharma he says he enjoyed running the company when it was smaller and i feel new leadership is important i had a candidate to take over if the stars are lined up do it hockmeyer says he has no interest in becoming a ceo of a new company instead he will focus on looking for new ideas to support with his  million venture fund of which approximately  million has already been invested and he will continue to do his best to council and steer a current crop of new ceos toward the promise that a company success like medimmune holds out when meeting with people i want to make sure people are being realistic about starting a company says hockmeyer it takes lots of hard work you hope youll be successful but there are things you cant control im not trying to talk people out
