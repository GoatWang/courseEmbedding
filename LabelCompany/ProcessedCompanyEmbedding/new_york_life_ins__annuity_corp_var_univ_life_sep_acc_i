used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and benefits other than tax deferral in such cases tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity references throughout this material to tax advantages such as tax deferral and taxfree

the original order and each amendment thereto the notice of application for the original order and the original order to the extent necessary to supplement the representations made in the application in support of the requested relief applicants represent that all of the facts asserted in the application for the original order and any amendments thereto remain true and accurate in all material respects to the extent that such facts are relevant to any relief on which applicants continue to rely the original order allows the templeton trust to offer its shares to insurance companies as the investment vehicle for their separate accounts supporting variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts collectively the variable contracts applicants state that the original order does not i include the vip trust or future funds as parties nor ii expressly address the sale of shares of the funds or any future funds to qualified pension and retirement plans outside the separate account context including without limitation those trusts plans accounts contracts or annuities described in sections a a b b k d b c of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and any other trust plan contract account or annuity that is determined to be within the scope of treasury regulation fiii qualified plans  separate accounts owning shares of the funds and their insurance company depositors are referred to in the application as participating separate accounts and participating insurance companies respectively the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of a single insurance company or of two or more affiliated insurance companies is referred to as mixed funding the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity andor variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to as shared funding applicants legal analysis  applicants request that the commission issue an amended order pursuant to section c of the  act adding the vip trust and future funds to the original order and exempting scheduled premium variable life insurance separate accounts and flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts of participating insurance companies and to the extent necessary any principal underwriter and depositor of such an account and the applicants from sections a a a and b of the  act and rules eb and etb and any comparable rule thereunder respectively to the extent necessary to permit shares of the funds and any future funds to be sold to and held by  pexhth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th qualified plans applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  the original order does not include the vip trust or future funds as parties nor expressly address the sale of shares of the funds or any future funds to qualified plans applicants propose that the vip trust and future funds be added as parties to the original order and the funds and any future funds be permitted to offer and sell their shares to qualified plans  section c of the  act provides in part that the commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provisions of the  act or the rules or regulations thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a unit investment trust uit rule eb provides partial exemptions from various provisions of the  act including the following  section a which makes it unlawful for certain individuals to act in the capacity of employee officer or director for a uit by limiting the application of the eligibility restrictions in section a to affiliated persons directly participating in the management of a registered management investment company and  sections a a and b of the  act to the extent that those sections might be deemed to require passthrough voting with respect to an underlying funds shares by allowing an insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contractowners in certain circumstances  these exemptions are available however only where the management investment company underlying the separate account the underlying fund offers its shares exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company therefore rule e does not permit either mixed funding or shared funding because the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company rule eb also does not permit the sale of shares of the underlying fund to qualified plans  in connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a uit rule etb also provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act these exemptions however are available only where the separate accounts underlying fund offers its shares exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company therefore rule et permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding and also does not permit the sale of shares of the underlying fund to qualified plans as noted above the original order granted the templeton trust exemptive relief to permit mixed and shared funding but did not expressly address the sale of its shares to qualified plans  applicants note that if the funds were to sell their shares only to qualified plans exemptive relief under rule e and rule et would not be necessary applicants state that the relief provided for under rule eb and rule etb does not relate to qualified pension and retirement plans or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such plans  applicants state that changes in the federal tax law have created the opportunity for each of the funds to increase its asset base through the sale of its shares to qualified plans applicants state that section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying variable contracts treasury regulations generally require that to meet the diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the underlying investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more life insurance companies notwithstanding this applicants note that the treasury regulations also contain an exception to this requirement that permits trustees of a qualified plan to hold shares of an investment company the shares of which are also held by insurance company segregated asset accounts without adversely affecting the status of the investment  pexhst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st company as an adequately diversified underlying investment of variable contracts issued through such segregated asset accounts treas reg fiii  applicants state that the promulgation of rules eb and etb under the  act preceded the issuance of these treasury regulations thus applicants assert that the sale of shares of the same investment company to both separate accounts and qualified plans was not contemplated at the time of the adoption of rules eb and etb  section a provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in section a or  rules eb and etb provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying portfolio investment company  applicants state that the relief granted in rule eb and etb from the requirements of section  limits in effect the amount of monitoring of an insurers personnel that would otherwise be necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  applicants submit that those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to the many individuals involved in an insurance company complex most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies funding the separate accounts  applicants to the original order previously requested and received relief from section a and rules eb and etb to the extent necessary to permit mixed and shared funding applicants maintain that the relief previously granted from section a will in no way be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the funds to qualified plans those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the funds will remain the same regardless of which qualified plans use such funds applicants maintain that more broadly applying the requirements of section a because of investment by qualified plans would not serve any regulatory purpose moreover qualified plans unlike separate accounts are not themselves investment companies and therefore are not subject to section  of the  act  applicants state that rules ebiii and etbiii provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirement with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contractowners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of the rules rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard contractowners voting instructions if the contractowners initiate any change in such companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii and biib and c of the rules  applicants assert that qualified plans which are not registered as investment companies under the  act have no requirement to passthrough the voting rights to plan participants applicants state that applicable law expressly reserves voting rights to certain specified persons under section a of the employment retirement income security act erisa shares of a fund sold to a qualified plan must be held by the trustees of the qualified plan section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the qualified plan with two exceptions  when the qualified plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan and not contrary to erisa and  when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the qualified plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the two above exceptions stated in section a applies qualified plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies where a named fiduciary to a qualified plan appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such  pexhnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among variable contract holders and qualified plan investors with respect to voting of the respective funds shares accordingly applicants state that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to such qualified plans since the qualified plans are not entitled to passthrough voting privileges  even if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in one of the funds applicants believe that such control would not disadvantage other investors in such fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in a fund by a qualified plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed funding or shared funding unlike mixed or shared funding qualified plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  applicants state that some of the qualified plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants where a qualified plan provides participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants see no reason to believe that participants in qualified plans generally or those in a particular qualified plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other qualified plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract holders in sum applicants maintain that the purchase of shares of the funds by qualified plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares of the funds to qualified plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond that which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance contractowners  as noted above section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable contracts held in an underlying mutual fund the code provides that a variable contract shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance as applicable for any period and any subsequent period for which the investments are not in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury department adequately diversified  treasury department regulations issued under section h provide that in order to meet the statutory diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies however the regulations contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which allows shares in an underlying mutual fund to be held by the trustees of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the underlying fund also to be held by separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts treas reg fiii thus applicants believe that the treasury regulations specifically permit qualified pension or retirement plans and separate accounts to invest in the same underlying fund for this reason applicants have concluded that neither the code nor the treasury regulations or revenue rulings thereunder presents any inherent conflict of interest  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from variable contracts and qualified plans are taxed these differences will have no impact on the funds when distributions are to be made and a separate account or qualified plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the distributions the separate account and qualified plan will redeem shares of the funds at their respective net asset value in conformity with rule c under the  act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a qualified plan will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the qualified plan  applicants maintain that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to participating separate account contractowners and to qualified plans in connection with any meeting of shareholders the funds will inform each shareholder including each participating insurance company and qualified plan of information necessary for the meeting including their respective share of ownership in the relevant fund each participating insurance company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with rules e and et as applicable and its participation agreement with the relevant fund shares held by qualified plans will be voted in accordance with  pexhrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd applicable law the voting rights provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of the funds would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to qualified plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general public  applicants have concluded that even if there should arise issues with respect to a state insurance commissioners veto powers over investment objectives where the interests of contractowners and the interests of qualified plans are in conflict the issues can be almost immediately resolved since the trustees of or participants in the qualified plans can on their own redeem the shares out of the funds applicants note that state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies usually cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest in another generally timeconsuming complex transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers conversely the trustees of qualified plans or the participants in participantdirected qualified plans can make the decision quickly and redeem their interest in the funds and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments faced by separate accounts or as is the case with most qualified plans even hold cash pending suitable investment  applicants also state that they do not see

used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and
