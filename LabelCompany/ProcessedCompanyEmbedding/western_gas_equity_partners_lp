general and administrative expenses  adjusted gross margin as defined below  adjusted ebitda as defined below and throughput throughput is an essential operating variable wes uses in assessing its ability to generate revenues in order to maintain or increase throughput on wess gathering and processing systems wes must connect additional wells to its systems wess success in maintaining or increasing throughput is impacted by the successful drilling of new wells by producers that are dedicated to wess systems recompletions of existing wells connected to its systems its ability to secure volumes from new wells drilled on nondedicated acreage and its ability to attract natural gas ngl or crude oil volumes currently serviced by its competitors during the year ended december   wes added

adjusted gross margin as total revenues and other less cost of product and reimbursements for electricityrelated expenses recorded as revenue plus distributions from equity investments and excluding the noncontrolling interest owners proportionate share of revenue and cost of product wes believes adjusted gross margin is an important performance measure of the core profitability of its operations as well as its operating performance as compared to that of other companies in the industry cost of product expenses include i costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and ngls pursuant to wess percentofproceeds and keepwhole processing contracts ii costs associated with the valuation of wess gas imbalances and iii costs associated with wess obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by wes and sold to third parties these expenses are subject to variability although a majority of wess exposure to commodity price risk inherent in its percentofproceeds and keepwhole contracts is mitigated through its commodity price swap agreements with anadarko for a discussion of commodity price swap agreements see risk factors under part i item a and note transactions with affiliates in the notes to consolidated financial statements under part ii item  of this form k to facilitate

financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a companys ability to incur and service debt fund capital expenditures and make distributions adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that wess management and external users of wess consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following among other measures wess operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure or historical cost basis the ability of wess assets to generate cash flow to make distributions and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities distributable cash flow wes defines distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda plus interest income and the net settlement amounts

paid for interest expense including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs originally paid in cash offset by noncash capitalized interest maintenance capital expenditures series a preferred unit distributions and income taxes wes compares distributable cash flow to the cash distributions wes expects to pay its unitholders using this measure wess management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of distributable cash flow to planned cash distributions wes believes distributable cash flow is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies analysts and others in the
