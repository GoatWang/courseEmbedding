with certainty even before the first pitch conference titles have been forgone conclusions often on south main its been about chasing national titles at rice not just ncaa tournament berths but the owls are in unfamiliar waters in  playing to keep a year streak of postseason baseball alive with the conference usa tournament as the only inroad and even that inroad isnt certain weve got to get in the conference tournament first rice coach wayne graham said rice   in cusa play is in bowling green ky to face the only team its ahead of in the conference standings in a weekend series against western kentucky story continues below   college sports highlights there is no doubt it has to be the start of what would be a miraculous turnaround rice has lost every series in conference play this season the owls sit three games out of the eighth and final spot available for the conference tournament rice has made every ncaa tournament since  rices year streak of either a regular season or conference tournament title ended last year this is about as far on the other end of the spectrum for one of the countrys premier programs as it can get its weird said rice sophomore catcher dominic dicaprio who had an outstanding week with  hitting two rbis and three runs in four games coming last year as a freshman being part of the team that has the streak and everything it was more like everybodys coming in to beat us now its like oh this is an easy win for us thats what i hear other teams saying we have to flip the script a little bit we have the hunt the other teams one of two wins last week was against rival university of houston on ryan chandlers walkoff rbi it won rice the silver glove for the first time since  and right now is the highlight of rices season so whats gone wrong dicaprio said the team hasnt played a complete game often sometimes the pitching is missing sometimes its the hitting graham said look at the walkstoinnings pitched stat rice is second in the conference with  walks allowed this staff averages about six per game rice allowed  total last year control issues arent new to the owls but its perhaps never been more problematic than now it really has been hard graham said its been hard to watch were trying to get matters going right but we havent theres still a possibility because theres still some guys with good arms out there to pitch but were one of the leaders in the walkstoinnings pitched category rice finishes the last month of the regular season in conference play with a home series against utsa at charlotte back home against middle tennessee state and on the road against uab its a far cry from one of the tougher nonconference slates around that included texas texas am tcu dallas baptist and stanford among others but conference usa was a fourbid league in the ncaa tournament last year too so its gotten deeper graham said there is always a chance once finals are through on may  the level of play will improve but rice is running out of schedule dicaprio said the team cant be caught looking at the big picture thats pretty much what its got to be from now on dicaprio said we cant think about oh we have to win this many games we have to think about win this inning win this pitch thats all we can do texas sports nation jeff bagwell joins long list of hall of famers with houston ties strategic and calculated

agriculture remains the most important sector in terms of domestic consumption and is in second place behind mining in terms of export earnings tourism accounts for more than  billion in annual earnings free trade zone earnings and tourism are the fastestgrowing export sectors according to a  international monetary fund report remittances from dominican americans are estimated to be about

from the ftzs expected that entry into force of the caftadr agreement will promote substantial growth in the ftz sector for  an ongoing concern in the dominican republic is the inability of

categories the industrial sector contributed an estimated  percent to the countrys gdp in  led by mining ferronickel gold and silver and the manufacture of goods for export to the united states to a lesser extent there is the manufacture of food products consumer nondurables and building materials for the local market and for neighboring haiti the sector employed an estimated  percent of the workforce in  about  companies in the dominican republic manufacture goods primarily for the north american market situated in  industrial free zones around the country these mostly foreignowned corporations take advantage of generous tax and other financial inducements offered by the government to businesses that operate within the zones approximately  people or about  percent of the workforce are employed in this sector they mostly produce clothing electronic components footwear and leather goods which are assembled the raw materials or semimanufactured goods are usually imported dutyfree from other developing countries electronic parts are imported from industrialized puerto rico and put together in the free zones products created are cosmetics pharmaceuticals textiles perfumes  foodstuffs the value of exports amounted to us billion in  but the contribution to the trade balance was only us million because many of the basic materials for the free zones had to be imported and paid for other more traditional manufacturing is based on sugar refining cement iron and steel production and food processing rum is a significant export commodity and beer and cigarettes are manufactured for local consumption most industry of this sort is located around the workingclass perimeter of santo domingo and other large towns tertiary industriesedit services were estimated to

has become one of the country’s most important sources of foreign exchange and more popular tourist destinations the country is famous for its favorable location in the caribbean tropical climate beaches and the restored spanish colonial architecture many foreign investors have and continue to be encouraged to invest here to build and expand resorts and airports around the coasts during this same period tourism displaced sugar as the main source of the countrys earnings and by  it was generating more than half of the countrys total foreign exchange tourism is the single biggest revenue earner with receipts increasing more than tenfold from us million in  to more than us billion by  according to the central bank the dominican republic received us billion in revenues from the tourism sector in  successive governments have invested heavily in tourism development creating upgraded airports and other infrastructure  million tourists arrived in the country in  not including visiting

directly employed in this sector mostly working in hotels and another  are indirectly employed as taxi drivers tour guides or touristshop staff most tourists visit the dominican republic on account of its beaches but there is an expanding ecotourism and outdoor activity sector focused on the countrys mountains and wildlife although tourism generates large revenues some scholars and activists argue
