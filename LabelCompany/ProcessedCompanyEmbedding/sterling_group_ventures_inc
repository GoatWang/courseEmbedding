capital limited on april   the company signed a purchase and sale agreement agreement with chenguo capital limited chenguo as a result of the transaction the company had plans to diversify and become a timeshare exchange provider a manager of timeshare assets through agreements and a developer of timeshare assets with fee relationships with other organizations or resorts under the terms of the

and recorded  and an additional  for expenses incurred by the other parties affiliated with chenguo termination in due diligence cost in the consolidated statement of operations the company has determined there is a contingent liability related to the cancellation of the  shares related to the finders fee based on the early stage of the claim and evaluation of the facts available at this time the amount or range of reasonably possible losses to which the company is exposed cannot be estimated and the ultimate resolution of this matter and the associated financial impact to the company if any remains uncertain at this time we believe the claim is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates our condensed interim consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this quarterly report we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note  to our annual financial statements the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly the following policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation these consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our company and our whollyowned subsidiaries micro express holdings inc micro express ltd huyana ventures limited makaelo holdings inc makaelo limited silver castle investments limited silver castle and our  controlled subsidiary chenxi county hongyu mining co ltd hongyu all intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated interim reporting the information presented in the accompanying condensed interim consolidated financial statements is without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading these statements reflect all adjustments which are in the opinion of management necessary to present fairly the financial position results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america except where noted the condensed interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as our may   annual consolidated financial statements all adjustments are of a normal recurring nature it is suggested that these condensed interim consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with our may   annual consolidated financial statements operating results for the six months ended november   are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending may   mineral property costs costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalized by the project area costs to maintain mineral rights and leases are expensed as incurred when a property reaches the production state the related capitalized costs are amortized using the unit of production method on the basis of annual estimates of ore reserves the company does not consider a resource property to be at the development stage until such time as either mineral reserve are proven or permits to operate the mineral resource property are received and financing to complete the development has been obtained development expenditures incurred subsequent to a development decision and to increase or to extend the life of existing production are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method based upon estimated proven and probable reserves or resources management reviews the carrying value of mineral properties at least annually and will recognize impairment in value based upon current exploration results and any impairment or subsequent losses are charged to operations at the time of impairment if a property is abandoned or sold its capitalized costs are charged to operations mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred exploration activities conducted jointly with others are reflected at the companys proportionate interest in such activities as at may   management reviewed the carrying value of the mineral properties and the environmental deposit and determined that the prolonged and significant decline in phosphate prices and the lack of a current and foreseeable planned exploration budget on its gaoping phosphate property and has impaired these assets to a nominal value an impairment charge of  has been recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended may   as at november   and  the company did not have proven or probable ore reserves stockbased compensation the company accounts for stockbased compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation  stock compensation  overall in accordance with asc  the compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period which approximates the vesting period asc topic  requires excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid

currency translation our functional and reporting currency is us dollars our consolidated financial statements are translated to us dollars in accordance with asc  foreign currency matters monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date gains and losses arising on translation or settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions or balances are included in the determination of income we have not to the date of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations use of estimates the preparation of condensed interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period actual results could differ from these estimates going concern these condensed interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that adequate sources of financing will be obtained as required and that our assets will be realized and liabilities settled in the ordinary course of business these condensed interim consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern in order to continue as a going concern we require additional financing there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or if available that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms if we are not able to continue as a going concern we would likely be unable to realize the carrying value of our assets reflected in the balances set out in the preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements at november   the company had not yet achieved profitable operations and has accumulated losses of  since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business all of which casts substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due on november   the company signed a share exchange agreement through which the company acquired euroclub and its operations in the online gaming business on november   the company completed a private placement for  in order to help fund its existing operations and euroclubs operations the company has no assurance that euroclubs operations will be able to fund the companys operations in the shortterm but considers that the company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available results of operations the company had no operating revenue except interest income

three months ended november   when compared to the same period in  and accounting audit legal and professional fees increased by  for the six months ended november   when compared to the same period in  this was primarily due to an increase in audit and legal fees arising from the cancellation of the purchase and sale agreement with chenguo depreciation decreased by  for the three months ended november   when compared to the same period in  and depreciation decreased by  for the six months ended november   when compared to the same period in  this decrease was as a result of some equipment becoming fully depreciated and because the company was in a maintenance period no new equipment was purchased foreign exchange gain loss increased by  for the three months ended november   when compared to the same period in  while foreign exchange gain loss increased by  for the six months ended november   when compared to the same period in  because of the exchange rate fluctuation among

when compared to the same period in  and mineral property costs decreased by  for the six months ended november   when compared to the same period in  because the gaoping phosphate property was kept in care and maintenance mode during the period ended november   due to ongoing challenges in the phosphate market shareholder information and investor relations increased by  for the three months ended november   when compared to the same period in  while shareholder information increased by  for the six months ended november   when compared to the same period in  due to the announcements relating to the share exchange agreement signed with euroclub filing fee and transfer agent increased by  for the three months ended november   when compared to the same period in  while filing fee and transfer agent increased by  for the six months ended november   when compared to the same period in  the company expects the trend of losses to continue until we can achieve operating income from our online gaming business of which there can be no assurance as described in risk factors liquidity and working capital as of november   the company had total current assets of  and total current liabilities of  as of november   the company had cash totaling  and a working capital balance of  this is an increase from the previous quarter due to the private placement completed on november   of which  was retained by sterling with the balance advanced to euroclub a balance of approximately  of cash is held on deposit in china at november   accessing the cash held on deposits in hongyu is difficult due to the people republic of china laws and regulations relating to intercorporate transfers and capital accounts cash used in operating activities for the six months ended november   was  as compared to cash used in operating activities for the six months ended november   was  this increase was due to fees arising out of the cancellation of the purchase and sale agreement with chenguo as well as the signing of the share exchange agreement with euroclub the company has no other capital resources other than the ability to use its common stock to raise additional capital or the exercise of the warrants by the unit holders if all warrants outstanding are exercised the company will receive approximately  million in cash the companys current cash cannot meet its needs for the next  months the company is currently looking at funding its activities such as a private placement related party advances sale of noncore assets and possible repatriation of our foreign capital the company believes it needs to raise  in order to meet its needs for the next  months the cash will be mainly used for general administrative corporate accounting audit and legal financing management and for the online gaming operations of euroclub the company completed a private placement on november   for  of which  was advanced to euroclub the company currently does not have commitments in place for further financing as of the date of this filing no other commitments to provide additional funds have been made by management or other stockholders except as set forth above accordingly there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to the company to allow it to cover operation expenses this raises substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue as
