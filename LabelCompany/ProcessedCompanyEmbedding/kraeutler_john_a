into the marketplace enhancements of existing products or new products that incorporate technological advances meet customer requirements and respond to products developed by meridian’s competition while meridian has introduced a number of internally developed products there can be no assurance that it will be successful in the future in introducing such products on a timely basis ongoing consolidations of reference laboratories and formation of multihospital alliances may cause adverse changes to pricing and distribution costs and difficulties in complying with laws and regulations administered by the united states food and drug administration can result in unanticipated expenses and delays and interruptions to the sale of new and existing products changes in the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar can change expected results one of meridian’s main growth strategies is the acquisition of companies and product lines there can be no assurance that additional

bioscience vivo meridian bioscience inc nasdaqvivo baird  global healthcare conference september    am et executives john kraeutler  chief executive officer analysts catherine sazdanoff  robert w baird  co john kraeutler good morning everybody and thank you to baird for the invitation as always weve been longterm partners with baird and we always appreciate coming to their conferences they seem to get the best meetings and really get pms that appreciate our story our story is a bit unique you will see that i have only got two slides today because most of our conversation is fireside chat so i dont have to warn that talks about warning you about forward looking statements so i will warn you verbally that we may be talking about things that may or may not come true in the future but please take the appropriate heed our business was founded in  so we are coming up on our th year and we have been driven by essentially making lab diagnostics much simpler but also being extremely efficient financially the company started paying a dividend in  and we paid one every year since then today we are paying at a fairly high rate up north of  of earnings which should tell you two things one is we are profitable and like many companies in the biomedical space or unlike many companies in the biomedical space we actually do generate profit very high gross profits in the mid s high operating income around  and after tax around  and we have been able to sustain numbers like that for at least the last  years we do acquire but our organic growth rates are expected to be somewhere in the  to  range so that when we acquire its incremental to whatever our organic growth happens to be the slide that i’m going to share with you i think is a slide that allows us to go into a number of directions we are very specific about the parts of our business and where the growth is coming from so the slide that you are looking at shows vivo at about a  million rate for this year and we are on a  october  begins our new fiscal year so we are just wrapping up fiscal  the life science piece of it is important it is a part of our business that began in  a very small piece back then around  million and essentially this business is supplying the biological raw materials to other large diagnostic companies such as siemens or abbot roche or jj also to research laboratories and a lot of work was being done by startup companies that are trying to get into the space a good example of that is every time an abbot instrument anywhere in the world run a hepatitis a test meridian grew that protein and purified it and sold that to abbot and that becomes integral to their diagnostic test recently zika biologicals had become very important for us and you may be familiar with all the companies that are chasing after zika to try to develop a test we are supplying raw biologicals to many of those companies i say raw biologicals they are highly purified biologicals but they are essentially the biologicals that are used as a basis for those test and zika has snuck up on us this year and we will do nearly a  million in zika biologicals in fiscal  we are not really sure where that market is going but thats a great example of an emerging market that may never become a huge commercial success other than blood unit screening but meridian is at the forefront because we had the biologicals that are being used by those companies so our life science business well over  million this year it should grow  million to  million next year organically with a lot of that growth coming from the one i just mentioned zika but also a lot of emerging opportunities in china where the chinese diagnostic companies want to buy their biologicals from the company that supplies the large western diagnostic companies our china business in the life science has grown from about  four years ago to over  million this year and its growing quite rapidly and it gets in under the reimbursement sealing because we are supplying part of the diagnostic rather than a finish diagnostic that usually gets collaborate by low reimbursement rates we got into the molecular business about six years ago with a brand called illumigene and illumigene is a very simple platform its a piece of equipment that the customer doesn’t pay for they do  test a year replace the reader for free in their laboratory and they have got a three year commitment to us to use that reader we now have over  placements and a menu of about  tests in illumigene so our positioning for illumigene is different than a lot of the molecular companies that have chosen one or two targets and they have got a single piece of capital equipment and they hope that they are either going to make it or not make it based upon the success of that target we have got  targets we are adding three to five a year and we want to illumigene to end up as the best value molecular system in the laboratory almost one you can’t do without as oppose to getting into the trading capital equipment which is drilling on with so many of the businesses if you look at the molecular space its been very hard for six or seven years wall street has chased a lot of these startup companies many of them are falling back to earth and you probably saw yesterday that sofie got acquired so that’s a consolidations taken place there is not many other players that have viable systems other than a meridian or sofie or something that are embedded like in a becton dickinson so molecular should grow also mid to high single digits somewhere in the  to  range going forward and there is a number of new products that would be announced going into the future that fit into that with one of the harder new products being our product for malaria diagnostics very very successful sensitive assay which is doing well in europe right now its beginning to go into the emerging market in africa but you have to get into the bureaucracy in of way healthcare has paid for in that marketplace magellan is an acquisition we did in march of this year magellan has a proprietary system for doing blood lead levels children that are covered by medicaid at year one and year two they must be tested for blood lead magellan was a business that was owned by a private equity firm for about six or seven years which made magellan very financially efficient but somewhat restricted in its global marketing they were only in the us pediatrician office our goal with magellan is to keep them growing on their current trajectory but also to get magellan into other specialties in the united states and then get them outside the united states i mentioned china china is very opportunistic market for us where the government has said “we believe more than  of our children had elevated blood lead levels and we want to do something about it” so we are in the process right now are looking for  i shouldn’t say looking for evaluating a number of distribution partners that have clamored for this particular product i’m looking at magellan as a  grower the number you are looking at is around  million that was fiscal  actually this year they will come in somewhere around  million to  million so for fiscal  we are looking for another couple of million dollars on top of magellan and of course if china opens up then we will recast that number because it should be much stronger than that tier  rapid diagnostic is primarily our h pylori franchise h pylori being the primary cause of peptic ulcers this is the category that’s grown rapidly at  to  over the years we are tuning that one back a little bit because we come off patent in may of this year and although we haven’t seen much competition we don’t want to be too aggressive and we will be looking somewhere at  growth rate for fiscal  tier  diagnostic products these are legacy products products where there is a lot of generic competition this year there has been some erosion in that space  million to  million in that category we would probably look at another  million to  million of erosion going forward just because prices are difficult we expect more competition and it’s not really a focus area for our business so i believe the consensus for  is around  million for meridian we expect to launch guidance sometimes towards the end of september this is the first year where we are actually integrate magellan in so it’s taken us a few extra weeks to get our guidance ready but you should expect to see that so catherine if i can ill come over and join you questionandanswer session q  catherine sazdanoff thanks okay so with most excited recent magellan acquisition now starting in march how has that been going for forum as the integration what are your expectations for the year are they the same as when first announced john kraeutler we have done a series of acquisitions that very often they have very low margins and it took us three to five years to bring the margins up through magellan comparable margin because of private equity group had owned magellan they put a tremendous discipline into the business so going in and cutting costs was really never anything we had to consider we can look at strictly as a leverageable opportunity after we had fixed the price on magellan the flint michigan crisis broke so the number of new customers that were accessing has gone up the rate has gone up we expected magellan to be slightly dilutive this year and it looks like magellan borrowing the onetime charges is actually going to be slightly accretive this year so magellan currently is running ahead of expectations we have not articulated at what rate but they are beating their plan monthbymonth so we think it’s going quite well you asked about the integration magellan is essentially a turnkey for us they use a sensor based diagnostic technology which means that its different from meridian’s other seven or eight diagnostic platforms and if you went to magellan facility you would see it is primarily a production facility so relatively low ga overhead and a very very finetuned production facility our expectation is that probably within three years we are going to have to build out in that space for additional production and if china opens up which will not be in our guidance but if china opens up we might have to move faster on that so i think it’s gone extremely well the management teams have worked well together we have really yet to explore the leverage potential one of the things that attracted us to magellan aside from a well run business was they had  placements of their leadcare ii instrument in pediatrician offices and meridian’s business its diagnostic business is primarily a labbased business so outpatient labs hospital labs reference laboratories magellan had a very strong position in pointofcare and our interest in magellan was to be able to crosssell meridian’s diagnostics into the primary care markets but i would say we are extremely early in that process but it looks promising catherine sazdanoff and the a little bit on your fiscal  guidance then puts and takes there what is your level of confidence in that guidance and what are the biggest areas of risk for upsides john kraeutler yes i think the  numbers were damaged by two things one was the tier  diagnostics for legacy products that i mentioned we did not expect to take a  million to  million haircut in that space but we saw generic competition come in early in the year and it continues to be problematic and we have also seen panels coming in where instead of the doctor ordering a test for a single target or two targets the doctor orders a panel that does  or  assays in the panel the reimbursement is off the scale for that so far reimbursement has been somewhat variable with some thirdparty payers paying and others protesting loudly so we think thats going to sort out but that’s still an area of concern for us the other parts of the business are fairly durable as you could imagine there has been a lot of competition in molecular and in molecular you have companies that are probably winding down and because of that they are i use the term reckless in some of their marketing strategies where they are going for lowest possible prices free pieces of capital equipment anything to be able to come to wall street and say i just got another  customers so they can raise more money and they can stay alive so molecular has been a very hot area of interest its obviously a focus area for us but i believe that i’m confident saying that meridian and sofie had held their average selling prices worth of  a test in molecular whereas we have seen a number of these younger companies coming in anywhere from the  to  per test and for many of them which rely upon capital equipment they are probably selling at an overall loss just to be able to get a toe hold catherine sazdanoff okay and c diff has been a substantial revenue component for you guys historically where do you envision that market unfolding over the next few years so pricing dynamics experience is that still an area of growth for you john kraeutler c diff is an interesting area our first c diff products were launched in the late s and we have had a commanding market share since that time but when molecular came into c difficile which was about six years ago we were the only existing company that had significant market share close to  million and see c difficile that had to flip much of that business to molecular so one of the things you don’t see over the last five or six years is we have actually back filled about  million of c difficile business that was being done by immunoassay thats now being done by molecular so today our c difficile business is hanging in at around  million we are optimistic that we might be able to get a couple of points of growth out of it but its a very diversified part of the business where about  of the dollars are in molecular but the other  are in the old immunoassays and we are the only company that offers the full armamentarium of tests either immunoassay or molecular but is it a growth area no catherine sazdanoff and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that h pylori patent expired in may haven’t seen increased competition there yet what actions are you taking to combat potential increased competition in the future and may be talk about the market dynamics for testing that would be centralized and where that’s headed john kraeutler sure our h pylori business began around   and prior to that doctors were running a rapid screening test for antibody to see if a person had ever been exposed to h pylori but it didn’t tell you whether you had an active infection so our patented product was a test for active infection it was a stool based assay that would tell the doctors this person has the h pylori bacteria in their gut the recommendation at that point was to test treat eradicative infection a lot of market development went into it and it grew to be than a  million category about six or seven years ago we began to have competition in europe and our growth rate in europe slowed from around  to down to  or  because price pressures et cetera et cetera so our unit market share has held up nicely in europe but prices have come down rapidly in that market in the us we were protected through may of this year by our patent and we expected that european competitors that we have been fighting against were going to show up in the us market to this point none have come into the united states market we still expect them but its allowed us to do a couple of things one is to build a very defensive posture where our existing customers are doing lots of the longer term contracts we are you would see talked about centralized versus decentralized we do have rapid assays that work in  minutes we have been able to decentralize a lot of the testing to hospitals and clinics and as you diversify your customer base obviously your target becomes more difficult to hit but its also allowed us to build an offensive string and what i mean by that is we have had another new product in the category approved by the fda earlier this year and we just started marketing asr analyte specific reagent for clarithromycin resistance h pylori so this would be a premium diagnostic that tells the doctor not only does the patient has h pylori but also is it resistant to clarithromycin which is usually one of the topline drugs that’s prescribed for eradicating there is a third product in development so that would probably see the light in the middle of  which is a combination product of h pylori diagnostics and something else that we think is material to detect in a stool sample so we are not caviler about it as i said we expect next year a  growth rate is probably appropriate we hope that we can do better than that but there is no reason to be bullish in the guidance when we are facing potential competition i will say that our largest competitor which is not unusual is a doctor that treats empirically for stomach pain and the doctor prescribes an nexium or zantac and never worries about whether there is a bacteria in your gut and this bacteria happens to a class question again so later in life when you get stomach cancer remember that when you were  years old your doctor put you on zantac or nexium and you took that your entire life and now the bacteria has done its job catherine sazdanoff and then if you go back over the last year you have launched ctng hsv you talked about malaria can you talk about how those are progressing as you have been pleased with the launches and if you had to take one and what your more excited about john kraeutler great question illumigene which is our molecular platform because illumigene doesn’t require a capital investment on the customers’ part we find that we conclude assets on the system that are relatively low volume but very high value to the laboratory so each of the products you mentioned is very different chlamydia and gonorrhea our feeling was in the united states the market was wellserved by large automated companies because with chlamydia and gonorrhea you are talking about primarily screening testing making up mostly the volume as oppose to what i would consider diagnostic testing diagnostic meaning somebody who suspects that they chlamydia or gonorrhea versus somewhat who is being screened as either a part of wellness or it’s a prenatal workup or something of that type so we said we are stay away from that because the fda wants  million to  million worth of clinical trials to be run to be approved in united states we said but we have got  illumigene customers in europe and chlamydia and gonorrhea would be a great side core product for people that already have the system so actually is doing well but we are talking about hundreds of thousands for dollars herpes  and  is one of those products that its appeal is that about  of laboratories in united states don’t do any herpes testing they send them out and in today’s world where hospital ceos and hospital boards have purchased physician offices they have built satellite clinics they have added new wings on their hospitals they are star for revenue so a send out diagnostic is a revenue opportunity if they can bring that inhouse so the herpes products are actually kicking the door open meaning for us it allows new placements of illumigene and then as you might expect with  products on the platform if you open the door with herpes very often you can get two to three other assays to be brought in at the same time often when we get new c difficile customer it’s not because we have opened them up for c difficile but we have opened them for hoping whooping cough or herpes or something else the one that im most excited about i think is malaria because malaria has done couple of things for us number one is the first illumigene molecular assay that’s done on blood every other one is done on either stool or swabs or wounds or some odd specimen and the amount of malaria in the world is just enormous million children die every year malaria has two distinct markets one is the traveler market these are people who are residents of europe but they were probably born in an endemic area and they go back and forth and when they showup in europe again with a low fever they need to be tested right away so again we have an existing base of customers the addition of malaria onto those customers has been very routine for us hundreds of thousands of dollars this year probably close to a million dollars going into next year but the real opportunities how to i get into senegal and sierra leone et cetera and we have had great  in fact we just won a award for the most innovative malaria diagnostic or treatment in the last year and the issue here is you have to get into the bureaucracy you have to get your product embedded approved put on the list and then dollars have to be appealed for so malaria is going to be maybe mid to late  in terms of large purchases coming out of the endemic areas but we think it’s going to happen malaria has also opened up a brand new strategic category for us that begin as we called that mosquitoborne or tropical diseases but now it’s been reidentified as insight vector diseases which allows us to get into line lyme kingella which causes pediatric arthritis in the joints so here illumigene is going to be used on joint fluid which is called synovial fluid and begin to see this very and you begin to see this very broad diversified platform thats capable of doing almost any infectious disease diagnostic on any type of sample catherine sazdanoff okay and then you talked about adding about three to five tests per year just wondering if you could paint a picture for the future pipeline anything in there that is faced through and then how to you think about adding in test for areas in that test field going forward  john kraeutler sure i want to be respectful of this forum we tend not to signal where we are going too far in the future because there are many of our competitors that are taking a different tact when they are looking at market opportunities they tend to look at where is the highest volume and then we are going after that high volume what we tend to do is look for the markets that we believe we can help emerge and i think the insect vector is a very very good one so insect vector takes you into malaria takes you into zika we can do zika on illumigene we can also do zika in immunoassay because we believe the market is going to bifurcate and i dont know if bifurcate is a world but they will be screening for zika immunity they will be screening for zika in blood units and they will be screening for zika diagnostic i think zika diagnostic will be the smallest volume so thats an opportunity and then things like for babesia which is a tickborne disease that is often associated with suspicion of lyme disease and those of you that are in the new york are long island will be  many of the large institutions on long island are trying to start there bcf screening in january and we are in early with prototype products so we think that could be very appealing and then the kingella bacteria that i mentioned before is also tickborne and the childrens hospitals that are trying to diagnose arthritis in children are extremely excited about this this is anecdotal but the childrens hospital will usually try to culture the organism from synovial fluid and their accuracy rate is about  so in the studies that we have done we have got an  of the babesia infections so we believe this can be not only a very viable market for us but it also helps to define what meridian is all about catherine sazdanoff okay and then before we wrap up with the last question ill change gears and move at your margin so far i think thats an attractive piece of meridian so if you could talk about your integrating molecular manufacturing inhouse how that improves margins and then what else you are doing to drive manufacturing efficiency john kraeutler sure sure i mentioned before that very often when we acquire we will acquire things and have a lower margin profile and then it takes us three to five years to bring them up to a level thats comparable to what the meridian investor is looking for when it came to molecular our job was to get illumigene into the market as fast as possible and we used a number of outside partners to get that done which became expensive we spent  million i guess it’s three years ago now to build our own on campus molecular manufacturing facility and the savings on that at  revenue rates was about  million a year so as illumigene sales go up that number continues to improve so to illumigene which had margins in the mids now is up around   there is another program that we reviewed yesterday morning which has the potential to save another  million on illumigene it will probably take us two to three years to get through that but i think the point catherine is constant focus on driving cost down the molecular space has had the luxury of having higher reimbursements in the united states but we are expecting that there is going to be broadbrush approaches to reimbursement and molecular is going to be a very opportunistic target so we want to make sure that our manufacturing costs are the lowest in the industry catherine sazdanoff okay and then one big picture question to wrap it up when you look at meridian five years from now be it magellan your appetite for additional ma how you plan to expand globally and what does meridian looks like five years from now john kraeutler i think that all i would tell an investor today is organic growth in the  to  range is something that we think we can manage at our current size and our current investment profile we do acquire and we have never leveraged our balance sheet up until this year when we brought magellan we have spent some time talking about what is our capacity with the bankers and also a little bit with the public markets we havent come to you and tried to raise money in quite a while but we think we have got  million to  million of easily accessible capital and as long as we follow our formula we should be in good shape so if you take  million business and you bandwidth it at  growth versus  growth that gives you what the core is and then another couple  million should buy us another  million to  million of revenue going forward very very rough numbers but we have done this for  years we are not trying to convince everybody we are going to double next year but if we can convince people that we can grow it  to  continue to pay a dividend and be smart with our acquisition dollars i think we will satisfy a lot of investors catherine sazdanoff with that thank you
