comparable gaap measures is available in our earnings release i will now turn the call over to the president and ceo of carrols restaurant group dan accordino daniel t accordino thanks paul and good morning everyone we consider our third quarter performance respectable in light of the general weakness in consumer spending during the period heightened competition within qsr throughout the year and a difficult prior year comparable sales comparison of  third quarter comparable restaurant sales increased  on an overall basis including an increase of  at our legacy restaurants and a  increase at our restaurants acquired in may  on a full year basis comparable sales were up a solid  reflecting the success of burger king initiatives aimed at widening the overall appeal of the brand burger king continues to focus on a balanced marketing approach offering value oriented products at multiple price points to drive traffic while highlighting premium offerings on a limited time basis for both brand and check building we believe that effective promotion of both value and premium products has been key to our maintaining positive sales momentum in the face of increased competition and economic pressures in terms of value third quarter promotions included the  for  mix and match special a newly introduced french fries burger and a  small ice cream cone among others on the premium side burger king launched its new buffalo chicken strips and featured a premium chicken parmesan sandwich we also saw the return of the angry whopper and an expanded summer barbecue menu which included a memphis pulled pork bbq sandwich the carolina bbq whopper and chicken sandwiches a new rib sandwich and a bbq chicken salad in late september burger king launched its innovative new betterforyou french fries called satisfries that contained  less fat and  fewer calories than mcdonalds french fries while not compromising on taste the media buzz around this product launch was robust and initial customer response has been positive our incidence of customers ordering french fries has also increased since the rollout in terms of our third quarter performance we increased adjusted ebitda by  despite a modest  decline in restaurant sales i just pointed out that while comparable restaurant sales increased  total sales were down slightly compared to last year due to our closing of eight restaurants over the past  months the improvement in adjusted ebitda which excludes certain integration costs related to the acquisition and eeoc litigation costs from last year reflected an almost  improvement in restaurant level ebitda due to increased profitability of the acquired restaurants this was partially offset by increases in our ga expense due to higher bonus expense this year and a reduction in payments from fiesta restaurant group as they continue to transition certain support services following last years stop restaurant level ebitda which is adjusted ebitda before ga expense increased from  million in the third quarter of last year to  million and excluding last years integration cost increased  million or  restaurant level ebitda at our legacy restaurants was essentially unchanged on a yearoveryear basis and margins remained strong at  restaurant level ebitda at the acquired restaurants increased  million in total and by  million excluding the integration cost from last year restaurant level ebitda margin at the acquired restaurants increased more than  basis points compared to the third quarter of last year and after excluding the integration cost increased by over  basis points this reflects the operating improvements that weve made over the past year that we see in our pl results our operational improvements and our customer satisfaction scores sequentially the margin gap to our legacy restaurants widened about  basis points from the second quarter this primarily reflected to the negative leverage in our fixed cost due to the sequential decrease in sales from the second to third quarter while operations have improved as i indicated in the last call our sales performance at the acquired restaurants has been muted by the performance of certain markets where sales trends for the brand have been softer namely virginia in the third quarter comparable restaurant sales were down  in our  virginia restaurants given their location we believe that the virginia sales decline was at least partially due to the impending us government shutdown and the effects of those sequestered however the performance in this market has been more than offset by positive sales trends in almost every other acquired market sales at the  north carolina restaurants increased  for the quarter we were also up  in dayton  in philadelphia and  in louisville although our presence is smaller with only  to  restaurants in each of these markets turning to our ongoing remodeling efforts we considered the remodeling of  restaurants during the first nine months of the year bringing the total number of units upgraded to the  design image to over  for the full year we are on pace to remodel a total of  to  restaurants in  and well conclude the year with approximately  of all our units remodelled to new image to conclude i would characterize the third quarter as respectable under the circumstances comparable restaurant sales increased  marking the ninth consecutive quarter of positive growth while sales gains were modest in the face of economic and consumer pressures we were able to maintain margins at our legacy restaurants despite higher promotional activity this year as i said we have made considerable operational and pl improvements for the acquired units over the past year in october sales trends reaccelerated and our comparable restaurant sales increased  for the month we expect that sequentially sales trends will be better in the fourth quarter as reflected in our updated guidance with that ill now turn the call back over to paul to continue our financial review paul r flanders thanks dan restaurant sales decreased  to  million in the third quarter from  million last year the higher comparable restaurant sales were offset by eight fewer restaurants in operation at the end of the third quarter of this year legacy restaurants generated  million in sales compared to  million last year and the acquired restaurants generated  million in sales compared to  million in the same period last year comparable restaurant sales increased  on an overall basis compared to  in the year ago period including an increase of  in legacy restaurants and a  increase in acquired restaurants average check was  lower due to the higher promotional activity and was more than offset by the increase in customer traffic of  average weekly sales for the acquired restaurants were  and increased  from the third quarter of last year this increase was net of an approximate  reduction from the elimination of  hour operations in many of the acquired restaurants during the second and third quarters last year average sales of the acquired restaurants were  lower than our legacy restaurants this difference widened sequentially due to seasonality differences between the acquired and legacy restaurants namely differences between the northern and southern restaurants adjusted ebitda was  million in the third quarter compared to  million in the prior year and adjusted ebitda margin was  in the quarter compared to  last year as dan said the improvement in adjusted ebitda reflected a  increase in adjusted restaurant level ebitda at the acquired restaurants partially offset by certain increases in our ga expense restaurant level ebitda margins were  of legacy restaurants essentially the same as the third quarter last year on flat revenues cost of sales improved  basis points as favorable sales mix changes offset higher promotional discounting and modest commodity increase however restaurant labor costs increased  basis points in the quarter mainly due to higher unemployment tax rate and workers compensation costs restaurant level ebitda at the acquired restaurants is adjusted to exclude  million of integration cost incurred last year increased  million to  million adjusted restaurant level ebitda margins were  and improved  basis points from the third quarter last year as we leveraged a number of expense items most notably a  basis point reduction in cost of sales you can find supplemental data and our restaurant level operating expenses in todays earnings release general and administrative expenses were  million or  of sales in the third quarter and decreased  million compared to third quarter last year ga cost in the third quarter last year included  million of expenses related to our litigation with the eeoc that we settled earlier this year and  million in integration cost related to the acquisition depreciation and amortization expense increased from  million in the third quarter last year to  million this year due primarily to remodeling initiatives over the past year interest expense was  million in the third quarter compared to  million last year the net loss from continuing operations was  million or  per diluted share including impairment charges of  million or  per diluted share after tax this compares to a net loss from continuing operations of  million in the prior year or  per diluted share which included integration costs related to the acquisition and eeoc litigation cost of  million in total or  per share after tax at the end of the quarter our cash balances were  million including  million of restricted cash held as collateral for our revolving credit facility total outstanding debt was  million at quarter end essentially unchanged from last quarter capital expenditures for the third quarter of  totaled  million including  million for restaurant remodeling total capital expenditures for the nine months were  million  remodels were completed in the quarter and  restaurants have been remodelled so far this year  finally we are updating our guidance for  in view of our results yeartodate we are making some slight adjustments to our restaurant sales expectations total restaurant sales and now expected to be in the  million to  million range compared to  million to  million previously overall comparable restaurant sales are anticipated to be between  and  in the fourth quarter commodity costs are still expected to increase  to  for the year ga is expected to be approximately  million excluding stock compensation costs and we plan to close approximately  restaurants this year of which we have already closed eight our annual effective income tax rate is estimated to be between  and  including the carryover benefit of the  wotc credits that were mostly recognized in the first quarter and lastly capital expenditures are projected to add  million to  million for  versus  million to  million previously and includes  million to  million in remodeling a total of  to  restaurants our estimated remodeling expenditures include  million for the relocation of two restaurants to new sites and for cost to scrape and rebuild four restaurants excluding the two new restaurants and the relocations the remodels are generally still expected to average about  for the year that concludes our prepared remarks and with that well now open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from bryan hunt from wells fargo securities please state your question bryan hunt  wells fargo securities i was wondering if someone could comment on the samestore sales acceleration in q do you think its more of a reflection of general consumer sentiment or reactions to marketing and product changes especially like the satisfries daniel t accordino this is dan i would say bryan that it certainly is more in terms of the marketing calendar satisfries certainly has added a certain excitement around the brand we sell only about ph  satisfries a day and more importantly it has increased our overall fry incidence by  a day so it’s been somewhat incremental furthermore i think that the burger king recalibrating the marketing calendar to be more valueoriented this  for  promotion is working very well and burger king is using the  for  platform to introduce or change out various products which has been very successful and we saw that in september and certainly this is a trend thats carried into october bryan hunt  wells fargo securities the next question about sales i mean when you look in october as well as – is there anything ph you can tell us about virginia in particular i mean you called it out in terms of being really negative for q how about q is it – has the tempo of samestore sales there changed daniel t accordino i think that they are seeing a bit of a rebound similar to what we are seeing across the balance of the markets but they are certainly still the softest market that we have the north neck has got  restaurants one of those restaurants was down  plus percent in the third quarter and its still continuing in the fourth quarter because there is no road in front of the restaurant which is indiscernible that store in and of itself has over  percentage share point effect on the entire north neck market were in the process of now remodeling some of those restaurants and i think that were going to start seeing a little bit of traction but i met with burger king last week and we are certainly going to with them because its not just a carrols phenomena its the whole entire dma indiscernible purpose on it in terms of how we are going to market that – the virginia market in  bryan hunt  wells fargo securities okay and then two more questions and one is a housekeeping theres been a lot of talk at least in bkc worldwide about the performance of remodelled stores as i think about your remodeled stores the number you already completed  to  this year and a  sales lift i mean in round figures that should contribute – and looking what you did as well in  in round figures it should contribute call it  million to  million to sales growth next year does that map work in your mind or does that make sense paul r flanders yes your numbers are close we have seen about  lift in the first year and i think we are expecting a couple  in the subsequent year as well and obviously we have a lot of good positive momentum in those stores that have been remodeled bryan hunt  wells fargo securities okay and then my last question and again housekeeping could you tell me the number of legacy versus acquired stores that are in the portfolio paul r flanders yes i think at the end of the third quarter there were  legacy restaurants  acquired restaurants bryan hunt  wells fargo securities thank you very much ill get back in the queue operator the next question comes from james fronda from sidoti  co please state your question james fronda  sidoti  co can you just talk about i guess anticipated store closures for  daniel t accordino i think in general relative to  we are going to provide more guidance obviously on the next call we are doing the process of putting our plans and so forth together now but our expectation is probably were going to have probably  to  stores that he will close next year james fronda  sidoti  co okay and i guess is there any way you can give a forecasted capex for  or is it still the same daniel t accordino too early james fronda  sidoti  co okay alright thanks guys operator operator instructions we have a followup question from bryan hunt from wells fargo securities please state your question bryan hunt  wells fargo securities are the  to  stores that are to be closed in  are those ebitda negative stores or would it be safe to assume that daniel t accordino maybe thats there ph bryan hunt  wells fargo securities is there any way you could quantify the magnitude of losses of those stores daniel t accordino not today we will give some guidance on that in the next call primarily bryan the restaurants are being closed in  when we negotiated this deal with burger king they were stores that we had identified that were either slightly ebitda positive or slightly ebitda negative and we agreed at the time that we did the transaction to keep those restaurants open for two years to see if we could make a difference so those are really the restaurants we are talking about bryan hunt  wells fargo securities okay very good next i mean burger king has mentioned that there are two more focused product launches in q in the portfolio is there any way you can give us kind of a preview on how those products may compare to satisfries in terms of the marketing push and the relative price point daniel t accordino i think that the best way to answer that is that the products that are being viewed in the fourth quarter one will be a modification to the value menu and the other will be introduced as part of the  for  promotion bryan hunt  wells fargo securities alright very good and then lastly i mean paul if you look at kind of the outlook for next year and the anticipated capex would you expect to be in a position to burn cash again in  paul r flanders as i said were putting our plans together now and lets see how the fourth quarter shapes up and how the economy improves here to get a sense of what – before we get a good sense of what  looks like having said that i think our intention would be to continue to do the remodels obviously we probably are going to burn some cash doing that and i think our sense is probably until we see how  is shaping up we might slow the pace down a little bit as we go in the beginning of the year bryan hunt  wells fargo securities very good i appreciate your time thank you operator there appears to be no further questions please continue with any points you wish to raise daniel t accordino we don’t really have anything else to add we appreciate everybody joining us today and look forward to talking to you after the fourth quarter thank you operator thank you this
