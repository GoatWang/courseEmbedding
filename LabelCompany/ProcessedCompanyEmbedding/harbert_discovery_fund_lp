   third avenue north suite  birmingham alabama  t    f   wwwharbertnet     november   dr lawrence howard chairman of the board of directors icad inc  spit brook road suite  nashua nh  usa dear chairman howard harbert discovery fund hdf owns  of icad inc the company or icad common shares we maintain strong belief in icads potential but are troubled by its recent performance we feel management should take steps to attempt to restore shareholder confidence accordingly in this letter we call on the companys board of directors the board and management team to purchase shares immediately in the open market waive board cash compensation until there is a material improvement in operational performance and to pursue strategic alternatives should the business not experience a material improvement in revenue growth and business outlook by q  as longterm oriented shareholders we see significant value in icad in both the cancer therapy and cancer detection segments the company has promising technology in its cancer therapy segment with the xoft system indeed the strong positive clinical data released at the american society for radiation oncology astro meeting in  reinforced the clinical efficacy and systemic cost advantages of this emerging cancer therapy platform as indicated on the last earnings call the potential for  ebx skin customers in the therapy segment by the end of  is also very promising in the nearterm longerterm we are pleased to hear of the potential applications of the xoft system in prostate cancer and other indications representing additional significant market opportunities equally important the tomosynthesis computeraided detection solution and workflow tool d cad is already showing strong promise in europe where it is commercially available we remain very encouraged by the strong reader study data submitted to the fda earlier in the year and we are hopeful that the product will ultimately be approved by the fda the installed business awaiting this d cad product as well as the potential for the next generation product presents a compelling opportunity to be a technology leader and firstmover in breast tomosynthesis and cancer detection despite these promising developments the most recent quarterly earnings released on november   were highly disappointing hdf feels these earnings reflect neither the revenue generation potential of the business nor the characteristics of strong operational execution with shares trading around share we feel it is incumbent on the board and management team to immediately purchase common shares in the open market common shares are down  over the past year and down  since september  and this follows the very challenged  stock performance and reimbursement debacle given the strong growth potential in both business segments icads current enterprise value of x our  sales expectations puts the company at a steep discount to peers and its considerable market opportunity after the pattern of mismanaged shareholder expectations and poor performance shareholders are reluctant to place credence in managements guidance and the boards oversight open market purchases of shares would signal faith in the business and the potential for  to be a transformative year hdf also feels the suspension of board cash compensation until icad has shown multiple quarters of sustained improved performance would be a sign to shareholders that the board understands the recent value deterioration and is committed to reversing that trend finally the board should make it a nearterm priority to hire a highquality chief financial officer cfo importantly looking into next year hdf feels that should icad not receive fda approval for its d cad product or demonstrate revenue growth potential by q then the board should hire an investment bank and immediately explore a range of strategic alternatives including the sale of each segment independently it is highly likely given the standalone ebitda characteristics of both business segments that there would be motivated and interested buyers consider that a sumof theparts analysis suggests the cancer detection business alone could be worth more than the enterprise value of the company today and that does not even account for the revenue potential of the d cad product we remain confident that  will be a transformative year for icad the board and management team should immediately purchase shares on the open market to demonstrate their shared confidence in icads future as well as to help restore confidence among the investor community also we implore the board to move swiftly to improve the management team by hiring a firstrate cfo should the company continue to struggle in  the board should engage an investment bank to explore strategic alternatives hdf is optimistic icad can capitalize on the opportunities before it to improve performance should meaningful progress not be made however hdf will consider taking actions to drive change and prevent further value erosion for all icad stakeholders we would welcome the opportunity to discuss any of our points at length thank you for your consideration sincerely s jack bryant jack bryant director of investments and coportfolio manager of harbert discovery fund gp llc the general partner of harbert discovery fund lp s kenan lucas kenan
