creating eproducts  a guide  workbook — nora conrad back shop library podcast faq  contact back join dashboard courses problog workshops past workshops resources facebook group make things happen by turning dreams into actions and using the best business productivity tools to get organized creating eproducts  a guide  workbook what are eproductseproducts are any digital projects sold online this can be downloadable content like a pdf or an information product like an online course ebooksregular books are still incredibly popular but with the help of the internet anyone can write and publish an ebook for free ebooks are a fantastic way to share what you know in a unique format i give away  ebooks when someone signs up for my email listworkbooksthese are very similar to ebooks but workbooks are usually fillable pdfs or printable sheets that are meant to be answered and written on workbooks are created for planning and helping your audience get their ideas on paper or on screen workbooks are one of my favorite resources for planning projectsecoursesthese have become crazy popular over the last few years ecourses can range from free email courses like mariah cozs to a fullblown course with a community videos downloads and articles im working on a few ecourses right nowvideo seriesvideos are usually a part of another package but you can use a video series as a standalone product where to sellthere is a ton of options when it comes to online marketplaces i want to highlight  popular options for entrepreneurs and small businesses keep in mind you can use more than one of these i have products on my squarespace site and on etsy reaching different markets can make a huge difference in your salessquarespaceif you have a squarespace site you can use the ecommerce feature to build a shop right into your website i have my own shop on this site having your shop on your own website offers a considerable advantage because youre wont be paying additional fees to sell your items get dpddigital product delivery dpd is quickly becoming a popular marketplace for freelancers to sell their digital products customization flat monthly fees and security features are just a few of the options available to users if you want to start off on the right foot dpd is a fantastic optioncreative market if you sell photography fonts or other graphics creative market has a fantastic customer base you can quickly create an account and start selling with cm the downside is they take a percentage of your sales which can be a pretty large chunk if youre selling a lotetsyone of the most popular marketplaces but not the best there are very few options for branding and customization if you dont have a website etsy is a great choice however if you have a selfhosted site youd be better off with dpd or ss commercethink of an ideayou dont have to be an expert to write an ebook or create an ecourse there is always someone who knows less than you if youve made earrings before youre one step ahead of someone who wants to make earrings that makes you the expertwhen you want to make a product make a list of things you know how to do this can be as simple as baking a scone to something much more involved like website development if you know how to do it you can teach someone else make a list of your hobbies skills and talents once you have that list write a book or course idea next to each one for example one of my hobbies is running i could write an ebook about running techniques when you have a list of ideas begin by crossing off anything youre not interested in now pick one and move on to the next step a brain dumpyou can print out the product planner below to use my outline get the outline sign up with your email address to download the outline right now email address download thank you click here to download your outline create your productheres the part most people dread creating your product does not have to be hard make a plan set a schedule and commit whether youre writing an ebook or creating a full ecourse the process is generally the same heres a look at the steps i take when creating a new productbrain dump mind mapwrite down anything and everything that pops into your brain and began creating a mind map write everything you know on the topic and anything you need to research dont worry about how messy random or silly it seemsoutlineusing your mind map create an outline for your product you might find you have enough ideas for more than one product make each idea a chapter or section and add bullet points for detailswritetake  minutes   minutes every day to write dont worry about images formatting or other content just get those ideas down i use ms word or evernote for this stepeditwhen you have most of the writing finished you can edit it fix your text add additional content proofread and add more details have another person proofread it as well you can also add formatting at this pointdesigncreate the cover or graphics for your product start advertising it and getting people excited on your upcoming workeditread through the entire thing edit and reedit until its perfectfinalize  publishpublish your content you can use ms word pages indesign canva or publisher to create a welldesigned ebook or course save it in pdf format or publish it on amazon or lulu marketing your productnow that youve finished your product you need to get it out to the world decide if youll be giving it away for free or if youll be selling itif youll be selling your product you want to make sure you give away valuable content relating to the topic this will help customers see you as an expertif youre giving something away for free you can use that to generate followers or an audience social mediai use buffer to schedule my social media posts this way i can create  posts at once and schedule them a few days apart this makes it super easy to plan your content and keep
