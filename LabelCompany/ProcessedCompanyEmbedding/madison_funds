mobile view   madison funds madison investment funds the idea of madison investment funds came into being when its founders identified promising investment opportunities within several sectors of the cyprus economy in conjunction with its competitive advantage being a regional investment hub this was a result of the traditional attractive business environment of cyprus and the highest level of available professional services and the continuous growth for the last twenty plus years read more reliable transparent operation we are proud of our work ethic we deliver only the very best investment opportunities read more efficient effective services we stand by our clients everytime and everywhere it matters read more the investment fund the diversified nature of investment opportunities in the local as well as international market called for the establishment of such an investment vehicle geared towards a wide base of professional investors with varying risk and economic profiles our priority was the common expectation of investors for transparency efficiency effectiveness capital growth wealth maximization a clear exit route as well as the distribution of profits in a way that would ensure the most beneficial tax treatment in order to meet the above goals we reached the conclusion that our investment fund should operate under a strictly regulated environment which would meet investor expectations while allowing investors to choose tailormade investment portfolios matching their unique individual profiles and expectations as the issues above are mainly addressed by the cyprus registered alternative investment fund with a limited number of persons “aiflnp” we incorporated madison funds under its regulatory framework
