latest trends in video streaming technologydo you ever experience difficulties streaming video on your phone or computer the way video is delivered to your device is evolving and tackling many of the frustrations you encounter when streaming online check out how jwplayer netflix and wowza media systems are pioneering video streaming technology and delivering you the highest quality video recommendation algorithms deepwalkdo you ever feel netflix suggests videos irrelevant to your interests video recommendation algorithms have existed in parallel to netflix since the early ’s but jw player utilizes a new algorithm called deepwalk to make more accurate suggestions deepwalk allows for factors other than viewing behavior to influence recommendations and works by learning content asymmetrically think of videos as points on a graph and each video is weighted by watch frequency and recency most recommendation algorithms correlate video a with video b and likewise video b with video a however deepwalk correlates video a with video b but not the other way around because the algorithm learns asymmetrically and doesn’t solely rely on user viewing behavior it can incorporate other factors to make more accurate suggestions such as video and user metadata pertitle encoding optimization despite it’s sometimes inaccurate video recommendations netflix engineered an algorithm to deliver users the highest quality video without using unnecessary streaming bandwidth instead of spitting out all videos using the same number of bits netflix developed a system called “pertitleencoding optimization” it works by analyzing video titles to determine the their complexity for example videos with fastmoving action scenes require more bits to stream than animation or landscape scenes encoding optimization ensures you receive the highest quality video at the most efficient output  low latency streaming have you ever received a notification on your phone about the score of a game before seeing it on tv the challenge with live video streaming is there’s always a delay  often reaching into the double digits most streaming platforms use apple hls to minimize delay it works by breaking the stream into small http files and delivering them in a sequence but a platform developed by wowza media systems provides video streaming to users with only milliseconds of delay it delivers live video in real time by working with an opensource api project called web real time communication rtc the systems allow the stream to synchronize important aspects of live video such as commentary scores and updates it’s becoming an emerging standard in video streaming and soon you’ll know the score of the game on tv before it reaches your phonegamechanging video streaming trends are hitting the market and alleviating many frustrations for users although these technologies are working from the back end of your favorite platforms they’re sure to improve the quality of what you see on your tv computer or mobile device    wouldn’t it be cool if…during my time at uga i had a professor who would start lectures quite frequently with “wouldn’t it be cool if…” as we’ve wrapped up our time last week in barcelona with mobile world congress i can’t seem to shake that familiar phase from my head wouldn’t it be cool if…mobile world congress has answered many of the “if” moments with technology and applications that enable far beyond possible  as we watch technologies like a headset that sensing brain activity to help train patients towards gaining focus and decreasing stress or a sensory substitution device that translates digital information in gentle stimulation patterns to allow blind people understand their surroundings we begin to understand that mobile isn’t just about the device in our pockets it’s about empowering consumers to connect with the world around them so where do we go from here as we think about mobile strategies for  and beyond we’ve reached a tipping point where the internet of things may finally start to unfold into real and tangible applications  and that’s exciting we plan to challenge ourselves and our clients to take those “wouldn’t it be cool if…” moments and find ways to bring them to life across a marketing ecosystem fueled by mobility     animating d sprites with d geometryby michael stanley art directorhere in the studio we’ve started playing with some new tools and a new workflow for animating d sprites with d geometry “why would you do that” you might ask by using d meshes to animate our sprites we can achieve some really nice animations across the board we can squash stretch skew and deform to achieve very smooth animation cycles without having a ton of geometry or sprite sheets we also aren’t limited to basic boned animation which tends to look very primitive and puppetlike you can check out how this was done with lovers in a dangerous spacetime in this really awesome timelapse video so here’s how we found out how to get it to work with autodesk maya lt and scenekitwe are still playing around to see if this is the best workflow for us but it looks promising to say the least we’re all excited to see what kind of polish we can achieve in our animations with a process like this    hours in barcelona mobile world congress  so farwe’re nearly two days into barcelona and as expected so far mobile world congress has left us inspired inquisitive and still asking “how did they do that”while the sheer amount of technology is electrifying on the expo floor it’s the stories behind each of those products that we’re taking home a few surprising standouts so far personalization has its limits i have to admit it’s a bit surprising yet quite refreshing to hear personalization talked about so intimately across the board here at mwc while we’ve heard unanimously in recent years about the push to create more personal hyper relevant experiences balancing data with the pushback of going too far is intriguing as one panelist put it  you can still create an experience without telling me about it hyperconnected doesn’t have to mean “connect all of the things” products stand a purpose and so do the actions we natively take with them keeping in mind the context around a user’s behavior allows us to better map the journey sometimes this will mean partnering objects apps or devices while at other times it may be best to keep them separate an excellent example of this is linkedin’s diverse app strategy with a series of apps that each serve a clear and distinct purpose linkedin has built tools that serve the customer when they need them will they use every app everyday no and that’s ok  let’s move past “because it’s cool” there is no shortage of cool technology here at mwc and believe me we’re loving it the expo floor is inspiring and it sets an incredible foundation for the future however as specific markets begin to expand asking questions is key pebble is taking a fresh look at the context they can add around a person’s life without forcing them to break their habits with the launch of pebble time steel swarovski is launching a new line in partnership with misfit and putting fashion at its core giving balance to fashion and function both examples of a market we’ve watched explode in wearables and are now seeing mature in exciting ways    applying game personas in mobile marketing personal motivationmobile games have cracked the code on creating meaningful user engagement something marketers have struggled with creating in mobile experiences one method to rethinking how to approach the design of those experiences is by the application of gaming personas to the development process by matching these game personas against certain game mechanics in your design you are better enabled to influence users to take desired actions complete goals and interact with others this is the second entry in our three part series on applying game personas to the design of mobile experiences personal motivation traditionally marketers identify specific target segments and then attempt to strategize the audience’s needs and desires in an effort to design a campaign or message that has the greatest chance of being effective because gaming personas rely on an actual test of engagement guessing is taken out of the equation at its core the most simple motivator to play a game is for enjoyment as we start to better understand how we can fulfill consumer needs we open ourselves to building more meaningful experiences with no motive other than to please the userby applying this same theory to our marketing mix we force ourselves to start with the question what does my consumer need in order to feel fulfilled this is quite different from the typical approach taken by marketers what do i want my consumer to do on behalf of my brand our approach designs for humans not functions marketers are then free to concentrate on more powerful and more personal engagement mechanisms mobile games are purposefully designed to allow an audience to engage in a way that empowers their individual style of interaction this individual style is categorized not through conventional sociodemographic means but by the interaction triggers which create engagement make sure you didn’t miss the first entry in our series universal use stay tuned to the blog or follow dragon army on facebook and twitter to stay updated as we continue our series on applying gaming personas to mobile marketing   the chipotle scarecrow moving beyond marketing gimmickswe’re more than a year removed from the launch of chipotle’s back to the start campaign which featured the popular film and game “the scarecrow” a recent reminder found at some local chipotle restaurants last month put the campaign back into focus…and back into many of the conversations around gaming our team has been having with clients as marketers it’s in our dna to pick apart commercials campaigns and even games to find the golden nugget to adapt as our own so why did “the scarecrow” work and why are we still talking about it more than a year later here’s a hint  it doesn’t have to do with the massive success of the mobile gaming industry alone “the scarecrow” was a success because it goes deep into the brand ethos of chipotle the campaign wasn’t a gimmick or an idea crafted alone in the marketing department it’s a true manifestation of the commitment they’ve made as a brand brought to life “the scarecrow” worked because every chapter and channel in the brand story connects back to that ethos giving it reallife power even down to the example seen in stores this january with the pork supplier as marketers the deeper we dive into mobile gaming insert any new platform name here the harder we will need to work towards telling an authentic brand narrative first telling stories people care about creates a connection to the brand by leading with compelling stories we can more easily build those digital experiences that people will actually want to engage with    applying game personas in mobile marketing universal useas we mentioned in our post on “marketing in a mobile driven world” the gaming community has been effective at solving a challenge which marketers have struggled in creating with mobile experiences  engagement mobile games convert into engagement in part because of a unique concentration on gaming personas these personas identify players as a certain type of gamer with a set of motivators behavioral tendencies and action triggers gaming personas match up against potential game mechanics that are designed to encourage each user type to take desired actions complete goals and interact with other players we have identified three key benefits to marketers for applying gaminginspired personas to mobile experiences let’s take a closer look at the first benefit in our series  universal use the techniques used for creating gaming personas have an interesting side effect  they all but eliminate the traditional use of demographics to create personas which rely heavily on age bands gender and geography sounds crazy right these demographics are the paradigm under which basically all marketing has been rooted for the past  years with gaming personas an yearold male in hollywood ca can have the same persona as a yearold female executive in atlanta ga behaviors can span typical sociodemographic bands when the goal is engagement and conversion behavior is the objective so why shouldn’t the targeting approach take root in the drivers behind that motivation which creates interaction this behavior approach is especially valuable given the limited availability of realtime demographic data in the mobile space stay tuned to the blog or follow dragon army on facebook and twitter to stay updated as we continue our series on applying gaming personas to mobile marketing   marketing in a mobile driven worldas the dust settles from our recent acquisition of proving ground and our physical merging of offices we set our sights on the year ahead one major initiative is telling our story on why we believe the combination of a mobilefirst agency and a game studio is the future of digital experiences engineering loyalty creating deeper engagements driving conversion and measuring the bottom line impact of these digital investments are but a few of the long and evolving list of new challenges marketers are facing every daytoday’s rapid pace of technology evolutions and shifting consumer behaviors makes for an even more uncertain future but we have the solution  mobile it is simultaneously marketing’s biggest opportunity and challenge while mobile is taking a front seat in the consumer’s mind the marketing approach is often still fueled by campaigns rather than the larger brand experience the biggest hurdle to digital success can be boiled down to a single gap  creating valuable and sustainable engagement while marketers have struggled in this brave new world the gamers have flourished  of all money spent on phones is games it’s the number one activity on phones and drives an industry expected to grow to  billion in  born of a necessity to monetize the gaming community has been able to solve the classic marketer challenges  engagement conversion and roi this is the unique space where dragon army has placed our focus the approach is simple  leverage game theory to develop mobile experiences for brands we transfer knowledge from our inhouse game studio to the agency side giving clients an edge when it comes to creating audiencefirst mobile experiences this new methodology is what we are calling applied game theory ™ stay tuned to our blog in the coming weeks as we expand upon this new methodology to marketing in a mobile driven world    the science of successful games part  cooperation and community objectivesby patrick rossetti game designerthe time has come for us to finish our series on successful game mechanics this is the final entry in our five part series that was inspired by a recurring question we get asked when speaking to brandswe’ve found that many marketers need help creating deeper engagement with their mobile experiences part of the reason we recently acquired mobile agency proving ground leveraging game mechanics is one way to solve the issue so we’ve focused this series on some of the most popular design strategies that could be incorporated into digital experiences this is the final entry in our five part series on successful game mechanics cooperation and community objectivesmost people are familiar with soloplay and player vs player games there is another strategy that leverages both of these combined with social interaction to create a hybrid style of cooperative and community objectives this is where players team up with other players to accomplish common objectives either in the form of facing off against other teams of players or team up to complete planned game driven goalsgames like clash of clans pictured build their whole experience around the community by creating objectives and cooperative situations in the game players can form clans in order to do so players must invite  other friends to join them these clans help one another by supplying troops or helping to defend the clan’s bases once a clan is formed leaders and coleaders can start wars when a clan war is declared clans are given one day of preparation before the battle beginsthis group attackdefend mentality helps strengthen the community within the game and keeps players both engaged and invested in the experience bringing them back time and time againwhile there is no single magic bullet design mechanic to guarantee virality and heavy interaction with a game or mobile experience these elements we’ve covered in this series can be found in some of the most popular mobile games we hope you’ve enjoyed the series and thank you for taking this journey with us missed a post catch up on the other mechanics in this series with part  social competition part  limited time and seasonal events part  creativity and self expression and part  partial reinforcement    dragon army acquires mobile agency proving groundin the novel ender’s game colonel graff said it best when he told ender “we’re doing something unusual with dragon army” as you can see in the title dragon army is proud to announce we’ve acquired proving ground one of the leading mobile agencies in the southeast at first the news of a gaming studio joining forces with a mobile development agency might seem…well unusual over the past year we’ve met with a wide range of companies and have found that a singular underlying problem exists businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to create deeper audience engagement with their digital experiencesjeff hilimire dragon army ceo recently had this to say on his personal blog about the combined forces “the new dragon army is one part mobile gaming studio one part mobile experience agency one team makes games for consumers while the other is building mobile experiences for businesses our unique differentiation is that we will apply successful game theory and game psychology to make the mobile experiences we build for companies more engaging and achieve better results”proving ground ceo danny davis will lead as president of the mobile experience agency division of the new company “we are also thrilled about the synergy between our teams” davis said “dragon army’s culture of creative problem solving passion for gamechanging experiences and attention to building great relationships in the community mirrors our own”this isn’t the first time davis and hilimire have worked together in  they launched digital agency spunlogic which eventually sold to engauge then publicis combined under the moxie name while the merger of a gaming studio and mobile agency on the surface might seem a bit unusual at its core our two companies will be better poised to meet the ever changing world of mobile experienceslearn more about the proving ground acquisition and the future of dragon
