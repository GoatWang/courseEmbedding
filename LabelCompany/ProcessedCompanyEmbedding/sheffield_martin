industries inc based in florence situated in the northwest corner of alabama manufactures appliances and utility equipment in two industry segments home heating and leisure and other products martins home heating products which account for about twothirds of the companys sales are produced and sold under the atlanta stove hunter martin fireplaces martin gas products prime heat and warm morning brand names included are a variety of vented and ventfree gas furnaces and heaters as well as a wide range of gas logs gas stoves prefabricated gas and wood fireplaces and gas inserts martin which manufactures its lines at two plants one located in florence and the other in ontario canada markets its products through a variety of distribution channels in both the united states and canada the companys leisure and other products are produced and sold under broilmaster and nuway brand names and include gas barbecue grills and utility trailer kits they are sold in all fifty states as well as in canada mexico south america and europe an esop company since  about a third of martin is owned by its employees  martin brothers establish three companies it was in  just after the turn of the th century that two brothers wh martin sr and charles martin founded king stove and range company a small cast iron foundry in sheffield alabama the foundry made coal and wood heaters cooking stoves and ranges the martins expanded their business in  when they purchased a financially sinking stove foundry in florence just across the river from sheffield the brothers incorporated the acquired business as martin stove and range company a separate business from king stove and range there they made coal and wood stoves as well as gray iron castings the foundry also turned out cast hollowware iron skillets and clothespressing irons known as sad irons the martins again expanded their holdings in  when they traveled to nearby huntsville alabama to bid on some machinery being auctioned off at a bankrupt manufacturing plant they opted to bid on the whole operation not just the equipment and their bid won the martins turned the operation into their third business martin stamping and stove company which began turning out a small line of unvented gas heaters  martinowned companies diversify during world war ii both of the martins foundries manufactured magazine heaters for the army and martin stamping made bomb crates and other strategic materials with the end of the war however the companies returned to manufacturing their lines of gas wood and coal heating equipment they would add electrical heating equipment in the late 0s when martin stamping and stove began making a line of electrical heaters at its facility in huntsville within just few years demand for its electrical heaters led martin stamping and stove to open a new plant located in athens alabama it went into operation in  as the companys electric heater division also located in athens the martin fireplace division began rapid growth thanks in part to the introduction of martin firecones in  and zeroclearance fireplaces in 0 on january   the three companies making up the martin holdings merged to form martin industries inc under the reorganization plan operational control was combined and in june  the companys executive team set up new central administration offices in florence in that same year also in florence martin industries established a centralized engineering facility  martin expands its facilities and acquires other companies while the reorganization and structural changes were in progress the sheffield plant discontinued its foundry operations and was converted into a stamping and fabricating plant in addition the florence plant was retooled into a highly automated foundry to meet martin industries casting demands as well as those of other client companies in the late 0s the companys need for additional manufacturing space prompted martin to buy additional facilities towards the end of  it bought a plant located in americus georgia where in  it began producing its ashley line of heaters it also added a  square foot building in huntsville with the addition of that facility formerly owned by genesco martins total manufacturing and warehouse floor space reached  million square feet the companys expansion through acquisition continued in the early 0s first in 0 it purchased the edison line of dehumidifiers from mcgraw edison next in  it acquired the sahara line from hobart manufacturing which produced its dehumidifiers for general electric other changes came later in the decade notably in  when martin sold its florence foundry to several former employees who entered a longterm agreement with martin to provide it with its needed cast iron that same year martin purchased the wood and gas divisions of atlanta stove which had been one of martins chief competitors for several years martin then transferred the manufacture of atlanta stoves products to its factories in huntsville and athens and moved its sales administration to offices in florence in a calculated strategy to decrease the impact of seasonal sales and thereby achieve a greater and more efficient use of its manufacturing capacity in  martin acquired the nuway line of utility trailer kits and in  the broilmaster line of gas barbecue grills in part these product lines were purchased because their sales climbed during the warmer months of the year which contrasted with the companys home heating products which sold best in the colder seasons martin also diversified into a nonseason market even before acquiring broilmaster in  it purchased filex inc an ossining new york company that manufactured and marketed steel office furniture that it sold through major retail outlets in the third quarter of that year martin incorporated production of the filex desks and filing cabinets into its sheffield and huntsville plants in  martin also expanded its gas heater lines when in the same acquisition that brought broilmaster into its corporate fold it added the warm morning line of vented heaters to its offerings the purchase included a facility in washington park illinois where both broilmaster barbecues and warm morning heaters were made  martin establishes esop and goes public at the beginning of  martin instituted an employee stock ownership plan esop and in the following year the esop purchased a large block of the companys stock which then became available to eligible employees over an extended time in the next year the company sold off its manufacturing plant in americus georgia and its line of dehumidifiers martin industries finally went public in  making an initial public offering ipo of  million shares of common stock it entered the public sector in order to obtain funds for further acquisitions make capital improvements and develop new products among other things the funds helped finance the companys expansion in canada early in  it completed its acquisition of hunter energy and technologies inc and its sister company ontario inc by purchasing all the outstanding shares of the two corporations to buy them martin formed a whollyowned canadian subsidiary ontario inc the total purchase price paid by martin was about  million consisting of cash promissory notes and funds paid into escrow in january  hunter energy and ontario merged to form hunter technology inc hunter continued to operate in its  square foot plant located on a  acre site in orillia ontario manufacturing a line of gas space heaters and prefabricated fireplaces  company faces tough years at close of century in february  martin discontinued its manufacture of office furniture bowing to increased competition and only marginal market success in june of the next year it also moved its production of gas grills gas logs and freestanding ventfree heaters from its facility in washington park illinois to its athens and huntsville alabama facilities in the fall of  robert l goucher replaced william h martin iii as the companys ceo and president a move in part made because of martin industries need for some fresh strategic planning goucher came over from his positions as president and ceo of starmark inc a subsidiary of masco corporation based in sioux falls idaho starmark was a manufacturer of highend kitchen cabinets while at the helm of starmark and in previous executive positions he held with ryobi north america gouchers responsibilities included strategic planning as well as operations sales business development and quality control the late s proved to be very troubling years for martin industries the companys financial setbacks compelled it to consider stringent counter measures including the sale of some of its divisions martins net losses for  reached  million then ballooned to  million the next year goucher quoted in an article in timesdaily indicated that the year  was very difficult for the company its employees and stockholders and further indicated that in  the company was seeking means to restore its financial health one option was to sell off some or all of its product lines in fact it had started to do just that in  when it sold its ashley solid fuel heating division selling the whole enterprise to a strategic partner was also under consideration a partner who goucher said will strengthen our position in the market or possibly bring us new markets or utilize some of our operational capability in  martin industries still employed between 0 and  people in northwest region of alabama known as the shoals about  at its athens plant and another 0 at its canadian operation in ontario in that year as part of its turnaround effort it expanded its sheffield operation to allow the plant to assemble gas fireplace log sets and utility trailers the company also opened a new warehouse shipping and distribution center at the sheffield site and also upgraded the plants equipment and began developing new product lines however at the same time it consolidated some operations and closed its plant in huntsville and late in  sold its washington park illinois manufacturing plant and some of its equipment the year also saw a change at the top when john l duncan replaced goucher as president and ceo duncan who had been a director of the company since  was formerly the president and ceo of murray ohio manufacturing co goucher although no longer involved in the companys daytoday operations was still involved in planning strategic alternatives with the companys investors at the end of  duncan had to face expected but nevertheless very disappointing financial realities the company reported another net loss this time climbing to  million or  per share sales simply plummeted falling to  million down  percent from the companys  sales of  million the companys drop in sales in part resulted from its inability to manufacture and ship its hearth products on time because of problems encountered when martin put in place a new distribution system at the start of  however with the exception of broilmaster premium barbecue grills sales for the companys products fell across the board in  martin under duncans tutelage took several steps to counteract its sagging sales including some belt tightening measures among other things it moved its nuway trailer division to its plant in canada and discontinued assembling both utility trailers and log sets at its facility in sheffield the company was also planning some new strategic initiatives including the option of divesting its broilmaster premium gas grill line in order to focus more sharply on its hearth and heating divisions it was hoped that such measures would soon return the company to profitability in martins favor is the fact that it manufactures goods for a solid market with fairly predictable demands however each of the industry segments in which the company operates is cyclical and its sales are affected by general economic cycles consumer confidence inflation and other factors outside its control such as the demand for new housing and the availability of financing furthermore home heating product sales are seasonal in nature and are directly affected by weather conditions so the company will always face risks beyond those inevitably imposed by industrial competitors part of martins difficulties in  and  arose from the fact that sales of its heating equipment declined because those years had very mild winters some of the warmest ever recorded by the national oceanic and atmosphere administration still martin is not in a terribly volatile industry and does not face any looming threats from either new technologies or competitive industries its chances of getting back on a solid profitability track remained strong at

and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any
