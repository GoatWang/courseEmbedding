morgan stanley investment bankers team playbook helped the firm surge to no  in bank equity deals for the year by heidi moore even before the obama administration subjected  major banks to stress tests this spring jonathan pruzan and his colleagues in morgan stanleys financial institutions group were working on how to help lenders replenish their equity coffers last summer morgan stanley created a team of about  people including bankers as well as professionals from fixed income structured finance and equity capital markets that began meeting three times a week to brainstorm it was led by pruzan the cohead of north american fig and two key senior colleagues john esposito and taylor wright in may when the results of the stress tests were announced and the banks were ordered to raise capital morgan stanley sprang into action the playbook developed by pruzan and his group included overnight deals which are pulled together quickly to take advantage of sudden market opportunities marketed deals which are sold over a period of days and dribbleouts  quiet steady block trades in which a bank can sell as much as  percent of its monthly stock volume we were advising all our clients to be ready at a moments notice says pruzan  the results have not been too shabby as of june  morgan stanley had surged to no  in bank equity deals for the year up from no  at the same time in  according to dealogic the firm has advised  us banks on raising  billion in equity capital just behind goldman sachs group which has advised  banks on  billion in such deals pruzan led the morgan stanley team that generated  billion for us bancorp  billion for bbt corp  billion for suntrust banks and  million for fifth third bancorp the firm moved fast in every case about one fifth of fifth thirds dribbleout had been completed when a sudden burst of investor demand set morgan stanley running to sell the remaining  million through block trades on june  the head of morgan stanleys equity syndicate mohit assomull gave the sale order over the squawk box at  in the afternoon by  pruzan had called fifth third to let it know there was buying interest for more than  billion pruzan grew up in new york city but well outside the world of wall street his father and grandparents worked in the garment industry pruzan followed the lead of his two brothers who worked at mckinsey  co and goldman sachs respectively in the swaggering dealmaking era of the late s pruzan joined painewebber  cos financial institutions group in  the year he graduated from tufts university with a degree in political science and economics his first job was as an analyst working for james kilman a banker whom pruzan helped hire at morgan stanley last year to head its specialty finance advisory group pruzan moved to morgan stanley from painewebber in  he advised on a flurry of bank deals from the seminal merger of chase manhattan corp and chemical banking corp to deutsche banks purchase of bankers trust co to bank of america corps acquisitions of fleetboston financial and lasalle bank corp in  he was promoted by derek kirkland then head of fig and now a senior adviser at morgan stanley to oversee its us group pruzan took up his new post last year just in time for the biggest bank crisis in more than  years one of the lessons is that market perception becomes reality he notes you might not agree with it but its best to accept it and move on gmac financial services chief finance officer rob hull has appreciated that nononsense view as pruzan has helped the finance company wrest its independence away from general motors corp jon has been able to distill strategic options when theyve not been easily discernible hull says sponsored video get started subscribe show me all
