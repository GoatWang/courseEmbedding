heightpxiframecopycloseif you were asked what the top three ecommerce sites are in the world what would you guess amazon check apple yup but there’s a good chance your third guess is wrong at least according to domino’s ceo j patrick doylewe believe by transaction counts we’re in the top five of ecommerce companies in the world we know we’re behind apple and amazon but we may be as high as third large screens in dominos tech offices show uptotheminute sales numbers at the companys  restaurants across the world the company also tracks on which platform customers are ordering  tommy andresmarketplacedomino’s is the secondlargest pizza company in the world behind pizza hut the company sells a million pies a day at more than  restaurants around the world and one in eight pizzas purchased in the us is from a domino’s franchise but the reason doyle considers it an ecommerce site is because half of domino’s sales are now digitalnearly half of dominos corporate headquarters work in technology a full wing of the office is lined with cubicles white boards video monitors and signs like this one  tommy andresmarketplacethe company hit it big on innovation albeit a more analog version founder tom monaghan invented a firm cardboard box that kept pizza hot and prevented squishing in the companys early days and years later an employee came up with a combination ladle and spoon called the spoodle that dominos now uses worldwide the spoodle allows pizza cooks to spoon sauce and spread it evenly with the same tool every second counts when you have a  minutesorless guarantee the company honors the invention with a display case in the lobby at dominos hq  tommy andresmarketplacethe speed and convenience dominos became known for made the company digitalready in a lot of ways now customers can order pizzas from a smart phone a smart watch a smart tv even a smart car and all it takes is one tweet one text one voice command or even one emoji it calls the platform “anyware”so is domino’s a pizza company or a tech company well that’s complicated…we employ about  people here in ann arbor at domino’s headquarters and about  of them are in technologyanyware is the latest phase in domino’s fiveyearinthemaking reinvention plan one that started the company back at the drawing board in our pizza sucksthe first step in fixing a problem is admitting it existsi still remember getting everybody into this room and saying folks we gotta make a change” we’ve got to do something different let’s start from scratchroxanne swamba was one of dominos corporate chefs responsible creating the companys new pizza recipe in  it was in this test kitchen at the ann arbor headquarters where thenpresident j patrick doyle told his employees we have a problem  tommy andresmarketplacethe room doyle is referring to is the domino’s test kitchen it was there in  that domino’s chefs experimented with new ingredients and recipes after months of testing the company rolled out a new and improved formula but instead of simply stamping “new and improved” on the box doyle and crew did something rather unorthodox they told the world their pizza wasn’t very good the official title of the ad campaign was “domino’s pizza turnaround” but the media quickly dubbed it the “our pizza sucks” campaign in the first commercial focus group participants called the sauce bland and the crust cardboardlike the face of the ad campaign was dominos thenpresident j patrick doyle who apologized to customers and told them he wanted to do betterto keep turning dough into dough dominos needed a better crust heres where the recipe for uncardboardlike crust was born back in   tommy andresmarketplacethis is a company that had built the whole brand around fast and reliable delivery and marketing  says you focus on your point of differentiation we kept talking about delivery and  minutes or less and it just stopped working we realized that everyone in the world who wanted fast convenient pizza was already buying from us and the people who wanted a great pie simply were notpizzas created in the test kitchen of dominos corporate headquarters in ann arbor michigan doyle says employees are constantly working to craft new creations  tommy andresmarketplaceit may seem crazy to tell customers your namesake product isn’t up to snuff especially in the midst of a recession but the unexpected honesty workedour sales that first quarter we relaunched were up  percent we were up  percent for the year and i will tell you if i had known we were  and not  on december  i would’ve bought some pizzas myself keeping up with the papa johnsesreinvention for domino’s wasn’t just a onestep process since unveiling its new pizza recipe the company has released new sandwiches pastas chicken dishes and breads in  it publicly dropped “pizza” from its name and rebranded all of its storesdoyle says the company is constantly whipping up new products and improving triedandtrue ones in its test kitchen and relies on consumers for final approval there are  booths each outfitted with a slot for sliding slices to customers and gauging their grins and gags domino’s calls it the “sensory panel”the sensory booth is used to test out new ingredients pizza combinations and more on consumers at dominos hq  tommy andresmarketplacewe do it not only for new products but we also do it if we’re looking for a new cheese supplier or a new pepperoni supplier that sort of thing it has to be an identical match to what we’ve designated the perfect pepperonione of the challenges to creating new menu items at dominos is that everything has to be cooked on the same eightminute conveyor belt oven doyle says a lot of the new menu items start at the stores where customers make requests and franchisee owners fiddle they then come to corporate for testing largely everything we make goes through the same oven for the same time at the same temperature its a big operating requirement you look at a lot of different restaurants — mcdonalds for instance has eight or  different cooking platforms in each store we have one we have an oven so everything we make weve got to be able to make well through that oven it makes it a little harder on the front end to get the products right but thats also what makes our stores so efficient is we do have fundamentally just one cooking platform in the store dominos employees sit on this side of the sensory booth and gauge consumers thoughts on new products  tommy andresmarketplaceto keep pace with the surge in fastcasual restaurants domino’s is also trying to improve its atmosphere though it still has no plans to put seating in any of its franchises doyle says he wants the small portion of customers who come into a store to be able to watch their pizza being made he calls it the “pizza theater” conceptcheese aint the only thing with culturedomino’s hq has a glassencased mockup of a domino’s franchise right in the heart of the building doyle says everyone in the company has to learn how to make a pizza even if they’re destined for a cubicleevery other week we’ve got a training class here where we’re training everybody who is above store level on the basics of domino’s pizza we set this up and run it as a store if you’re an accountant if you’re in marketing if you’re in technology you’re going to learn the basics and you’re going to learn about how what you do day to day affects the storesin the heart of dominos hq is a fully functioning store all employees regardless of their position start here making a pizza and running mock daily operations to get a feel for the business  tommy andresmarketplacedomino’s has built a passionate workforce at its mothership and also throughout its worldwide franchises doyle boasts that  percent of franchisee owners started as employees at domino’s stores perhaps that’s why diehard employees are sometimes referred to as “dominoids” there’s even a companywide cheerhow do you say pepperoni in swahilidomino’s has opened more than  restaurants in  countries since it reinvented its pizza in  there are now more than  stores in the us and  overseas last year the company made  billion of its  billion in sales outside of the us and doyle says they’re just scratching the surface  ninetyfive percent of the world’s population lives outside of the us there is lots of room to growa hallway at dominos world resource center is lined with the flags of the  countries in which dominos pizza can be ordered  tommy andresmarketplacedoyle says domino’s has seen success in the uk russia brazil and nigeria but india has been the company’s runaway hit “we are quickly approaching  stores in india” doyle said “that is now by store count our biggest market outside of the us”but setting up shop overseas comes with challenges the asian diet for example doesnt historically include cheese and much of the world is lactose intolerant figuring out what’s going to sell in each market requires local inputwe control quality here but in terms of taste the new pizza topping that’s going to come out in mumbai people in ann arbor are going to be fascinated by what they’re doing there but weve got a separate group that works with our master franchisee in india they have all of their stores in india theyve got their own marketing team there and they come up with the new product launches there we make sure the quality is right but they’re the ones coming up with the ideas because theyve got their fingers on the pulse of the consumer in mumbaigrowth in china has been slow for domino’s so far maybe part of the reason is the peanut mayonnaise heart crust pizza it offers therecourtesy dominosno such thing as too much pizzaso domino’s has  restaurants worldwide and sells  million pies a day surely growth is slowing right this might be the only time domino’s openly says “not so fast…”we think we can get another  stores in the us and as big as we are we’re only selling one in eight pizzas in the usonlymarketplace host kai ryssdal with doyle near the entrance of the tech wing at the dominos world resource center  tommy andresmarketplacefollow kai
