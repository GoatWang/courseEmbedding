catch certification scheme is meant to accommodate complex fisheries where the interactions along the value chain create challenges in creating catch certificate  standard applications groupings will create efficiencies in completing applications where the source of the product does not have to be reentered at every application a user can simply select the relevant groupings for the consignment groupings must be created within the fcs groupings can be vesselbased group of vessels you own or purchase from or communitybased group of communities or buyer  agent you purchase from after creating one or more groupings you can then use them for all future catch certificates to create a grouping click on ‘create application in the navigation menu then select application type catch certificate  request grouping then click ‘continue the grouping section is broken down into tabs the first of which is the group detail tab group detail tab the group detail tab appears as follows application description  this field is intended to provide a description for the users record management it is a free text field that allows a user to create an identifier for the grouping for easy reference and record tracking associated species  click the ‘lookup button to select the species that will be associated with the grouping note a grouping may only be associated with one species group name  the name for the group being created this is for ccp records only the group name will not appear on the catch certificate naming standards must include species area and gear type if known example lobster  lfa   traps group alias  the alias is essentially a short version of the group name that will be displayed on the catch certificate naming standards must consist of  characters including all uppercase letters and containing two consecutive numbers ex lobster vessel group type  choose this grouping if the vessels that made the catch are known vessel details are mandatory with this group type group subtypes buyer  agent  if the catch was purchased from a buyer  agent check the buyer  agent box and fill in their information within the buyer  agent tab aboriginal  if the catch was made using aboriginal vessels check the aboriginal box community group type  choose this grouping if vessels involved in the catch are not known at the time of application this group type will identify in which communities the catch took place community details are mandatory with this group type group subtypes buyer  agent  if the catch was purchased from a buyer  agent check the buyer  agent box and fill in their information within the buyer  agent tab aboriginal  if the catch was made in aboriginal communities or by aboriginal harvesters check the aboriginal box note only choose a community grouping if the vessels are unknown since vessel groupings are more traceable they are the preferred method of groupings collector vessel group type  choose this grouping if there was a collector vessel involved in the catch please contact the ccp oc for more information on collector vessel groupings once you select the appropriate group type you can then move on to creating the group by completing all the mandatory fields throughout each of the tabs in the application once all tabs are completed the grouping request can be submitted note the application for a catch certificate  request grouping has a service standard of  business days for processing you will receive an email upon approval and you will be able to use the group within the fcs to create catch certificates  groupbased when creating a catch certificate  group based you can now select the groups that you created which are applicable to the relevant catch since vessel and vessel  buyer  agent groupings are the most common the steps taken to create a vessel grouping and a buyer  agent grouping are listed below for your reference please contact the ccps operations centre for more information on communitybased groupings vessel grouping the groupings should be set up to represent all of the vessels that participated in catch for the products that are being exported a grouping can contain  to  vessels  vessels is the maximum number of vessels permitted in a grouping for traceability purposes however exceptions can be made based on the nature of your operations please contact the operations centre for more details groupings do not allow vessels that are over  feet in length overall those vessels need to have their own catch certificate  standard some exceptions are permitted mainly if the vessel operates within an inshore or midshore fleet offshore vessels that are over  feet in length overall cannot be exempted please contact the operations centre for vessel exceptions if your operations are based on vessels that you own and vessels from which you buy products it is recommended that you create multiple groupings one for the vessels you own and another for the vessels you source from there is no maximum amount of groupings that a company can create it is recommended that you group vessels by common characteristics common characteristics include species fishing area home port for example if you have  vessels  of these vessels catch lobster in one fishing area and the other  vessels catch silver hake you would need to create  groupings one for each species if the  lobster vessels didnt fish in the same area  fish in lfa  and  fish in lfa  we would suggest creating two lobster groupings one for each fishing area grouping by common characteristics and keeping groups smaller is beneficial for two reasons the first is that when you are creating a certificate it will be much easier for you to select the appropriate groupings vessels for the shipment that you are exporting the second reason is that it increases traceability and provides a more accurate representation of the actual catch that is listed on the catch certificate vessel grouping steps select ‘create application and then select the application type catch certificate  request grouping group detail tab you will see a screen displaying the group detail for this catch certificate  request grouping complete the

tsn code in the species fields and the weight fields will appear estimated live weight kg  the approximate weight of the whole catch prior to any primary processing ie before gutting estimated landing weight kg  the estimated unofficial weight of a catch as determined by the fish harvester note if there is processing onboard this weight may change from the estimated live weight verified landing weight kg  the official weight recorded by mechanisms at the time the catch is landed such as a dockside monitoring program note for any live whole product that is not processed ex lobster and is being shipped these  weights may be the same applicable conversion  a conversion factor used to convert weights after processing note this is not a mandatory field and will not apply to every product this applicable conversion is used mainly when processing occurs if you know the product weight that you are shipping but do not have any estimated weight you can use a conversion factor to estimate this weight example if you are shipping clam tongues no shell included in shipping and you know that the clam tongues compose  of the total weight including shell then you can use this number to estimate the total catch weight one method to figure out the estimated live and landing weights is as follows if the product weight was kg then you would have kg     kg  add species  click this button

button number  in the above diagram to add the other areas catch start date  this is where you enter the date of the start of the catch catch end date  this is where you enter the end date of the catch note if the catch was made during a period exceeding  weeks you must split the catch date ranges into  week periods it is suggested that you split that catch dates by month the reason that we suggest structuring the dates in this manner is because the eu may question shipments with very large catch date ranges since it shows lack of traceability to add multiple catch areas or dates you must click the ‘add catch area button and then put in the other date ranges example you know that your shipment of lobster was caught by multiple fishing trips from september  to december  in nafo area x however since you are not permitted to put this entire date range into the system it is recommended that you add separate catch date ranges for each month a screenshot of this example is shown

for a certificate to load once the ‘print button has been clicked clicking on other functions within the system while this document is downloading will cause the download to stop note a common problem when users are trying to obtain a catch certificate is that some users have either a popup blocker enabled or a download blocker enabled users will need to disable their popup blocker to allow the internet browser access to download the file if you still cannot obtain a certificate even after the popup blocker has been disabled contact our office and we will be able to send you a certificate below is a common example of a popup blocker the popup blocker will display a bar across the top of your browser to download the file click on this bar and select ‘download file you may need to click the ‘print button again to download the catch certificate file once you have disabled your popup blocker the next step after obtaining your catch certificate is to give this certificate to your importer you can print this certificate and send it with your consignment or send it electronically to your importer or fax it to your importer reissue certificate  choose the ‘reissue button if you would like to alter a previously approved certificate that may have incorrect information the only information fields that are able to be edited on a reissue are weight fields  you are able to lower weights if you incorrectly put in higher weight than what is actually being shipped or if the weight requirement for a shipment is lowered after you have already had a certificate approve weights can only be lowered you are never able to increase the amount of weight listed on a certificate after it has been approved tabs that are not certified by the validating authority these tabs include transshipment reexport and files since all other information has been validated it can no longer be changed on the catch certificate once the necessary changes are complete within the certificate you will need to select ‘submit application once submitted the new certificate application will be automatically approved and available within your certificate list the screen capture above shows the original certificate and the new certificate within the certificate list the original certificate now has a status of consolidatedreissued and can no longer be edited the newly created certificate will have a status of approved forward certificate  your company has the ability to forward a certificate to another company within the fcs if necessary the most common use of forwarding will occur when the company that has originally created the catch certificate has sold their product to another company before exportation to the eu it is now the second company that requires a catch certificate not the company that initially created the certificate to forward a certificate to another company click on the appropriate catch certificate from the certificate list then press ‘forward a new screen will become available that will allow you to choose the company from a list of companies registered within the fcs that you wish to forward the certificate to a screen capture of this screen is below once you have selected the desired company press the ‘forward certificate button once you forward the certificate you will be brought back to the certificate list forwarded certificates can no longer

only functions that are still available for the certificate that has been forwarded once you forward a certificate the receiving company will now have the certificate show up within their certificates list it is likely that the receiving company will consolidate this certificate with a certificate of their own recall  select this option if you wish to recall a certificate that has been previously forwarded recalling a certificate will give you full access to the certificates functions such as print reissue and the option to forward again if necessary recalling basically brings back a forwarded certificate so that you can use it like any other approved certificate consolidating catch certificates it should be noted that consolidating certificates is not a common occurrence and will usually only take place when many certificates are used for one shipment or in the case where a company has received a forwarded certificate from another company within the fcs that need to be combined into one certificate for a shipment individual approved catch certificates can be consolidated into a single catch certificate by clicking on this option a consolidated catch certificate does not have to
