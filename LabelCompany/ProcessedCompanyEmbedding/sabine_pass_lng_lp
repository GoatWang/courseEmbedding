regulatory commission the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has the exclusive authority to approve or deny an application for the siting construction expansion or operation of an lng terminal per the natural gas act  the ferc is the lead federal agency that will determine whether cheniere will be issued an order granting authority under section  of the natural gas act for the construction an lng project  the ferc will also monitor all construction and restoration activities to insure that cheniere complies with all federal state and local permits plans and regulations  the sabine pass liquefaction project received a ferc order granting authorization to commence construction on the first four lng trains on april   under docket no cp  the discussion below describes the process undertaken    the approval process the initial step in the process was to request from ferc to engage in the prefiling environmental review process  the prefiling process provides opportunities for federal and state cooperating agencies ldeq usace usfws etc and other public stakeholders to comment on the project impacts prior to an application to the ferc being submitted  when permission was granted to begin the prefiling process cheniere will then prepare the draft resource reports the next step was for the company to submit the draft resource reports for submittal to the ferc staff to aid their preparation of an environmental assessment ea or an environmental impact statement eis to fulfill the requirements of the national environmental policy act nepa the purpose of the eaeis is to inform the public and the permitting agencies about the potential adverse andor beneficial environmental and safety impacts of proposed projects and their alternatives the resource reports are divided into the following subjects general project description  water use and quality  fish wildlife and vegetation  cultural resources  socioeconomics  geological resources  soils  land use recreation and aesthetics  air and noise quality  alternatives    reliability and safety  pcb contamination not required for this project  engineering and design material  the stakeholders were given the opportunity to comment on the resource reports through public meetings and postings  any issues identified were addressed prior to final environmental documents and approvals being issued  the schematic illustrates the steps involved and the points where the public was given the opportunity to comment on the prefiling process upon ferc approval of the project cheniere received a commission order stating its decision on whether to approve construction and operation of the lng terminal   market rate authority and  conditions that must be met prior to construction  additional environmental permits and clearances that were applied for  section  water quality certificate from the louisiana department of environmental quality  section  permit from the us army corps of engineers for work in wetlands  coastal zone management clearance from the louisiana department of natural resources  federal endangered species clearance from the us fish and wildlife service  state endangered species clearance from the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries  air emissions permit title v  psd from the louisiana department of environmental quality  section  national historic preservation act clearance from the louisiana department of culture recreation and tourism – received   authorization to export from the department of energy              design and construction monitoring ferc authorized the commencement of construction once the project met all preconstruction conditions required by the ferc order and then authorized the commencement of construction  prior to commencement of service from the lng facility cheniere received written approval from ferc only after complying with all preoperation conditions listed in the commission order does a company receive authorization

of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc or commission will prepare an environmental impact statement eis that will discuss the environmental impacts of the sabine pass lng and pipeline project involving construction and operation of facilities proposed by sabine pass lng lp and cheniere sabine pass pipeline company collectively referred to as cheniere sabine in cameron parish louisiana these facilities would consist of a liquefied natural gas lng import terminal and storage facilities and approximately  miles of inchdiameter pipeline in cameron parish this eis will be used by the commission in its decisionmaking process to determine whether the project is in the public convenience and necessity this notice is being sent to residents within  mile of the proposed lng terminal facilities potentially affected landowners along the proposed pipeline route federal state and local government agencies elected officials environmental and public interest groups native american tribes and local libraries and newspapers we  have asked state and local government representatives to notify their constituents of this planned action and encourage them to comment on their areas of concern if you are a landowner receiving this notice you may be contacted by a pipeline company representative about the acquisition of an easement to construct operate and maintain the proposed pipeline facilities the pipeline company would seek to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement however if the project is approved by the commission that approval conveys with it the right of eminent domain therefore if easement negotiations fail to produce an agreement the pipeline company could initiate condemnation proceedings in accordance with state law a fact sheet prepared by the ferc entitled “an interstate natural gas facility on my land what do i need to know” was attached to the project notice cheniere sabine provided to landowners this fact sheet addresses a number of typically asked questions including the use of eminent domain and how to participate in the commissions proceedings it is available for viewing on the ferc internet web site at wwwfercgov summary of the proposed project cheniere sabine proposes to build a new lng import storage and vaporization terminal in a rural part of cameron parish louisiana across the sabine pass channel from sabine pass texas the lng import terminal would import store and vaporize an average of approximately  million standard cubic feet per day mmscfd of lng with an installed capacity of  mmscfd for supply to us natural gas markets cheniere sabine seeks authority to construct and operate the following new facilities a new marine basin connected to the sabine pass channel that would include a ship maneuvering area and two protected berths to unload up to  lng ships per year with a ship capacity ranging up to  cubic meters m of lng two inchdiameter stainless steel insulated lng transfer lines to transfer the lng from the berth facilities to the lng storage tanks three allmetal doublewalled single containment topentry lng storage tanks each with a nominal working volume of approximately  m and each with secondary containment dikes to contain  percent of the gross tank volume sixteen highpressure submerged combustion lng vaporizors with a capacity of approximately  mmscfd each as well as other associated vaporization equipment including pumps boiloff gas compressors instrumentation and safety systems ancillary utilities buildings and service facilities including hazard detection and fire response systems approximately  miles of inchdiameter natural gas pipeline extending from the lng import terminal to an interconnection with four existing pipelines at johnsons bayou three metering stations one at the lng terminal site one at an interconnection with natural gas pipeline company of america and one at the interconnection with the existing pipelines at johnsons bayou and associated pipeline facilities including a pig launcher receiver facility and three mainline valves and one side valve construction of the lng terminal facilities would take approximately  years and the pipeline would take approximately  to  months cheniere sabine proposes to place the project in service before the  winter heating season the general location of the proposed project facilities is shown in appendix  in addition certain nonjurisdictional electric and water line facilities would be required for operation of the lng terminal and would be subject to review and approval by the appropriate state and federal agencies the jefferson davis electric cooperative would construct a mile  kilovolt kv electric transmission line that would extend from its existing substation near the intracoastal waterway south across the eastern edge of sabine lake to the lng terminal site cameron parish waterworks district  would construct an approximate mile inchdiameter potable water line that will extend from its facilities near johnsons bayou west along the northern edge of state highway  to the lng terminal site land requirements for construction cheniere sabine has acquired  acres of land formerly used for dredge spoil placement by the us army corps of engineers for the proposed lng terminal facility of this total about  acres would be affected during construction comprising  acres of land and  acres of water operation start printed page of the lng facility would affect about  acres comprising  acres of land and  acres of water cheniere sabine proposes to use a footwide construction rightofway and a footwide operational rightofway for the pipeline construction of the pipeline would disturb about  acres of land and would include land required for the pipeline construction rightofway additional temporary workspaces access roads meter stations and other associated aboveground facilities total operational land requirements would be approximately  acres for the new permanent rightofway access roads and above ground facilities the eis process the national environmental policy act nepa requires the commission to take into account the environmental impacts that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity or an import authorization under section  of the natural gas act nepa also requires us to discover and address issues and concerns the public may have about proposals this process is referred to as “scoping” the main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the eis on the important environmental issues and reasonable alternatives with this notice we are soliciting input from the public and interested agencies to help us focus the analysis in the eis on the potentially significant environmental issues related to the proposed action we are also asking federal state local and tribal agencies with jurisdiction andor special expertise with respect to the environmental issues to formally cooperate with us in the preparation of the eis these agencies especially the us fish and wildlife service us army corps of engineers national marine fisheries service and the us coast guard may choose to participate once they have evaluated the proposal relative to their responsibilities agencies that would like to request cooperating status should follow the instructions for filing comments described later in this notice our independent analysis of the proposed project will be included in a draft eis the draft eis will be published and mailed to federal state and local agencies public interest groups interested individuals affected landowners native american tribes newspapers libraries and the commissions official service list for this proceeding a day comment period will be allotted for review of the draft eis we will consider all timely comments on the draft eis and revise the document as necessary before issuing the final eis in addition we will consider all comments on the final eis when we make our recommendations to the commission currently identified environmental issues the eis will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under the resource headings listed below we have already identified several issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review of the proposed facilities and the environmental information provided by cheniere sabine this preliminary list of issues may be changed based on your comments and our analysis geology and soils
