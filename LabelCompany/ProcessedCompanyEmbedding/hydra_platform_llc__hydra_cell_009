galleryvideo gallerydownloadsreviews comments the hydra™ game console is based on a socketed pin dip version of the new parallax multiprocessing propeller chip the propeller chip is simplified cell processor very similar in concept to the sony cell processor used in the playstation  the propeller chip is the main cpu of the hydra and runs at  mhz for an overall processing power of  mips  mips per processor the propeller has k of internal static ram used for program storage and work space while the hydra game console has a k of eeprom storage the hydra supports numerous interface devices such as ntscpal video vga video ps ports networking nintendo compatible gamepads as well as a pin expansion port header used to plug small x cards into also as propeller chips are upgraded the pin dip propeller chip can be removed from the hydra and upgraded since its socketed additionally the main clock crystal on the hydra can be replaced foroverclocking experiments  the hydra graphics and soundthe hydra graphics and sound are generated by the propeller chips internal hardware via a hardwaresoftware combination the hydra is capable of generating very high resolution ntsc and vga displays with up to  color variations the basic palette of the hydra is  colors screen resolutions are  software programmable and thus the hydra can generate almost any kind of tiled bitmapped or sprite based displays with the proper programming numerous games and graphics demos show off the different techniques to generate graphics on the system sound on the hydra is generated via a bit pwm pulse width modulation system currently drivers come with the hydra that can support up to  channels with  khz playback of pure tones as well as digital samples a complete adsr attacksustaindecayrelease software engine is included users of the chips like the ay and sid chips from the c atari and other bit computers will feel right at home  the propeller chipthe propeller chip is a bit symmetrical multiprocessor with independent cores each core can run its own program and has its own data thus the propeller is a mimd multipleinstructionmultipledata system basically its like having  processors on the hydra each core called a cog has a local memory of  bit words that are used for both instructions and data additionally each cog has  counters with numerous modes of operations plls and video serializing hardware thus each cog is actually capable of generating video independently the only coupling between the cogs is thru a common shared k byte memory each cog accesses the shared memory on a round robin schedule the architecture is risc based with usually  clocks per instruction   programming and the propeller ideprogramming the hydra game consoles propeller chip is done via the propeller integrated developed environment ide there are two languages that can be used spin and assembly language spin is very similar to cbasic and for beginners while assembly language programming is for those that want the ultimate in control and speed in either case both languages are integrated seamlessly in the ideand you simply write your code compile and

language to get started with the kit the kit includes everything you need to get started tv and pc not includedthe kit also comes with a comprehensive book on game programming for the propeller in spin and assembly language  game programming for the propeller powered hydra within the book the hydra hardware is covered in grueling detail with schematics descriptions and tips allowing you to take full advantage of its resources including its expansion port and game card written by bestselling game development author andre’ lamothe the included book is your complete guide to developing games graphics and media applications for the propeller powered hydra game console the book assumes you have only basic programming experience in any basic or clike language it covers all aspects of the propeller chip from its architecture to using the propeller tool ide for programming in both spin and assembly language with numerous demo programs to use as starting points for your own gamesincluded on the kit cd is all the source code and executables for all the included games demos tools and examples additionally the hydra game development kit includes hydra basic which is a dialect of tiny basic based on the specification originally published in dr dobb’s journal in  with this classic version of basic you can write programs directly on the hydra without the need for a pc simply load basic into the hydra or on the included game cartridge and you are up and running with nothing more than your tv and keyboardthe hydra is not only a game console but a complete computer system with

hydras do not have a complex nervous system but a very simple nerve net how can a multicellular organism without an organized nervous system respond to environmental stimuli materials compound microscope well slide and cover slip dropper or pipette live hydra toothpick live daphnia optional instructions transfer the hydra from its container to the well of the depression slide using the pipette or dropper observe the hydra under low power paying attention to how the hydra’s body is arranged the walls of their bodies are at most two cell layers thick which enables them to transport nutrients to all of their cells through diffusion how does the hydra react to a new object entering the environment to observe the response place the tip of the toothpick near the hydra’s tentacles what happens if you touch the hydra be careful as it is a live organism if daphnia are available you can observe the hydra’s feeding behavior use the pipette or dropper to pick up a daphnia and place it into the well with the hydra within a few minutes you will see thin stringlike structures shoot from the hydra these structures are nematocysts which pierce the prey and may contain poison
