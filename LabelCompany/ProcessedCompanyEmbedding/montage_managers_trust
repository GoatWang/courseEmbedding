macintosh view lockable glossary index trustmanager trust manager the trust manager has a number of preferences that affect an applications environment security administrators are advised to review these settings and configure client installations so that they are satisfied with the overall security of their workflows this preference category contains the following subfeatures certified document trust disabling privileged locations enhanced security internet access protected view specifying privileged locations internet access because internet access is a potential security risk end users are provided with the means to manage that risk by controlling what sites can be accessed via the internet access panel in the trust manager note that the privileged locations panel in the security enhanced pane also provides the means to trust specific hosts however trust manager settings always take precedence for hosts for example if wwwadobecom is blocked by the trust manager but is marked as a trusted host in privileged locations then that site will be blocked note the behavior is slightly different for files and folders for  and earlier trust manager settings take precedence while with  privileged locations take precedence for example a file or folder which is trusted in privileged locations can contain links that acrobat can follow even if the host in the link is set as blocked or urls are set to block all in trust manager also cross domain access always requires specifically trusting those domains as a privileged locationsimply trusting those sites in the trust

enhanced security checkbox specifying privileged locations privileged locations are designed to let users and administrators specify trusted content that should be exempt from security retrictions security restrictions come from features like the following enhanced security restricts cross domain access data injection and script injection etc user preferences user interface controls for web access javascript xobject external streams multimedia that plays in rd party players and so on application preferences adobes js blacklist high privileged js and other items that are blocked by default privileged locations provide a way to bypass these restrictions a location may be a file folder or host and there can be an end user list in hkcu and an itonly list in hklm it can disable user interface controls and lock restrictions in place so that end usrs cant change them via features like enhanced security and the javascript controls for trusted locations admins then specify directories and hosts that are known to be trustworthy in the relevant cabs eg ccrossdomain cdatainjection thereby effectively creating a white list for secure workflows you can also elevate trusted win os zones to privileged locations since these are already under it control prior to  btrustostrustedsites provided trust for trusted sites with these versions trust is also extended to local intranet zones privileged location support is evolving rapidly so pay attention to the version privileged locations are identified by a unique tid with a string value pointing to the trusted location the container cab determines which restriction the document can bypass for example a tid under ccrossdomain allows cross domain access adding recursive to tids under trustedfolders results in setting recursive trust though this is on by default beginning with  note the following trustmanagerctrustedfolders contains cabs for trusted folders and files trustmanagerctrustedsites contains cabs for trusted http and https hosts each tid must be unique in the example below t could reside in each of the cabs but there could not be more than one t in each cab registry configuration cross domain file trust hkeycurrentusersoftwareadobeacrobat readertrustmanagerctrustedfoldersccrossdomain tcdocumentsandsettingsbrogersmydocumentsacrobatlogopng the feature behaves as follows the trust manager hive does not appear in the registry until the user interface is exercised however you can create it manually a privileged location may be a file folder or host with  and later folder trust is recursive that is all subfolders are trusted when the parent folder is trusted privileged locations can be permanently disabled or enabled by the administrator configuration may occur via the user interface or directly in the registry if configured through the user interface the privileged location id only may or may not appear under under all the possible cabs functionality changes across releases so test the ui and see what trust is assigned administrators can lock down the feature in hklm so that users cannot change the setting to do so create an identical set of preferences in hklm admins can also disable the end users ability to modify the list by setting bdisabletrustedsites and bdisabletrustedfolders permissions granted by other features often overlap for example cross domain policies internet access settings in trust manager and certificate trust settings for certified documents sometimes interact so that the most permissive setting takes precedence test your configuration prior to deployment all key tid names under a particular cab must be unique x products support the use of wildcard matching of subdomain components for trusted host urls for example for a basic url of abcadobecom you can wildcard on all of a b or c it is required that at least the first subdomain is specified adobe in this case so corpadobecom or lcformsadobecom works but formscorpadobecom or

professional work experience have i ever been spoken to in that manner so i did not complete my two week notice closed the highest number of loans the previous month and i was told that when i submitted my notice it disqualified me from getting a monthly bonus i was told that i would get my accrued pto since i put in a two week notice but then was told i would not even though the employee
