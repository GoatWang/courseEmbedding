eight years of related grain trading and feed experience working for three international companies pat o’brien now president of pat o’brien  sons inc decided it was time to put his hard work to use — at his own company o’brien founded pat o’brien  sons in  in hamburg new york in  familyowned pat o’brien  sons began producing what it’s now known best for steamflaked corn a highquality dietary starch product formulated particularly for dairy cows with a processing facility equipped with a dryer and storage for more than  bushels of corn in geneva new york pat o’brien  sons is the largest steamflake producer in new york “we’re one of only a few companies in the northeast that makes this type of product” says o’brien pat o’brien  sons is centrally located in the heart of the new york dairy industry and corn belt “from our location we can effectively serve all of new york parts of pennsylvania vermont new hampshire connecticut and maine” says o’brien the company’s office and logistics staff is located in eden new york and the processing team is based in geneva totaling approximately eight employees pat o’brien  sons purchases all of its grain for processing from local growers once the corn is processed it moves on to serve a range of regional dairy farms and feed mills golden flakes for highenergy feed while a number of other feed companies in the northeast produce hotrolled corn and other types of cornbased feed o’brien says the difference between its steamflaked corn and other versions is enormous “no one else in new york makes the same quality steamflaked corn that we do” he asserts by heat treating the corn similar to how bypass soy and canola meals are processed and then flaking it extremely thin the result is more starch and carbohydrates available to the cow making for a highenergy feed “our process makes the starch that is in the corn more readily available for the animal to digest before the feed is passed” explains o’brien “upward of  percent of the starch in corn is available with the steamflaking process whereas digestible starch levels attained by conventional grinding cracking and rolling methods could be as low as  percent” by properly processing the corn pat o’brien  sons generates a more efficient feed other benefits of pat o’brien  sons signature golden flakes include  increased net energy of lactation  increased dietary starch fermentation in the rumen  increased total starch digestion  increased urea cycling in the gut  increased microbial protein flow to the small intestine  decreased milk urea nitrogen  decreased fecal nitrogen output eyes on efficiency o’brien says it all comes down to efficiency and getting the most “bang for your buck” in feed “with so many input variables — the price of corn moisture and weather equipment and machinery costs and more — producers are depending on a consistent source of starch and steamflaking is the best way to go although they might spend  percent more on the source of starch they’re getting  to  percent more back in efficiency” since pat o’brien  sons started steam flaking in  the company has added mixing capabilities so it can offer “straight” flakes or blends with other ingredients such as chocolate aminomax whole cottonseed molasses and more “we’ve also expanded our loadout structures” says o’brien “we can now load roughly a ton load in just five minutes we offer delivery and pick up” strong industry ties pat o’brien  sons has fostered many longstanding relationships over the years with dairy farmers and feed mills “feed mills are one of our biggest customers” says o’brien “they buy our flaked corn and we buy protein mixes back from them to service our dairies we’ve formed good working alliances with many area feed mills” these relationships which often still come down to a simple handshake are key to success for pat o’brien  sons the company is also a member of the northeast agribusiness  feed alliance neafa which helps build industry connections “our membership with neafa is very helpful” says o’brien “we attend many meetings throughout the year and have the opportunity to meet with a number of the principals that work in the feed mills we deal with this strengthens our relationships with them” in an area where more ethanol plants have moved in making for greater corn competition building industry ties and staying at the forefront of the industry will equip pat o’brien  sons for the long haul “another thing we do is we work closely with cornell university’s ag division” adds o’brien “we attend nutrition conferences that help us stay on the cutting edge of dairy technology and allow us to do a better job for our customers” after  years pat o’brien  sons inc continues its tradition of serving the northeast dairy industry with the highest quality feeds with steamflaked corn as the golden ticket to animal efficiency and farm productivity click here to view the digital editionstrategic
