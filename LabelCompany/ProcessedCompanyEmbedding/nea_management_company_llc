headquartered and youll see how ingrained that dual citizenship istheyll think about it for a minute and then either admit they dont know or err on the side of their home office it makes for some fierce sports rivalries but it also makes us better investors we have crossfunctional crosscountry collaboration down to such a science its bordering on art we want to find and fund innovation at its source and innovation is everywhere that pursuit of innovation and great partnerships has led us to spend a lot more time in certain hubs and over the last few years nea has established small offices in new york and chicago menlo park innovation is everywhere but silicon valley is still the undisputed hub of the venture capital and startup ecosystemsand few would dispute that sand hill road is to venture capital what wall street is to the stock markets neas founding west coast office was in san francisco and while were active up and down the west coast sand hill road has been home since the mids washington dc neas east coast roots are spread across the metropolitan dc region with a founding office in baltimore and a second location in virginia our dual residency came to an end in  when our east coast investing staff moved into our current friendship heights location our operations team has stayed close to the firms baltimore roots with an office in nearby timonium san francisco in

collaborative and approachable work environment that serves as a landing place for nea team members and also provides us with an awesome spot to host meetings and events new york in recent years weve been spending more and more time in new york the regions vibrant startup ecosystem coupled with top tech and design talent has made it a hub for digital media and consumer internet companies we

established itself as a force within the innovation ecosystem we have a history of partnering with new englandbased startups and currently have over two dozen active portfolio companies in boston and surrounding areas in  we decided to formalize our relationship with the city by opening an office in the cambridge biopharma hub kendall square chicago our portfolio spans six continents but we have
