period in history for  years tupperware brand products have closely followed rollercoaster trends from the suburban movement to the s feminist revolution to s cocooning continually adding a unique organizational touch to the lives and kitchens across the nation just prior to its consumer introduction in  inventor earl tuppers plasticslike materials of many manufacturers were dedicated to the war effort the versatility and convenience of tuppers miracle products helped to launch the plastics revolution of the next decade tuppers first consumer plastic products the wonderlier® bowl and bell tumbler offered a unique benefit that traditional food containers did not they were lighter and less likely to break than traditional glass and crockery with the onset of the postwar baby boom women dedicated themselves to caring for their growing families the tupperized kitchen was born … a kitchen that was well organized and neat and featured a variety of containers that replaced unsightly open packages and that kept food fresh longer in  tupper introduced his legendary airtight seals patterned after the inverted rim on a can of paint which prevented food from drying out wilting or losing its flavor in the nowcommon refrigerator despite their breakthrough nature tuppers products didnt sell well in retail outlets primarily because consumers needed demonstrations in order to understand how they worked in response the first tupperware home party was held in  introducing an allnew way for tupperware products to reach consumers demonstrations proved a dramatically effective way of communicating the benefits of the revolutionary seal by  the tupperware home demonstration system was working so well that all tupperware products were taken off store shelves to be distributed in this manner the direct sales demonstration was a welcome diversion for women whose involvement in the community mostly revolved around their family selling tupperware products via the party sales method was an appealing career for these women who had few career opportunities after their men returned from the war as consumers relocated from large urban centers to homes in the suburbs backyard barbecues became a favorite way for families and neighbors to spend leisure time the new tupperware products answered needs created by this popular pastime the party bowl kept macaroni and egg salads fresh and cold outdoors while the pie taker provided easy transportation for homemade desserts the dip n serve™ serving tray functioned much the same way making it simple to get chips and dip to and from the backyard or the picnic site the s were times of social upheaval with the family undergoing social changes as twoincome families became more common women actively pursued career opportunities and tupperware filled the ensuing product niche with designs like the traveling desk drawer organizers and the plastic carrying case the huge wave of baby boomers that began having children of their own created a need for sturdy stimulating toys again tupperware rose to the challenge introducing an innovative line of toys like the shapeo® toy a funyeteducational design which challenged each stage of a childs development from functioning as a rattle for infants to promoting eyehand coordination in toddlers while the demand for specialized kitchen products soared tupperware kept pace with changing palates by offering storage products like the mix n stor® container and the tortilla keeper for serving ethnic dishes thanks to advances in medical technology consumers were living longer than ever before resulting in an increasing population of seniors during this era tupperware introduced the instant seal which catered to a mature population with notsonimble fingers this era also brought drastically changing lifestyles with more households than ever before requiring dual incomes to meet increasing economic demands more women went to work outside the home faced with balancing their roles in the office and the home a career in tupperware offered these new entrants to the workforce a flexible way to earn money and spend time with their children when microwave ovens first began entering kitchens tupperware introduced products designed specifically for both the microwave and conventional ovens once the microwave was fully accepted as a household appliance tupperware

family staple in keeping with the fastpaced s tupperware introduced products designed to maximize peoples time the tupperwave® stack cooker was designed to make a threecourse meal for four in the

airtight the oncepatented burping seal is a famous aspect of tupperware which distinguished it from competitors earl tupper invented the plastic for tupperware already in  but the product only worked with the emergence of the sale through presentation in a party setting in  tupperware introduced the wonderlier bowl that gave a start to a revolutionary range of kitchen utensils tupperware pioneered the direct marketing strategy made famous by the tupperware party the tupperware party allowed for women of the s to work and enjoy the benefits of earning an income without completely taking away the independence granted to women during the second world war when women first began entering the labor market all the while keeping their focus in the domestic domain the party model builds on characteristics generally developed by being a housewife eg party planning hosting a party sociable relations with friends and neighbors and created an alternative choice for women who either needed or wanted to work brownie wise – realized tupperwares potential as a fun commodity she realized however that she had to be creative and therefore started to throw these tupperware parties wise a former sales representative of stanley home products developed the strategy tupper was so impressed that brownie wise was made vice president of marketing in  wise soon created tupperware parties inc during the early s tupperwares sales and popularity exploded thanks in large part to wises influence among women who sold tupperware and some of the famous jubilees celebrating the success of tupperware ladies at lavish and outlandishly themed parties tupperware was known—at a time when women came back from working during world war ii only to be told to go back to the kitchen—as a method of empowering women and giving them a toehold in the postwar business world the tradition of tupperwares jubilee style events continues to this day with rallies being held in major cities to recognize and reward topselling and toprecruiting individuals teams and organizations in  earl tupper fired wise over general difference of opinion in the tupperware business operation officially tupper objected to the expenses incurred by the jubilee and other similar celebrations of tupperware however the real reason was that tupper had been approached by several companies interested in buying him out he felt that he would not be able to sell with a woman in an executive position rexall bought tupperware in  tupperware spread to europe in  when mila pond hosted a tupperware party in weybridge england and subsequently around the world at the time a strict dress code was required for tupperware ladies with skirts and stockings tights worn at all times and white gloves often accompanying the outfit a technique called carrot calling helped promote the parties representatives would travel door to door in a neighborhood and ask housewives to run an experiment in which carrots would be placed in a tupperware container and compared with anything that you would ordinarily leave it in it would often result in the scheduling of a tupperware party rexall sold its namesake drugstores in  and

historical impactedit typical authentic tupperware tupperware created a way for women to remain housewives while creating an independence from the home in a sociable atmosphere the reciprocity that emerges at the “parties” which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling studies show that the creation of the “tupperware party” is a gendered construct aimed at appeasing the general ethos of the domestic arrangements of the era where men were the sole earners and it was the womens responsibility to manage the housework it was the larkin company however that were the forerunners of these types of parties during the s that were popularized by such organizations as tupperware feminist views vary regarding the tupperware format of sales through parties and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the tupperware model opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking the positive feminist views consider that tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to the unequal gender laws in the workplace the company promoted the betterment of women and the endless opportunities tupperware offered to women whereas the negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career the emergence of tupperware on the american market created a new kind of opportunity to an entirely underrepresented labor demographic women and especially suburban housewives which subsequently facilitated the calls for equal rights between men and women in the workplacecitation needed product linesedit one of the tupperwares ultraplus line of products tupperwares product ranges are often marketed under different names in different markets and

tupperware created a way for women to remain housewives while creating an independence from the home in a sociable atmosphere the reciprocity that emerges at the “parties” which are traditionally composed of friends and family members of the hostess creates a nurturing atmosphere without a direct sales feeling studies show that the creation of the “tupperware party” is a gendered construct aimed at appeasing the general ethos of the domestic arrangements of the era where men were the sole earners and it was the womens responsibility to manage the housework it was the larkin company however that were the forerunners of these types of parties during the s that were popularized by such organizations as tupperware feminist views vary regarding the tupperware format of sales through parties and the social and economic role of women portrayed by the tupperware model opposing views state that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking the positive feminist views consider that tupperware provided work for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to the unequal gender laws in the workplace the company promoted the betterment of women and the endless opportunities tupperware offered to women whereas the negative view includes the restriction of women to the domestic sphere and limiting the real separation between running the household and a career the emergence of tupperware on the american market created a new kind of opportunity to an entirely
