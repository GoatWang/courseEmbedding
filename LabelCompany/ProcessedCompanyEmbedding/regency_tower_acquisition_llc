cash payment of  per unit representing the difference between pvr’s annualized quarterly distribution immediately prior to the merger and  times regency’s annualized quarter distribution immediately prior to the merger the combination creates a fullyintegrated midstream partnership platform by further expanding regency’s position in the granite wash in the midcontinent and adding a strong geographic footprint in the marcellus and utica shales in the appalachia basin this acquisition is expected to allow regency to benefit from increased scale enhanced geographic diversification and a growing feebased asset portfolio while delivering additional appealing service options to customers in addition the high level of producer activity around the combined asset base positions regency to capture additional upside from organic growth opportunities “this is a compelling strategic opportunity for regency and we are excited to see this merger come together” said mike bradley president and chief executive officer of regency “the addition of pvr’s asset base in the marcellus utica and granite wash supply areas provides regency with diversification into attractive highgrowth regions and also provides substantial opportunities for accretion through ongoing and proposed organic growth projects these projects are expected to provide a platform for growth in ebitda and dcf over the coming years which we believe strengthens our longterm distribution outlook” “i would also like to thank pvr’s management team for their support in seeing this transaction through” continued bradley “the combination of these assets and the addition of a talented employee base will further position regency as one of the premier midstream service providers in the country” the pvr assets include a network of natural gas midstream pipelines and processing plants located principally in two prolific producing areas—the marcellus and utica shales in appalachia and the granite wash in the midcontinent region—as well as coal and natural resource properties located in the appalachian illinois and san juan basins which are leased to experienced operators in exchange for royalty payments
