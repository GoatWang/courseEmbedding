linkedin whatsapp messenger new proposals from australia’s drug regulator should give you a better idea if your complementary medicines do what they say on the packet one change proposed by the therapeutic goods administration tga is a “stamp of approval” on the packaging and promotional material of some vitamins minerals herbs and other supplements to tell you there is enough evidence to back health claims other proposals include reducing the number of often unsubstantiated indications that manufacturers of complementary medicines currently make on their tga application which are then used as the basis for advertising claims the tga also proposes incentives for companies to develop and market products with new active ingredients or make new claims based on research the proposed changes which are out for public consultation follow the recent abc four corners program which highlighted longstanding problems with the way complementary medicines are currently regulated abc four corners’ documentary “swallowing it” highlights the shortcomings of how complementary medicines are regulated in australia what’s the problem the tga’s proposals are urgently needed to fix three major shortcomings of the current regulatory system first consumer organisations and health professionals have lost confidence in the complementary medicines industry’s ability to regulate its own advertisements and in the tga’s ability to apply adequate sanctions when companies don’t follow the rules second there is little incentive for the manufacturers of complementary medicines to research new innovative products or prove existing ones work there are about  listed complementary medicines on the australian register of therapeutic goods indicated by aust l on packaging listed medicines are meant to contain preapproved relatively lowrisk ingredients produced with good manufacturing practice and only make “lowlevel” health claims for which evidence is held however the tga does not check these requirements before the product is marketed postmarketing surveillance and upheld complaints show high levels of regulatory noncompliance but there are only  registered complementary medicines indicated by aust r on packaging the tga says have been thoroughly assessed for safety quality and efficacy there is also debate about whether many of these older products should still be on this tga list there are fewer products on this list because research to meet registration requirements is expensive the public doesn’t understand the subtleties between an aust l and aust r product and a better return on investment comes from promotional hype and celebrity endorsement of listed products third the tga provides only limited transparency about companies and products that fail postmarketing evaluation or have complaints upheld this information is currently regarded as commercialinconfidence fuelling the perception the tga is more concerned with helping industry than protecting consumers how could the new measures help the proposal to restrict companies to only making preapproved “lowlevel” indications and claims for a product such as “may relieve the pain of mild osteoarthritis” will minimise the risk of misleading consumers but it is not yet clear how the list of allowed indications will be established nor how a specific product will be matched with an appropriate allowed indication the regulator also proposes manufacturers apply for “intermediatelevel” health claims falling outside the permitted list outlined above an example might be “our formulation of cranberry reduces the frequency of recurrent urinary infections in women” for this the tga would have to assess the evidence substantiating the claim for a particular product if the evidence stacks up and there’s a debate about the type of evidence needed the product could then carry a tga “stamp of approval” on the label and any promotional material but it is not clear what this “stamp of approval” will be is it text a symbol or both not everyone agrees a tga ‘stamp of approval’ should be in the form of a symbol like this unofficial mockup created by ken harvey in preliminary tga stakeholder consultations consumer representatives supported a prominent visual identifier like a logo or symbol because of the failure of the existing aust l and aust r labelling to inform consumers but industry representatives were concerned a highly visible identifier for a small number of evidencebased complementary medicines might affect sales of the bulk of listed products without one the tga’s proposals encourage innovation because they will stimulate companies to engage in research to qualify for a tga “stamp of approval” the proposal also suggests companies that develop a tga approved evidencebased claim would be awarded a threeyear period of data protection to stop others freeloading on their research but the proposed changes do not yet address the need for greater transparency in the regulatory process for instance it is not clear whether the tga’s assessment of evidence to back higherlevel health claims for complementary medicines will be publicly available as they are for prescription medicines what happens next these proposed changes which are out for public consultation until march   sit alongside other recommendations aimed at improving the advertising complaints system if the tga implements this package of recommendations australia will be a world leader in how complementary medicines are regulated despite the substantial and increasing use of supplements no other country has developed a system that helps consumers and health professionals separate the evidencebased wheat from the chaff improves confidence in the industry stimulates more

harvey in challenging shonky therapeutic products and keeping the public informed个人this page is run only by supporters of ken harvey and was set up without request we also support the great work ken does and the many contributions he has made whilst kens problems with the initial catalyst for this page genesis have passed as of february th  his work and wonderfully educational commentary continues  what follows is the original biography for this page sensaslim is an alternative weight loss product that has drawn much media attention in australia giving the public an impression of seemingly miraculous success apart from making claims that defied the accepted science of weight loss the marketers of sensaslim claimed via a slick advertising campaign video and website to have evidence gained from a clinical trial involving  people that the product was perhaps the greatest weight loss product in the world in a may st  article the australian skeptics revealed that dr ken harvey  an adjunct senior lecturer in the school of public health la trobe university  had complained to the therapeutic goods administration over promotion of the product this resulted in a strategic lawsuit against public participation known as a slapp suit being lodged against ken harvey which causes significant financial and personal pressure in a statement to the tgas complaints resolution panel dr harvey substantially backed his position that “in my opinion the ‘sensational results’ claimed are most likely to have been fabricated in addition i do not believe that any of the other claims made for this product are capable of substantiation” before the crp could deliberate adequately sensaslim issued a statement of claim in the nsw supreme court this alleged defamation against dr harvey seeking “general and punitive damages for libel in the sum of ” plus costs as reported by the australian skeptics due to a clause in the therapeutic goods regulations  zcaj  this puts a temporary but potentially lengthy stop to complaints heard by the crp as complaints can take months to reach conclusion the product is continued to be marketed and sold with no regard to its legitimacy or indeed any possible negative effects the relevant regulation states “if after a complaint has been made to the panel a proceeding begins in a court about the subject matter of the complaint the panel cannot deal with the complaint until the proceeding is finally disposed of” crucially sensaslim until may st  had dr matthew capehorn clinical director of the national obesity forum uk and clinical manager of the rotherham institute for obesity as their own research director as part of this role dr capehorn wrote and published a white paper on the unseen clinical trial evidence in good faith through his lawyers capehorn has written to sensaslim stating in part despite requests i have never seen evidence of the original clinical trial and it has never been published in a peer reviewed medical journal therefore the white paper holds no scientific relevance until that original trial is published” sensaslim have made numerous breaches of contract with dr capehorn and have not acquiesced to his demands to remove his image name and white paper from their website you can read more about this at the australian skeptics by following
