funds private equity liquid alts people moves regulation halls of justice institutional tech  services indices in depth contributors lifestyle qa sts partners aims to build on recent success feb    pm et sts partners was one of those rare things in  a hedge fund that produced doubledigit returns the steamboat springs coloradobased firm which specializes in distressed assetbacked securities saw its  billion sts partners fund return over  last year ranking third in bloombergs top  hedge funds with over  billion its second fund the  million burgess creek also generated doubledigit returns last year so it will come as no surprise that the firm is preparing to launch new products in  to find out more about sts partners winning year—and its future plans—finalternatives recently spoke with managing director will bashan and portfolio manager and cio scott burg what is the difference between the burgess creek fund and the sts partners fund which did very well last year but is closed to new investors scott burgburg basically the difference between the two funds is sts is a much more binary highyield higher risk reward type of scenariowhen we were looking at the bonds youd have to run the bonds to really see what fit where and we started to see we were passing up all these bonds that have a little bit more credit enhancement can actually allow more of a fundamental story to take place have a longer average life so theyll be outstanding longer and were passing these bonds all up and we finally said this doesnt make any sense because while the current yield on these bonds is lower the total return component is very attractive these types of bonds within both residential and commercial mortgages are going to be higher up in the capital structure theyre going to be more liquid have a little bit more transparency but what we like about them is they allow the fundamentals to play out over a longer period of time and one of the things that were really seeing in terms of the fundamentals is we dont necessarily need housing to be increasing at    a year even in a flat housing environment these bonds are becoming more and more seasoned—the youngest bonds now are  youre going on eight years of seasoning so what youre left with is a lot of the bad stuff is being flushed through and a lot of the good stuff is left thats the thesis or the investment premise behind burgess when last we spoke in  you used the word phenomenal to describe the potential of the assetbacked securities market would you still describe it that way burg i would not repeat the word phenomenal i think in  i was correct if you would have put  billion in the securities we were talking about in  you would be a happy camper but what i will say about the opportunities iswe have to be more opportunistic in the areas where were going so over the last months were finding what we see as gems in a lot of different areas its not just mortgagebacked it also could be commercial real estate one of the things weve been adding is newissue structured aircraft backed by aircraft or even aircraft parts it could be manufacture housing could be a franchise deal it could be a cdo it could be a derivativewe still see very strong opportunities within structured products but i think now not only are you betting on the strong horse butits very important what jockey youre picking because weve seen a significant runup in many of these assets and some of them we see prices that we just dont think are going to be justified by the cashflow so while theres areas where were seeing incredible opportunities at the same time youre seeing trades that are making you scratch your head what is an example of a gem you discovered in  burg one of the things going into  in our macro view that was definitely against the herd was our view on interest rates throughout  i dont know if thats just being out in steamboat laughs but our view was that interest rates would not only stay low but the whole curve would compress and flattenso with that macro view about what was going to happen with interest rates one of the areas that we found that was very undervalued to that expected scenario was the nonagency interestonly securities and so that was our major theme throughout  it was wildly successful basically in these securities in the subprime arena as interest rates come down or flatten out theres more money that goes in to pay these securities as interest rates go up theres less money and they perform more poorly so this was definitely a trade that we put on through  and continue to put on selectively in  thathas had a lot of value can you see burgess eventually closing to new investors will bashanbashan given the strategy and where it is in the capital structure we could see it closing at some point but right now thats very far off—it may be  or  billion but at the end of the day we approach all our investments and everything we do by letting the market tell us what to do and so we dont like to draw a hard line in the sand one way or another but right now were still really excited about the opportunities within burgess and want to continue to grow the assets do you have any new products planned burg yes theres actually two things that we have on our plate going into  one isnt necessarily different from burgess its going to be a burgess creek irish fund to allow us to raise money out of europe and pretty much that whole section of the world its going to have a similar strategy to burgess creek the way were looking at it is that its a sister fund that allows us access to capital that we otherwise would not be able to get the other opportunity that were becoming more and more excited about is a singlemanager meaning us mutual fundhow burgess creek came into development its kind of the same way with the mutual fund as we are continuously looking at these bonds and were saying wow this is actually really interesting yield especially given the world and the worlds rate of returns right now and you go this doesnt necessarily fit burgess but jeez the right investor would absolutely like this type of return and at the same time were running these bonds anyway so were excited to hopefully be launching that in the summer of  bashan weve been a subadvisor for a  act fund for about two yearsand the strategy has performed very very well so what we want to do is roll that out—again we would just be the subadvisor wed partner with a distribution entity—but we would roll out that strategy that weve had going for now two years so theres already a pretty impressive track record is the irish fund a way of dealing with europes alternative investment fund managers directive bashan we chose as a firm not to be aifmd compliant so that effectively shuts us out of the european market we actually are going to partner with one of our larger investors thats based in new york and london they will be aifmd compliant theyre the ones that will be getting the fund up and running and well be a subadvisor so it allows us to do what we do which is manage the money and not have the burden of aifmd to deal with did you consider becoming aifmd compliant bashan its certainly a burden and its not something we couldnt handle but we chose not to because quite honestly we see so much opportunity in the us market and other markets that it was just hard to justify the resources for that when we still havent really tapped into a large part of the us market is the mutual fund an attempt to tap into the growing appetite for liquid alternative products bashan when you look at todays market environment and yields being so low we think theres a very high demand for this product—which is basically decent yield protection against rates risingplus we have a pretty goodsized investor base currently its not a  act investor base naturally but a lot of our investors would love to have us run a more liquid product so theres a builtin client base or demand that we can satisfy currently if we have a singlemanager type product email this print this order reprints twitter linkedin facebook related links qa deer park closes one

motion of defendants deutsche bank securities inc db securities and deutsche mortgage securities inc db mortgage together with db securities the db defendants to dismiss the supplemental complaint as against them and granted defendant wells fargo bank nas motion to dismiss all claims except the third cause of action as against it unanimously modified on the law to grant wells fargos motion to dismiss the third cause of action to the extent it is not based on the irr threshold and otherwise affirmed without costs all claims against the db defendants were correctly dismissed based on the noaction clause in the trust agreements quadrant structured prods co ltd v vertin  nyd   which plaintiffs cite did not involve the termination of a trust read in context the sentence on which plaintiffs rely the noaction clause applies when the trustee is authorized to decide whether to act it cannot serve as an outright prohibition on a suit filed by a securityholder in the case where the trustee is without authorization to act id at  means that a noaction clause does not bar claims — such as breach of fiduciary duty against a corporations board of directors — that an indenture trustee cannot bring notably the court of appeals ruled that those claims sounding in breach of contract and arising from the indenture are barred — requiring the majority securityholders to bring those actions through the trustee id at  the claims that were dismissed included breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and tortious interference with that covenant id at  n  unlike the claims in quadrant that were not dismissed plaintiffs claims all arise out of the trust agreements and the amendments thereto even if arguendo plaintiffs were thirdparty beneficiaries of the trust agreements see walnut place llc v countrywide home loans inc  misc d a  ny slip op u  n  sup ct ny county  affd  add  st dept  the noaction clause would still apply see  add at  so much of the third cause of action as alleged that wells fargo breached the trust agreements by executing the amendments made by it and db mortgage was correctly dismissed because the plain language of section av of the trust agreements permitted those amendments see generally quadrant  nyd at  so much of the third cause of action as alleges that certificateholder consent was required to terminate the rs trust should also be dismissed because as sections  and  show certificateholder consent was not the only way in which the trust could terminate the third cause of action should also be dismissed as against wells fargo based on anything other than the irr threshold both the original and amended trust agreements provide that an auction of the underlying certificates must yield at least the minimum auction call amount of the five components of minimum auction call amount only one — the irr threshold — relates to the certificates held by plaintiffs the class ax certificates plaintiffs contend that in addition to the irr threshold they had the right to receive a principal distribution amount a payment under the cap agreements and the class ax distribution amount for the final month of the rs trusts existence however the documentary evidence submitted by defendants shows that as early as december   the class ax certificateholders had received their principal back the supplemental complaint does not allege that plaintiffs were entitled to any amounts under the cap agreements and plaintiffs may not raise this issue for the first time on appeal because the issue might have been obviated by the submission of documentary evidence tachotani v doubleclick inc  add  st dept  with respect to the class ax distribution amount plaintiffs admit that they received distributions from the rs trust through august  the trust was terminated on or about september   hence there was no distribution date on september   by definition a class ax distribution amount depends on a distribution date the final distribution date depends on a notice pursuant to section  which was never delivered with respect to the irr threshold wells fargo submitted documentary evidence that as of august   the internal rate of return irr for the rs class ax certificates was more than  and the irr for the rs class ax certificates was more than  however the underlying certificates for the rs trust were auctioned on september   and the underlying certificates for the rs trust were auctioned on october   since the trust agreements define irr as an annual rate the  reports from pricewaterhousecoopers do not utterly refute plaintiffs factual allegations or conclusively establish a defense as a matter of law see eg goshen v mutual life ins co of ny  nyd    the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was correctly dismissed as against wells fargo because section ei of the trust agreements states no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this agreement against the trustee see hotel  mezz lender llc v mitchell  add   st dept  wells fargos failure to exercise due care in performing ministerial tasks does not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty see ag capital funding partners lp v state st bank  trust co  nyd    nor does the supplemental complaint state a cause of action for fiduciary duty based on conflict of interest while an indenture trustees predefault duty to avoid conflicts of interest    is a fiduciary duty commerce bank v bank of ny mellon  add   st dept  plaintiffs made only conclusory allegations that wells fargo received more under the rs amendment than it would have received under the original trust agreement see id with respect to rs defendants explained the amendments  basis points in their opening letter brief and as the court noted plaintiffs failed to respond to this in their opposition letter brief in any event the fiduciary duty claim is duplicative of the contract claim see ag capital funding partners lp v state st bank  trust co  add   st dept  mod on other grounds  nyd   we have considered plaintiffs and wells fargos remaining arguments and find that they do not warrant relief beyond the extent indicated

investor deer park road management is adjusting its product mix in response to redemption pressures and shifting investor demandthe  billion firm is unwinding one of its hedge funds called burgess creek after a large european investor asked to withdraw  million and is transferring most of the remaining investors to its flagship sts partners fund at the same time it is tweaking the fee and liquidity terms for sts partners amid sagging performancewith an annualized return of  since its  inception sts has been a bonanza for deer park road the fund has an unconventional fee structure with no management fee instead limited partners pay a  performance fee on the first  of the fund’s profits the rate drops to a standard  of any subsequent profitsbut the fund’s returns aren’t what they once were sts gained  last year while that was well above the industry average it was the first time the fund’s fullyear return was below  until august sts hadn’t had a down month for  consecutive months but yeartodate it is down  as of april that helps explain why deer park road is reopening sts to outside investors for the first time in four years and amending the fees and liquidity terms applicable to new investments — including the assets moving over from the nowunwinding burgess creek newcomers will pay the industrystandard  management fee and  performance fee they’ll also be subject to a oneyear “soft” lockup during which they’d have to pay a  penalty on any withdrawals burgess creek investors had been used to a monthly redemption schedulethe changes apparently aren’t sitting well with some investors limited partners representing nearly threequarters of the capital in burgess creek have opted to transfer to sts most of the rest have asked the manager to liquidate their assets — a process that’s expected to take months considering that deer park road specializes in illiquid “odd lot” mortgagebacked securities“i know that some investors in burgess creek didn’t want to wait    for their money back nor did they want distribution in kind so they planned to move from burgess to sts and then immediately redeem from sts hoping that they could get out faster when part of the larger fund” a source said “they’re not waiting for the lockup to be over they’d rather pay the redemption fee and get money asap”but a source close to the steamboat springs colo firm said most burgess creek investors were eager to transfer to sts and so far have shown no signs of wanting to withdraw “no one has done that” he said “i’d be very surprised at that”still sts has been hit by redemption requests including  million for april and  million for may it is bracing for another  million of withdrawals in june and about  million in july the fund had  billion under management as of march “it should be noted that while the pace of redemptions has increased somewhat in the near term this has not presented any change to our portfoliomanagement strategy” the firm wrote in an investor letter distributed last month “of note through the first three months of the year the balance of redemptions backfill contributions and cashflow on the portfolio holdings has generated a positive increase of approximately  million while the coming periods account for some incremental increase in outflows they represent a relatively small portion of the overall fund size and are mitigated by the increase in portfolio cashflows”in reopening sts deer park road hopes to raise  million to  million — in addition to the assets transferring from burgess creek so far it has taken in  million of fresh capitaldeer park road launched burgess creek in  to offer investors a lessvolatile version of its sts strategy while nearly  of burgess creek’s positions also are held by sts the balance of its holdings are higherrated mortgage securities that tend to be more liquid through april burgess creek was showing an annualized return of  but yeartodate it was down in december  a danish pension began withdrawing its entire  million investment from burgess creek at the time the fund had a little more than  million as a result of the redemption which was to be executed over six months other investors would have held increasingly large percentages of the fund that coupled with investor demand for sts was enough for deer park road to pull the plug on burgess creek in doing so it offered limited partners three exit options transferring to sts liquidating their stakes over  months or receiving inkind payments of assets only one investor opted for a payment in kindthe changes to sts’ fee and liquidity terms were designed to make the fund more attractive to pension consultants and other advisors to institutional investors they have shied away from sts due in part to the perception of a liquidity mismatch between the underlying assets and the fund’s monthly redemption schedule there also was a concern that without a management fee the firm might be vulnerable to periods of low or negative returnsseveral sources suggested deer park road may have had an ulterior motive in ushering burgess creek investors to sts because the funds have similar portfolios liquidating burgess creek could have dented the values of the underlying securities which in turn would have hurt the performance of ststhe maneuver also has rekindled skepticism among some observers about the ability of sts to generate such consistently strong returns “the firm has too perfect of a return profile since its  launch” one source saiddeer park road is led by founder michael craigscheckman and chief investment officer scott burg craigscheckman previously was a portfolio manager at millennium management before joining deer park road burg cofounded an assetvaluation shop called clayton ips now known as mountainview ips among mountainview’s clients is deer park road scott gibson who became head of marketing for deer park road earlier this year previously worked at
