management strategy current views and assumptions such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein all of the above risks could affect the group’s future ability to achieve its financial targets which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today use of the words believes anticipates and expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements including the group’s expectations regarding future events including regulatory filings and determinations moreover the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions which may alter these parameters these objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the group these targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future and not exclusively on historical data actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets notably for regulatory or competition reasons the group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share furthermore the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums therefore the group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned there can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to general industry conditions and competition general economic factors including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation global trends toward health care cost containment technological advances new products and patents attained by competitors challenges inherent in new product development including obtaining regulatory approval the groups ability to accurately predict future market conditions manufacturing difficulties or delays financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk dependence on the effectiveness of the group’s patents and other protections for innovative products and the exposure to litigation including patent litigation andor regulatory actions the group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the group’s activities and financial results the group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations it might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements a default by any of the group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected such situations could have a negative impact on the group’s business financial position or performance the group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events conditions assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based unless so required by applicable law the group’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in

therapy appendix risk factors the group operates in an environment which is undergoing rapid change and exposes its operations to a number of risks some of which are outside its control the risks and uncertainties set out below are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the group’s  registration document available on its website wwwipsencom the group is faced with uncertainty in relation to the prices set for all its products in so far as medication prices have come under severe pressure over the last few years as a result of various factors including the tendency for governments and payers to reduce prices or reimbursement rates for certain drugs marketed by the group in the countries in which it operates or even to remove those drugs from lists of reimbursable drugs the group depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which generates or may generate substantial royalties for the group but these third parties could behave in ways that cause damage to the group’s business the group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfill their obligations it might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements a default by any of the group’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected such situations could have a negative impact on the group’s business financial position or performance actual results may depart significantly from the objectives given that a new product can appear to be promising at a development stage or after clinical trials but never be launched on the market or be launched on the market but fail to sell notably for regulatory or competitive reasons the research and development process typically lasts between eight and twelve years from the date of discovery to a product being brought to market this process involves several stages at each stage there is a substantial risk that the group could fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts in respect of products in which it has invested significant amounts thus in order to develop viable products from a commercial point of view the group must demonstrate by means of preclinical and clinical trials that the molecules in question are effective and are not harmful to humans the group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will subsequently be confirmed during clinical trials or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product in question such that the required marketing approvals can be obtained the group must deal with or may have to deal with competition i from generic products particularly in relation to group products which are not protected by patents ii products which although they are not strictly identical to the group’s products or which have not demonstrated their bioequivalence may obtain a marketing authorization for indications similar to those of the group’s products pursuant to the bibliographic reference regulatory procedure well established medicinal use before the patents protecting its products expire such a situation could result in the group losing market share which could affect its current level of growth in sales or profitability third parties might claim the benefit of intellectual property rights with respect to the group’s inventions the group provides the third parties with which it collaborates including universities and other public or private entities with information and data in various forms relating to the research development manufacturing and marketing of its products despite the precautions taken by the group with regard to these entities in particular of a contractual nature they or certain of their members or affiliates could claim ownership of intellectual property rights arising from the trials carried out by their employees or any other intellectual property right relating to the group’s products or molecules in development the group’s strategy includes acquiring companies or assets which may enable or facilitate access to new markets research projects or geographical regions or enable the group to realize synergies with its existing businesses should the growth prospects or earnings potential of such assets as well as valuation assumptions change materially from initial assumptions the group might be under the obligation to adjust the values of these assets in its balance sheet thereby negatively impacting its results and financial situation the marketing of certain products by the group has been and could be affected by supply shortages and other disruptions such difficulties may be of both a regulatory nature the need to correct certain technical problems in order to bring production sites into compliance with applicable regulations and a technical nature difficulties in obtaining supplies of satisfactory quality or difficulties in manufacturing active ingredients or drugs complying with their technical specifications on a sufficiently reliable and uniform basis this situation may result in inventory shortages andor in a significant reduction in the sales of one or more products in certain countries exposed to significant public deficits and where the group sells its drugs directly to public hospitals the group could face discount or lengthened payment terms or difficulties in recovering its receivables in full the group closely monitors the evolution of the situation in southern europe where hospital payment terms are especially long more generally the group may also be unable to purchase sufficient credit insurance to protect itself adequately against the risk of payment default from certain customers worldwide such situations could negatively impact the group’s activities financial situation and results in the normal course of business the group is or may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings financial claims are or may be brought against the group in connection with some of these proceedings the cash pooling arrangements for foreign subsidiaries outside the euro zone expose the group to financial foreign exchange risk the variation of these exchange rates may impact significantly the group’s results view source version on businesswirecom httpwwwbusinesswirecomnewshomeen source ipsen ipsen media didier véron      senior
