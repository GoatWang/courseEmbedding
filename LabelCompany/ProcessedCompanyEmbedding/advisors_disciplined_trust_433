might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected  the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the types of bond in the portfolio are listed under types of bonds on page   we do not actively manage the portfolio

if any the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in a trust reduced by the liabilities of a trust divided by the total units outstanding we often refer to the public offering price of units as the offer price or purchase price the offer price will be effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time if we receive your order prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or authorized financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and

costs during the initial offering period part of the value of the units represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six months if earlier the value of your units will decline when the trust pays these costs accrued interest accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a security from the last day it paid interest accrued interest on the trust units consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from the last day on which interest was paid on the bonds interest on the bonds is generally paid semiannually although the trust accrues such interest daily because your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement the second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the trusts interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust and may be required to advance its own funds to make trust interest distributions as a result interest account balances are established to limit the need for the trustee to advance funds in connection with such interest distributions if  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th you sell or redeem your units you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of your units value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of securities during the initial offering period based on the aggregate offering side evaluations of the securities determined a on the basis of current offering prices of the securities b if offering prices are not available for any particular security on the basis of current offering prices for comparable securities c by determining the value of securities on the offer side of the market by appraisal or d by any combination of the above after the initial offering period ends we generally determine the value of the securities as described in the preceding sentence based on the bid side evaluations rather than the offering side evaluations the offering side price generally represents the price at which investors in the market are willing to sell a security and the bid side evaluation generally represents the price that investors in the market are willing to pay to buy a security the bid side evaluation is lower than the offering side evaluation as a result of this pricing method unitholders should expect a decrease in the net asset value per unit on the day following the end of the initial offering period equal to the difference between the current offering side evaluation and bid side evaluation of the securities capelogic inc an independent pricing service determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this

public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units after the end of the initial offering period the maximum sales fee for secondary market transactions is based on the number of years remaining to the dollarweighted average maturity of the securities in your trust for purposes of this computation securities will be deemed to mature either on their stated maturity dates or an earlier date if a they have been called for redemption or funds have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call date or b such securities are subject to a mandatory tender the effect of this method of sales fee computation will be that different sales fee rates will be applied in accordance with the following schedule secondary average

these types of bonds general obligation bonds certain of the bonds in your trust may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are secured by the taxing power of the entity general obligation bonds are backed by the issuers pledge of its full faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest the taxing power of any governmental entity may be limited however

certain of the bonds in your trust may be revenue bonds that are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes if any the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project or authority falters because that income is the only source of payment the following types of

the availability of any appropriation is subject to the willingness or ability of the governmental entity to continue to make such special appropriations or to reimpose such special taxes the obligation to make lease payments exists only to the extent of the monies available to the governmental entity therefor and no liability is incurred by the governmental entity beyond the monies so appropriated once an annual appropriation is made the governmental entitys obligation to make lease rental payments is absolute and unconditional regardless of any circumstances or occurrences which might arise in the event of nonappropriation certificateholders or bondowners sole remedy absent credit enhancement generally is limited to repossession of the collateral for resale or releasing in the event of nonappropriation the sponsor may instruct the trustee to sell such bonds airport port and highway bonds certain facility revenue bonds are payable from and secured by the revenues from the ownership and operation of particular facilities such as airports highways and port authorities airport operating income may be affected by the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under the agreements with airports similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as use fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors and increased cost of maintenance or decreased use of a facility the sponsor cannot predict what effect conditions may have on revenues which are dependent for payment on these bonds capital improvement facility bonds your trust may contain bonds which are in the capital improvement facilities category capital improvement bonds are bonds issued to provide funds to assist political subdivisions or agencies of a state through acquisition of the underlying debt of a state or local political subdivision or agency the risks of an investment in such bonds include the risk of possible prepayment or failure of payment of proceeds on and default of the underlying debt convention facility bonds your trust may contain bonds of issuers in the convention facilities category bonds in the convention facilities category include special limited obligation bonds issued to finance convention and sports facilities payable from rental payments and annual governmental appropriations the governmental agency is not obligated to make payments in any year in which the monies have not been appropriated to make such payments in addition these facilities are limited use facilities that may not be used for purposes other than as convention centers or sports facilities correctional facility bonds your

education may affect an institutions ability to make payment on its own hospital and health care facility bonds the ability of hospitals and other health care facilities to meet their obligations with respect to revenue bonds issued on their behalf is dependent on various factors some such factors are the level of payments received from private thirdparty payors and government programs and the cost of providing health care services there can be no assurance that payments under governmental programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs associated with their bonds it also may be necessary for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its facilities equipment personnel and services hospitals and other health care facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that a claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that insurance coverage will be available to a facility housing bonds multifamily housing revenue bonds and single family mortgage revenue bonds are state and local housing issues that have been issued to provide financing for various housing projects multifamily housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to housing projects for low to moderate income families singlefamily mortgage revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring notes secured by mortgages on residences the ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations may be affected by various economic and noneconomic factors such factors include occupancy levels adequate rental income in multifamily projects the rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issues and the ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims all single family mortgage revenue bonds and certain multifamily housing revenue bonds are prepayable over the life of the underlying mortgage or mortgage pool therefore the average life of housing obligations cannot be determined however the average life of these obligations will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities mortgage loans are frequently partially or completely prepaid prior to their final stated maturities to the extent that these obligations were valued at a premium when a unitholder purchased units any prepayment at par would result in a loss of capital to the unitholder and reduce the amount of income that would otherwise have been paid to unitholders industrial development revenue bonds idrs idrs including pollution control revenue bonds are taxexempt bonds issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities idrs are not general obligations of governmental entities backed by their taxing power issuers are only obligated to pay amounts due on the idrs to the extent that funds are available from the unexpended proceeds of the idrs or receipts or revenues of the issuer payment of idrs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor such corporate operators or guarantors

legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year these bonds are also subject to the risk of abatement in many states as rental bonds cease in the event that damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee also in the event of default by the lessee government there may be significant legal andor practical difficulties involved in the reletting or sale of the project moral obligation bonds your trust may also include moral obligation bonds if an issuer of moral obligation bonds is unable to meet its obligations the repayment of the bonds becomes a moral commitment but not a legal obligation of the state or municipality in question thus such a commitment generally requires appropriation by the state legislature and accordingly does not constitute a legally enforceable obligation of debt of the state the agencies or authorities generally have no taxing power power bonds the ability of utilities to meet their obligations with respect to bonds they issue is dependent on various factors these factors include the rates they may charge their customers the demand for a utilitys services and the cost of providing those services utilities may also be subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates which they may charge customers utilities can experience regulatory political and consumer resistance to rate increases utilities engaged in longterm capital projects are especially sensitive to regulatory lags in granting rate increases utilities are additionally subject to increased costs due to governmental environmental regulation and decreased profits due to increasing competition any difficulty in obtaining timely and adequate rate increases could adversely affect a utilitys results of operations the sponsor cannot predict at this time the ultimate effect of such factors on the ability of any issuers to meet their obligations with respect to bonds refunded bonds refunded bonds are typically secured by direct obligations of the us government or in some cases obligations guaranteed by the us government placed in an escrow account maintained by an independent party until maturity or a predetermined redemption date these obligations are generally noncallable prior to maturity or the predetermined redemption date in a few isolated instances to date however bonds which were thought to be escrowed to maturity have been called for redemption prior to maturity solid waste disposal bonds bonds issued for solid waste disposal facilities are generally payable from tipping fees and from revenues that may be earned by the facility on the sale of electrical energy generated in the combustion of waste products the ability of solid waste disposal facilities to meet their obligations depends upon the continued use of the facility the successful and efficient operation of the facility and in the case of wastetoenergy facilities the continued ability of the facility to generate electricity on a commercial basis also increasing environmental regulation of the federal state and local level has a significant impact on waste disposal facilities while

special tax bonds special tax bonds are payable for and secured by the revenues derived by a municipality from a particular tax examples of special taxes are a tax on the rental of a hotel room on the purchase of food and beverages on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the municipality and they do not represent general obligations of the municipality payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by a reduction in revenues realized from the underlying special tax also should spending on the particular goods or services that are subject to the special tax decline the municipality may be under no obligation to increase the rate of the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues are raised from the shrinking taxable base tax allocation bonds tax allocation bonds are typically secured by incremental tax revenues collected on property within the areas where redevelopment projects financed by bond proceeds are located bond payments are expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived from higher assessed values of property resulting from development in the particular project area and not from an increase in tax rates special risk considerations include variations in taxable values of property in the project area successful appeals by property owners of assessed valuations substantial delinquencies in the payment of property taxes or imposition of any constitutional or legislative property tax rate decrease transit authority bonds mass transit is generally not selfsupporting from fare revenues additional financial resources must be made available to ensure operation of mass transit systems as well as the timely payment of debt service often such financial resources include federal and state subsidies lease rentals paid by funds of the state or local government or a pledge of a special tax if fare revenues or the additional financial resources do not increase appropriately to pay for rising operating expenses the ability of the issuer to adequately service the debt may be adversely affected water and sewer revenue bonds water and sewer bonds are generally payable from user fees the ability of state and local water and sewer authorities to meet their obligations may be affected by a number of factors some such factors are the failure of municipalities to utilize fully the facilities constructed by these authorities declines in revenue from user charges the possible inability to obtain rate increases rising construction and maintenance costs impact of environmental requirements the difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs the impact of no growth zoning ordinances and the continued availability of federal and state financial assistance and of municipal bond insurance for future bond issues liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will

delivered to the trust after the trusts first settlement date normally three business days after the trusts inception date delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis of any bonds delivered after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them original issue discount bonds original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value market discount your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market values were below the principal value on the trusts inception date or your unit purchase date a primary reason for the market value of such bonds being less than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a lower rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds bonds selling at market discounts tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity a market discount taxexempt bond held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable ordinary income and less in the form of taxexempt income than a comparable bond bearing interest at current market rates premium bonds your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market values were above the principal value on the trusts inception date or your unit purchase date a primary reason for the market value of such bonds being higher than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a higher rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds understanding your investment  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the principal value becomes payable because part of the purchase price is effectively returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption

guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the trust units each bond insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that a bond insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made most bond insurance companies have recently had their credit ratings downgraded or placed on review for possible downgrade by recognized credit rating agencies such as standard  poors and moodys investor services inc while many insurance companies have historically maintained a aaa credit rating most insurance companies are currently assigned a credit rating below this level to the extent that the issuer of a bond in your trust portfolio does

any order for units in whole or in part we may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or redeem them we may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to create units taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into four categories exemptinterest dividends ordinary income distributions capital gains dividends and return of capital exemptinterest dividends generally are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes some or all of the exemptinterest dividends however may be taken into account in determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences eg they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are taxed ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units see capital gains and losses below for information about the capital gains tax rate to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat certain distributions made to you in january understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units further if you hold your shares for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a share will be disallowed to the extent of the exempt interest dividends you received capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be disallowed to the extent of the exemptinterest dividends you received to the extent if any it is not disallowed it will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income further because the trust pays exemptinterest dividends which are treated as exempt interest for federal income tax purposes you will not be able to deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to purchase or carry your shares  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th expenses your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations the fees and expenses section of the investment summary in this prospectus shows the estimated amount of these expenses your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services the trustee also benefits when

joint return and entitled to four personal exemptions and to approximately  for taxpayers filing a single return entitled to only one personal exemption these limitations are subject to certain

advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york mellon as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in principal amounts which will generally maintain the same original percentage relationship among the principal amounts of the securities in such trust established by the initial deposit of the securities thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same principal amount of each security and the percentage relationship among the principal amount of each security in the related trust will generally remain the same if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income exempt from united states federal personal income tax and to provide capital preservation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of longterm municipal bonds there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the trust portfolio consists of interestbearing obligations issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the united states and political subdivisions and authorities thereof the interest on which is excludable from gross income for united states federal personal income tax purposes under existing law in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuer of the bonds the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in the special circumstances discussed herein regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities thus with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in accordance with their terms the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under normal circumstances the sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market factors including advance refunding so that in the opinion of the sponsor the retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of the unitholders the proceeds from any such sales exclusive of any portion which represents accrued interest will be credited to the principal account of such trust for distribution to the unitholders the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of securities to issue new securities or to exchange securities for trust securities the trustee shall reject such offer however should any issuance exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or without an initial offer any securities or property received shall be deposited in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor advises the trustee to keep such securities or properties the excess cash proceeds of any such sales will be distributed to unitholders  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the sponsor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the principal account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract including those securities purchased on a when as and if issued basis failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a when as and if issued or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place after the first settlement date accordingly the delivery of such securities may be delayed or may not occur interest on these securities begins accruing to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery unitholders of all trusts

in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the principal and accrued interest attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such principal  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust whether or not a replacement security is acquired an amount equal to the accrued interest at the coupon rate of the failed securities will be paid to unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the failed securities from the trust if the sponsor determines not to purchase a replacement security or to the date of substitution if a replacement security is purchased all such interest paid to unitholders which accrued after the date of settlement for a purchase of units will be paid by the sponsor in the event a replacement security could not be acquired by a trust the net annual interest income per unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return and estimated longterm return might be lowered subsequent to the trusts inception a security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trusts inception neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination to direct the trustee to dispose of such investment the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the happening of certain extraordinary circumstances certain of the securities may be subject to optional call or mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions in each case prior to their stated maturity a bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer often at a premium over par a refunding is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed at or before maturity by the proceeds of a new bond issue a bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par with proceeds from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue to maturity special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances redemption pursuant to optional call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to special or extraordinary redemption provisions may occur when the securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par that is when they are able to be refinanced at a lower cost the proceeds from any such call or redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions as well as proceeds from the sale of securities and from securities which mature in accordance with their terms from a trust unless utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption will be distributed to unitholders of such trust and will not be used to purchase additional securities for such trust accordingly any such call redemption sale or maturity will reduce the size and diversity of a trust and the net annual interest income of such trust and may reduce the estimated current return and the estimated long term return the call redemption sale or maturity of securities also may have tax consequences to a unitholder certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trusts were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase the market discount of previously issued securities will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline the market discount of previously issued securities will be reduced other things being equal investors  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th should also note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount securities will be reduced a discount security held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and loss in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable security newly issued at current market rates market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the securities certain of the securities in the trust may be zero coupon bonds ie an original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current interest zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such obligation this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest currently to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors municipal bonds the trusts include certain types of bonds described below accordingly an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described in the prospectus neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under section a of the internal revenue code which section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon

bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced a bond purchased at a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable

rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the trust were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable bonds decrease the market premium of previously issued bonds will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market premium of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value certain of the bonds may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount

the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery to the extent any bonds are actually delivered to a trust after their respective expected dates of delivery unitholders who purchase their unit prior to the date such bonds are actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in their unit for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the interval between their purchase of unit and the actual delivery of such bonds as a result of any such adjustment the estimated current returns during the first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the prospectus which would be the returns after the first year assuming the portfolio of a trust and estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee which may be reduced in the

of its power of eminent domain to take all or substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or

reacquires the rights from such third party a third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights the sponsor is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds see also the discussion of single family mortgage and multifamily revenue bonds above for more information on the call provisions of such bonds to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date of deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon any of the trusts at any time after the trusts inception date litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted each trust has received or will receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds puerto rico your trust may significantly invest in bonds issued by issuers located in puerto rico accordingly an investment in such a trust should be made with an understanding of the general risks associated with the commonwealth of puerto rico economic conditions and outlook the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the us economy the following exogenous variables are affected by the us economy exports direct investment transfer payments interest rates inflation and tourist expenditures puerto rico has a diversified economy with manufacturing and services comprising its principal sectors manufacturing is the largest sector in terms of gross domestic product manufacturing in puerto rico is now more diversified than during the earlier phases of its industrial development and includes several industries less prone to business cycles in the last three decades industrial development has tended to be more capital intensive and more dependent on skilled labor the services sector which includes finance insurance real estate wholesale and retail trade tourism and other services has shown a strong interaction with manufacturing tourism construction and agriculture tourism makes a

billion as of june   a deterioration in the financial position of  billion from the prior years balances the accumulated deficit is principally the result of the commonwealths practice of issuing debt and transferring such funds to its discretely presented component units in order for them to carry out the corresponding construction programs and to borrowings made by the primary government of the commonwealth to cover operational needs puerto ricos total deficit increased by  billion a  increase in  the governmental activities deficit increased by  billion a  increase while net assets of the

invested mainly in us government securities stocks corporate bonds repurchase agreements commonwealth securities trading securities and shortterm investments these are primary government investments that are restricted and unrestricted budgetary policy the fiscal year of the commonwealth begins each july  the governor is constitutionally required to submit to the legislature an annual balanced budget of capital improvements and operating expenses of the central government for the ensuing fiscal year the annual budget is prepared by the puerto rico office of management and budget working with the puerto rico planning board the puerto rico department of the treasury and other government offices and agencies section  of article  of the constitution provides that the appropriations made for any fiscal year shall not exceed the total revenue including available surplus estimated for said fiscal year unless the imposition of taxes sufficient to cover said appropriations is provided by law the commonwealths budgeted expenditures for fiscal year  of  billion exceeded projected revenues of  billion by approximately  million the commonwealth expected to cover this budget deficit through the implementation of additional expenditure reducing measures a possible increase in tax revenues resulting from the reduction of the uncertainty surrounding the governments fiscal crisis and cash management mechanisms the possible increase in tax revenues was tempered by the adverse economic impact resulting from increases in the price of oil and the implementation of the sales and use tax the commonwealth maintains extensive budgetary controls the objective of these controls is to ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by the legislature activities of the general fund are included in the annual appropriated budget budgetary control resides at the department level the commonwealth also maintains an encumbrance accounting system as one method of maintaining budgetary control the annual budget which is developed using elements of performancebased program budgeting and zerobased budgeting includes an estimate of revenue and other resources for the ensuing fiscal year under laws existing at the time the budget is submitted and legislative measures proposed by the governor and submitted with the proposed budget as well as the governors recommendations as to appropriations that in his judgment are necessary convenient and in conformity with the fouryear investment plan prepared by the puerto rico planning board the legislature may amend the budget submitted by the governor but may not increase items that would cause a deficit without imposing additional taxes to cover such deficit once approved by the legislature the budget is referred to the governor who may decrease or eliminate any item but may not increase or insert new items in the budget the governor may also veto the budget in its entirety and return it to the legislature with his objections the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th legislature by a twothirds majority in each house may override the governors veto if a budget is not adopted prior to the end of the fiscal year as originally approved by the legislature and the governor it is automatically renewed for the ensuing fiscal year until a new budget is approved by the legislature and the governor this allows the commonwealth to continue to pay operating and other expenses until a new budget is approved assets total assets and total liabilities of the commonwealths primary government at june   amounted to  billion and  billion respectively for a net deficit of  billion compared to a  billion net deficit at the beginning of the year as restated a portion of the commonwealths net assets deficit reflects its investment in capital assets such as land buildings equipment and infrastructure less any related debt used to acquire those assets that are still outstanding the commonwealth uses these capital assets to provide services to its residents consequentially these assets are not available for future spending although the commonwealths investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities an additional portion of the commonwealths net assets deficit represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used an otherwise positive remaining balance would be used to meet the commonwealths ongoing obligations to its residents and creditors internally imposed designations of resources are not presented as restricted net assets at the end of the fiscal year the commonwealth is able to report positive balances in two categories of net assets and a deficit both for the government as a whole as well as for its separate governmental and businesstype activities the net deficit of the primary government primarily results from the commonwealths practice of issuing debt and transferring such funds to the component units so that they can carry out the construction projects the primary government retains the debt while the component units report the corresponding asset financed by such debt total assets decreased by  million during fiscal year  when compared to the prior fiscal year unrestricted and restricted cash decreased by  billion when compared to the prior year the decrease was mainly due to an increase of approximately  million in expenditures when compared to the prior year net increase of  million in the receivables was mainly due to the timing of cash collections when compared to prior year additions to capital assets retirements and depreciation expense amounted to approximately  million  million and  million respectively total liabilities increased  million during fiscal year  when compared to the prior fiscal year this fluctuation is mainly prompted by the issuance during fiscal year  of commonwealth bonds amounting to  billion and an increase in the liabilities associated with compensated absences and legal claims totaling  billion and  million respectively the latter were offset by repayments of bonds of  million compensated absences of  million and legal claims of  million  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the commonwealths net deficit increased by  billion or  from the prior years total net deficit approximately  of the commonwealths total revenue

expenses cover a range of services the largest expenses were for education public housing and welfare public safety and general government in  governmental activities expenses exceeded program revenue by  billion resulting in the use of  billion in general revenue mostly taxes and transfers on the other hand program revenue from businesstype activities in  exceeded expenses by approximately  million total governmental activities expenses increased by  million when compared with  such increase was due to the effect of increases in expenses incurred in  to fulfill the requirements of federal government grants and contributions in  which increased by  million and normal increases in costs of goods and services in addition the businesstype activities had unrestricted investments earnings of  million and transfer to the governmental activities amounting to  million governmental activities increased the commonwealths net deficit by  billion the commonwealth implemented a sales

the close of business on the business day before the inception date of the trust the public offering price would have been as shown under essential information in the prospectus the public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under essential information in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units net asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trusts portfolio securities including any accrued interest cash and other assets less all liabilities including accrued expenses by the total number of units outstanding the portfolio securities are valued at their current market value or their fair value as determined in good faith by the evaluator the aggregate bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined a on the basis of current bid or offering prices of the

stock exchange on each business day commencing with the trusts inception date of the securities effective for all sales made during the preceding hour period the interest on the securities deposited in a trust less the related estimated fees and expenses will accrue daily the amount of net interest income which accrues per unit may change as securities mature or are redeemed exchanged or sold or as the expenses of a trust change or the number of outstanding units of a trust changes although payment is normally made three business days following the order for purchase payments may be made prior thereto a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  if a unitholder desires to have certificates representing units purchased such certificates will be delivered as soon as possible following his written request therefor accrued interest accrued interest consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on securities generally is paid monthly or semiannually although a trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date the public offering price of units of a trust will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to the public the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st include only accrued interest arising after the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date the second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust the trustee is obligated to provide its own funds at times in order to advanced interest distributions the trustee will recover these advancements when such interest is received interest account balances are established to limit the extent to which it may be necessary for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions the interest account balances are also structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances because of the varying interest payment dates of securities accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders therefore there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to the value of the units if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds held in the interest account for distributions to unitholders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unitholders the trustee benefits thereby comparison of public offering price and redemption price while the net asset value of units during the initial offering period will generally be determined on the basis of the current offering prices of the securities in a trust after the initial offering period the net asset value of units will generally be determined on the basis of the current bid prices of the securities as of the close of business on the business day before the trusts inception date the public offering price per unit exceeded the redemption price at which units could have been redeemed by the amount of the sales fee the bid prices for on securities similar to those in the trust are lower than the offering prices thereof for this reason among others including fluctuations in the market prices of the securities and the fact that the public offering price includes a sales fee the amount realized by a unitholder upon any redemption of units may be less than the price paid for such units public distribution of units the sponsor intends to qualify the units for sale in a number of states units will be sold through dealers who are members of the financial industry regulatory authority inc and through others sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis the sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time we may provide at our own expense and out of our own profits additional compensation and benefits to brokerdealers who sell shares of units of this trust and our other products this compensation is intended to result in additional sales of our products andor compensate brokerdealers and financial advisors for past sales we may make these payments for marketing promotional or related expenses including but not limited to expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors advertising sponsorship of events or seminars obtaining shelf  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd space in brokerdealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the our products these arrangements will not change the price you pay for your units the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units profits of sponsor the sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents in addition the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the cost of such securities to a trust which is based on the offering side evaluation of the securities the sponsor may also realize profits or losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member an underwriter or underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or competitive bid basis as principal with the motive of marketing such securities to investors at a profit the sponsor may realize additional profits or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust market for units after the initial offering period while not obligated to do so the sponsor may subject to change at any time maintain a market for units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said units at the net asset value determined by the evaluator based on the aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in the trust together with any accrued interest to the expected dates of settlement to the extent that a market is maintained during the initial offering period the prices at which units will be repurchased will be based upon the aggregate offering side evaluation of the securities in the trust the aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in each trust are expected to be less than the related aggregate offering prices which is generally the evaluation method used during the initial public offering period accordingly unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the sponsor if the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons redemption a unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and in the case of units evidenced by a certificate by tendering such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee unitholders must sign the request and such certificate or transfer instrument

undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished the price received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of redemption certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption requests under regulations issued by the internal revenue service the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholders tax identification number in the manner required by such regulations any amount so withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a tax return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified tax identification number in order to avoid this possible backup withholding in the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number one must be provided at the time redemption is requested any amounts paid on redemption representing interest shall be withdrawn from the interest account of a trust to the extent that funds are available for such purpose all other amounts paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the principal account for a trust the trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds available for the redemption of units

to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net short term capital loss if any that it distributes to unitholders the trusts intend to distribute to its unitholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain if your trust retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax unless generally your trust distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  of the calendar year and  any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years to prevent application of the excise tax your trust

undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who if subject to federal income tax on longterm capital gains i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during january of the following calendar year these distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th if your trust failed to qualify as a regulated

current return as of the close of business on the business day before the trusts inception date the estimated longterm return and the estimated current return if applicable for each trust were as set forth in the essential information for each trust in the prospectus estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trustee the sponsor and the evaluator and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of the securities while the public offering price will vary with changes in the offering price of the underlying securities and accrued interest therefore there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements or average life of all of the securities in a trust and  takes into account the expenses and sales fee associated with each trust unit since the market values and estimated retirements of the securities and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price

of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the issue credit rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a financial obligation inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor issue credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the obligors or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any credit rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances issue credit ratings can be either long term or short term shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered shortterm in the relevant market in the us for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper short term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on longterm obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations  likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation  nature of and provisions of the obligation  protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the issue rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th

exposures to adverse conditions bban obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ban obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than

capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cccan obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity

are reviewed annually based on a new years financial statements but may be reviewed on an interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuers credit quality prthe letters pr indicate that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the
