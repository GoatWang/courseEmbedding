certificate business to symantec in  verisign had more than  million certificates in operation for everything from military to financial services and retail applications making it the largest ca in the world in  verisign acquired network solutions which operated the com net and org tlds under agreements with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann and the united states

edu and jobs toplevel domains for their respective registry operators which are nonprofit organizations in this role verisign maintains the zone files for these particular domains and host the domains

hierarchical domain name system that supports all internet communication verisign also generates the globally recognized root zone file and is also responsible for processing changes to that file once they are ordered by icann and approved by the us department of commerce changes to the root zone were originally distributed via the a root server but now they are distributed to all thirteen servers

icann was established and the new system of competitive registrars was implemented as a result of these new policies network solutions divided itself into two divisions the nsi registry division was established to manage the authoritative registries that the company would still operate and was separated from the customerfacing registrar business that would have to compete with other registrars the divisions were even geographically split with the nsi registry moving from the corporate headquarters in herndon virginia to nearby dulles virginia in  verisign purchased network solutions taking

the dns constellation resolution sites are located mostly at major internet peering facilities one such facility is at the equinix ashburn datacenter in ashburn virginia one of the worlds largest datacenters and internet transit hubs controversiesedit  code signing certificate mistakeedit in january  verisign mistakenly issued two class  code signing certificates to an individual claiming to be an employee of microsoft the mistake was not discovered and the certificates were not revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit because verisign codesigning certificates do not specify a certificate revocation list distribution point there was no way for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked placing microsofts customers at riskcitation needed microsoft had to later release a special security patch in order to revoke the certificates and mark them as being fraudulent  domain transfer law suitedit in  verisign was sued for domain slamming – transferring domains from other registrars to themselves by making the registrants believe they were merely renewing their domain name although they were found not to have broken the law they were barred from suggesting that a domain was about to expire or claim that a transfer was actually a renewal  site finder legal caseedit in september  verisign introduced a service called site finder which redirected web browsers to a search service when users attempted to go to nonexistent com or net domain names icann asserted that verisign had overstepped the terms of its contract with the us department of commerce which in essence grants verisign the right to operate the dns for com and net and verisign shut down the service subsequently verisign filed a lawsuit against icann in february  seeking to gain clarity over what services it could offer in the context of its contract with icann the claim was moved from federal to california state court in august  in late  verisign and icann announced a proposed settlement which defined a process for the introduction of new registry services in the com registry the documents concerning these settlements are available at icannorg the icann comments mailing list archive documents some of the criticisms that have been raised regarding the settlement additionally verisign was involved in the sexcom matter decided by the ninth circuit  gives up org domainedit in keeping with icann’s charter to introduce competition to the domain name marketplace verisign agreed to give up its operation of org toplevel domain in  in exchange for a continuation of its contract to operate com which at the time had more than  million registered addresses  retains net domainedit in mid the existing contract for the operation of net expired and five companies including verisign bid for management of it verisigns bid was backed by numerous it and telecom heavyweights including microsoft ibm sun microsystems mci and others which all asserted that verisign

announced that verisign had been approved to operate net until  more information on the net bidding process is available at icann on july   icann announced that verisigns approval to operate net was extended another six years until   data breach and disclosure controversyedit in february  verisign revealed that their network security had been repeatedly breached in  verisign stated that the breach did not impact the domain name system dns that they maintain but would not provide details about the loss of data verisign was widely criticized for not disclosing the breach earlier and apparently attempting to hide the news in an october  sec filing because of the lack of details provided by verisign it was not clear whether the breach impacted the certificate signing business acquired by symantec in late  according to oliver lavery the director of security and research for ncircle can we trust any site using verisign ssl certificates without more clarity the logical answer is no”  web site domain seizuresedit on november   the us immigration and customs enforcement us ice issued seizure orders against  web sites with com internet addresses that were reported to be

time limited noncompete agreement the new company served as a certificate authority ca and its initial mission was providing trust for the internet and electronic commerce through our digital authentication services and products prior to selling its certificate business to symantec in  verisign had more than  million certificates in operation for everything from military to financial services and retail applications making it the largest ca in the world in  verisign acquired network solutions which operated the com net and org tlds under agreements with the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann and the united states department of commerce those core registry functions formed the basis for verisign’s naming division which is now the company’s largest and most significant business unit in  verisign was charged with violation of the securities exchange act verisign divested the network solutions retail domain name registrar business in  retaining the domain name registry wholesale function as its core internet addressing business for the year ended december   verisign reported revenue of  million up  from  million in  verisign operates two businesses naming services which encompasses the operation of toplevel domains and critical internet infrastructure and network intelligence and availability nia services which encompasses ddos mitigation managed dns and threat intelligence verisigns share price tumbled in early  hastened by the us governments announcement that it would relinquish oversight of the internets domainnaming system to a nongovernment entity ultimately the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers chose to continue verisigns role as the root zone maintainer and the two entered into a new contract in  authentication saleedit security token produced by verisign on august   symantec completed its approximately  billion acquisition of verisigns authentication business including the secure sockets

important toplevel domains com and net it is also the contracted registry operator for the name and gov toplevel domains as well as the country code toplevel domains cc cocos islands and tv tuvalu in addition verisign is the primary technical subcontractor for the edu and jobs toplevel domains for their respective registry operators which are nonprofit organizations in this role verisign maintains the zone files for these particular domains and host the domains from their domain servers registry operators are the wholesalers of internet domain names while domain name registrars act as the “retailers” working directly with consumers to register a domain name address verisign also operates two of the internet’s thirteen root servers which are identified by the letters am verisign operates the “a” and “j” root servers the root servers form the top of the hierarchical domain name system that supports all internet communication verisign also generates the globally recognized root zone file and is also responsible for processing changes to that file once they are ordered by icann and approved by the us department of commerce changes to the root zone were originally distributed via the a root server but now they are distributed to all thirteen servers via a separate distribution system which verisign maintains verisign is the only one of the  root server operators to operate more than one of the thirteen root nameservers the a and j root servers are anycasted” and are no longer operated from any of the companys own datacenters as a means to increase redundancy and availability and mitigate the threat of a single point of failure in  the department of commerce ended its role in managing the internets dns and transferred full control to icann while this initially negatively impacted verisigns stock icann eventually chose to contract with verisign to continue its role as the root zone maintainer verisigns naming services division dates back to  when network solutions was awarded a contract by the national science foundation to manage and operate the civilian side of the internets domain name registrations network solutions was the sole registrar for all of the internets non governmental generic toplevel domains until  when icann was established and the new system of competitive registrars was implemented as a result of these new policies network solutions divided itself into two divisions the nsi registry division was established to manage the authoritative registries that the company would still operate and was separated from the customerfacing registrar business that would have to compete with other registrars the divisions were even geographically split with the nsi registry moving from the corporate headquarters in herndon virginia to nearby dulles virginia in  verisign purchased network solutions taking over its role in the internet dns the nsi registry division eventually became verisigns naming services division

mountain view california to the headquarters of the naming division in sterling virginia originally nsi registrys headquarters verisign began shopping that year for a new permanent home shortly after moving they signed a lease for  bluemont way in reston the former sallie mae headquarters in  and decided to purchase the building in september  they have since terminated their lease of their current space in two buildings at lakesideloudoun technology center the company completed its move at the end of november  the new headquarters is located in the reston town center development which has become a major commercial and business hub for the region in addition to its reston headquarters verisign owns three data center properties one at  dresden street in dulles virginia not far from its corporate headquarters within the large broad run technology park one at  boulden circle in new castle delaware and a third in fribourg switzerland their three data centers are mirrored so that a disaster at one data center has a minimal impact on operations verisign also leases an office suite in downtown washington dc on k street where its government relations office is located it also has leased server space in numerous internet data centers around the world where the dns constellation resolution sites are located mostly at major internet peering facilities one such facility is at the equinix ashburn datacenter in ashburn virginia one of the worlds largest datacenters and internet transit hubs controversiesedit  code signing certificate mistakeedit in january  verisign mistakenly issued two class  code signing certificates to an individual claiming to be an employee of microsoft the mistake was not discovered and the certificates were not revoked until two weeks later during a routine audit because verisign codesigning certificates do not specify a certificate revocation list distribution point there was no way for them to be automatically detected as having been revoked placing microsofts customers at riskcitation needed microsoft had to later release a special security patch in order to revoke the certificates and mark them as being fraudulent  domain transfer law suitedit in  verisign was sued for domain slamming – transferring domains from other registrars to themselves by making the registrants believe they were merely renewing their domain name although they were found not to have broken the law they were barred from suggesting that a domain was about to expire or claim that a transfer was actually a renewal  site finder legal caseedit in september  verisign introduced a service called site finder which redirected web browsers to a search service when users attempted to go to nonexistent com or net domain names icann asserted that verisign had overstepped the terms of its contract with the us department of commerce which in essence grants verisign the right to operate the dns for com and net and verisign shut down the service subsequently verisign filed a lawsuit against icann in february  seeking to gain clarity over what services it could offer in the context of its contract with icann the claim was moved from federal to california state court in august  in late  verisign and icann announced a proposed settlement which defined a process for the introduction of new registry services in the com registry the documents concerning these settlements are available at icannorg the icann comments mailing list archive documents some of the criticisms that have been raised regarding the settlement additionally verisign was involved in the sexcom matter decided by the ninth circuit  gives up org domainedit in keeping with icann’s charter to introduce competition to the domain name marketplace verisign agreed to give up its operation of org toplevel domain in  in exchange for a continuation of its contract to operate com which at the time had more than  million registered addresses  retains net domainedit in mid the existing contract for the operation of net expired and five companies including verisign bid for management of it verisigns bid was backed by numerous it and telecom heavyweights including microsoft ibm sun microsystems mci and others which all asserted that verisign had a perfect record operating net they proposed verisign continue to manage the net dns due to its critical importance as the domain underlying numerous backbone network services on june   icann announced that verisign had been approved to operate net until  more information on the net bidding process is available at icann on july   icann announced that verisigns approval to operate net was extended another six years until   data breach and disclosure controversyedit in february  verisign revealed that their network security had been repeatedly breached in  verisign stated that the breach did not impact the domain name system dns that they maintain but would not provide details about the loss of data verisign was widely criticized for not disclosing the breach earlier and apparently attempting to hide the news in an october  sec filing because of the lack of details provided by verisign it was not clear whether the breach impacted the certificate signing business acquired by symantec in late  according to oliver lavery the director of security and research for ncircle can we trust any site using verisign ssl certificates without more clarity the logical answer is no”  web site domain seizuresedit on november   the us immigration and customs enforcement us ice issued seizure orders against  web sites with com internet addresses that were reported to be involved in the illegal sale and distribution of counterfeit goods as registry operator for com verisign performed the required takedowns of the  sites under order from law enforcement informationweek reported that verisign will say only that it received sealed court orders directing certain actions to be taken with respect to specific domain names the removal of the  websites was cited as an impetus for the launch of the dotpp project in order to create a decentralized dns service without centralized registry operators following the disappearance of wikileaks during the following week and its forced move to wikileaksch a swiss domain the electronic frontier foundation warned of the dangers of having key pieces of internet

cherine chalaby director icann and chair new gtld program committee exhibit  new gtld security and stability considerations verisign labs technical report  version  abstract the introduction of multitudes of new generic top level domains gtlds into the dns the internets de facto name mapping system will have farreaching effects any party concerned with the issues of privacy trust confidence or the overall security of the dns after the addition of new gtlds either from the consumer or the operator perspective is implicitly depending on the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers icann and the broader dns community to appropriately address these issues before delegating any new gtlds the risk of a misstep during the process of introducing new gtlds to the global dns could have farreaching and longlasting residual implications many of the issues cataloged in this report focus on work that is currently not done and should be completed before any new gtlds can be deployed in a safe and secure manner to both illustrate the concerns that exist and to clearly identify the rationale behind these concerns the general areas of focus in this report are root server system implications operational readiness for gtld registries and risks of name collisions on the internet all of which will potentially have a considerable impact on the security and consumption of new gtlds as well as on the broader existing dns ecosystem i i ntroduction the ecosystem surrounding the domain name system dns  has been evolving since the late s during this time it has become a multistakeholder system that is rich with technical political and operational policy complexity many understand the basic structure of the global name space of dns is a simple tree structure with a single root “zone” delegating to top level domains tlds and those tlds delegating to second level domains slds etc however the rich complexities of dns structure and interactions are not always deeply considered especially in the face of those who wish to change them a great deal of prior work has outlined much of the nuanced but extensive complexities of dns ecosystem issues like transitive trust   complexities that arise from adding cryptography to the dns via the dns security extensions dnssec   the  rs of dns registry registrar and registrant relationships  the need to quantify dns and dnssecs operational statuses  and many more the list of these sorts of systemic complexities and dependencies betrays the relative caution that stewards of the dns generally exercise when evolving the dns however without proper precautions processes and safeguards being in place and fully specified the advent of a multitude of new generic top level domains gtlds to the dns root zone may give rise to security and stability issues though the process of deciding whether to add new gtlds and the steps to outline how to add them has been ongoing for many years  is the target year for the newest round and largest addition of new gtlds to go live in preparation many concerns and prerequisites have been outlined however at the precipice of these new additions many details processes questions and concerns remain unaddressed in this report we outline many of the missing elements and some of the possible ramifications that could result from deploying new gtlds and the effects that could be felt throughout the internet if proper caution is not exercised having been commissioned by the senior management at verisign inc the goal of this report is to catalog many of the issues verisign is currently facing related to new gtlds and the surrounding processes specifically from the perspective of a large registry and internet infrastructure operator additionally the aim is to raise the awareness of the various elements and subtleties of the rollout process as well as the seriousness of issues that could prove to have significant consequences and perhaps even destabilize global operations of the dns if not given due consideration the remainder of the work is organized as follows we first motivate many of our concerns with real world examples of how unexpected complexities in the dns ecosystem have already led to major operational challenges that were only visible after initial deployment and which suggest changes be made slowly and cautiously in section ii then section iii discusses the nonobvious details of the operations of the dns root zone and how its holistic status is really the result of a federated effort and provides discussion of the importance of measuring its status next section iv discusses the complexities that are involved in adding new gtlds to the root zone with these baselines section v introduces the complexities that arise from the dns ecosystems “interdisciplinary” nature lastly we conclude in section vi ii s ystemic  c omplexities the dns is a deceptively complicated system its namespace is a hierarchical tree structure its data is often organized in simple zone files its zones are served by simple name servers and its clients recursively traverse the namespace tree etc however the operational realities and complexities of todays internet give rise to many nonobvious security and stability issues to illustrate the nuanced yet critical issues that can arise from seemingly straightforward changes we look at two failure modes that were entirely surprising and arguably unforeseeable before they occurred i “rollover and die” and ii the “poisoning” of recursive resolvers through dns censorship in the early days of dnssec validation in  an odd burst in traffic began to appear at various dnssec authoritative name servers increasing numbers of observations indicated that periodically name servers would come under extreme load for dnskey queries from validating resolvers subsequent investigations identified what has come to be known as the “rollover and die” problem  in this case when validating resolvers found unverifiable dnskeys they began iterating over the dnssec chain of trust all the way up to the dns root until the chain was mended as a result even simple dnskey rollovers resulted in extremely large traffic volumes all the way up the delegation chain this unintended behavior resulted in a way for descendant zones or arbitrary depth in the dns hierarchy to prompt all validators to direct excessive query loads to all ancestors while this behavior has been corrected in validating resolvers it serves as a warning that the relationship between what data is being served and what query behavior it may elicit is not always obvious another example of unintended interactions was observed in conjunction with internet censorship for some time it has been known that different political climates result in dns censorship  one unexpected consequence of this increasingly common behavior is that it can result in a denial of service dos vector to name servers     what has been observed is that if a dnssec validating resolver is presented with a nonvalidatable response from a name server it will try other name servers for the same zone and it will blacklist that name server considering it invalid this can happen if for example a censoring country has middleboxes rewriting responses to queries from censored domains and serving those to the querying resolvers the rationale behind the resolvers behavior blacklisting the name servers is to protect the dnssec cache from a source that seems to be sending invalid data however in the event that the entire set of name servers appear to be transmitting unverifiable such as when censorship is being employed resolvers may no longer be able to reach any information served by these authorities we use these two cases as just two illustrations of how unforeseen interactions must be expected when making changes to dns and that the types of complex interactions may often be unknowable  a priori iii t he  r oot  s erver  s ystem the ability of the root server system to introduce the multitudes of new gtlds rather than the very few that occasionally are added today deal with the increased frequency of change and identify any issues before they negatively impact the operation of the global internet is paramount the following two subsections section iiia  system monitoring and reporting  and section iiib  automated tld additions to the root  catalog areas where action needs to be taken before any new gtld delegations occur in order to minimize risk to the overall internet ecosystem as delegation of names in the root has far broader implications than simply updating the root zone file a system monitoring and reporting practically since the beginning of the domain name system dns  in the early s the root servers have been operated by different organizations today twelve organizations operate the thirteen root server ipv addresses and only nine root servers have ipv addresses present in the root zone because of techniques enabled by ip anycasting there are many more than   verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  physical servers but by convention all instances of a given root server ip address run by the same operator are still referred to collectively as a “root server” each operator is responsible for only its own root server and has complete autonomy in the design of its infrastructure the type of hardware and software used and the operating and monitoring procedures the root operators are independent organizations there is no umbrella organization to which they all belong they have established communications channels for loose coordination and meet regularly in person all operators share one important unifying principle to publish the root zone administered by the internet assigned numbers authority iana function this multioperator arrangement makes administration of the root zone unusual compared to other critical dns zones but the dedication and technical expertise of the root operators have allowed the current administrative model to succeed there is one area where improvement is necessary however unified monitoring and reporting of the root server system to allow visibility into the system as a whole each operator monitors its own root server and some operators report the status and performance of their services publicly but this monitoring applies to individual root servers not to the entire root server system there is no mechanism currently in place to allow a detailed view of the entire system short of the annual “day in the life” ditl  data collection which covers only a short time period and has been implemented for research purposes not to provide overall monitoring and an operational view of system health such a view needs the consent of the operators only individual operators have access to detailed information about their respective services and a highresolution picture of the systems performance can only be obtained by combining this detailed perserver data as an example while individual operators know how much traffic their individual servers receive without aggregation of this data from all the individual operators and their servers it is difficult to determine how much traffic the entire root server system receives since at least  there has been lengthy discussion within the icann community about the ability of the root to scale to accommodate new gtlds this discussion ultimately led to a request by the icann board in late   affirming the need observed by the security and stability advisory committee ssac for “actual measurement monitoring and datasharing capability of root zone performance”  separately the root server system advisory committee rssac had earlier agreed in late   on the need to establish standard metrics to be collected and reported by all operators so that the entire root server systems performance could be monitored to establish a baseline of behavior and as a result of that baseline any possible negative effect from the added tlds identified there has been significant progress on establishing coordinated monitoring and measurement of the root but there is work yet to be done as of this writing rssac is finalizing the specific metrics that each root operator will collect and some operators are already collecting data based on the preliminary data collection specification under review a separate discussion about where the operators will send their respective data for analysis once collected is also in progress within rssac the current inability to view the root server systems performance as a whole presents a risk when combined with the impending delegation of the multitude of new gtlds there is not yet a holistic view of the systems performance that would enable the technical community to determine the impact of added tlds the progress to date on unified measurement is admirable and encouraging and a successful outcome is in sight and closer than ever before but it is vital to the security and stability of the root server system that metrics collection from all operators is in place before delegation of new gtlds begins it is also critical that the operators reach consensus on a mechanism for all collected measurement data to be shared with the community for analysis it is important to note that harmonized monitoring and reporting must start sufficiently ahead of when the first new gtlds are delegated to establish a baseline for the current normal performance of the system without a baseline determining whether or not future changes represent a negative trend becomes very difficult only with harmonized metrics collection in place and an understanding of the current systems normal performance parameters can the rapid expansion of this critical operational system be considered safe b automated tld additions to the root three organizations cooperate to produce the root zoneicann as the iana functions operator processes requests for changes to the zone usually these changes come from existing tld operators but requests for delegation of new gtlds will come from elsewhere within icann icann communicates change requests to us department of commerces docs national  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  telecommunications and information administration ntia for authorization and verisign the root zone maintainer for implementation verisign maintains the database of record for the root zone from which the zone file is generated until recently the process to update the root zone was largely manual the three organizations communicated changes using humanreadable forms via cryptographically signed email in july  icann and verisign each deployed new systems that largely automated the change process for existing tlds at icann tld operators can submit changes via a web interface rather than filling out an email template icanns system communicates change requests using predictable semantics to verisigns system using the extensible provisioning protocol epp the same protocol used between many tld registrars and registries and doc ntia personnel authorize changes via a web interface rather than a signed email not every aspect of the system is automated however which was an intentional design decision at verisign for example each pending change and a corresponding report showing the results of various validation tests relating to the change is approved by a dns expert engineer before it is implemented in the root zone the process keeps the best part of the manual aspect  inspection by a human  while removing the risk involved with interpreting templates and transcribing changes from email to database not every aspect of tld administration ultimately planned for automation is automated at this point however icanns root zone management system only processes changes for existing tlds the process of creating tlds follows a different process than tld changes and has historically used a different system since icanns initial automation development effort focused on the system that processes changes for existing tlds icanns automated system did not initially use the epp interface with verisigns system to add a tld instead the add tld process uses the legacy cryptographically signed email templates among icann verisign and doc after addition of a new tld is authorized by doc verisign engineers enter the new tld parameters from the email template into a tool that communicates via epp to verisigns automation system which has always supported the add tld function this process is undesirable because it still requires an engineer to transcribe requests and also results in a longer time period when the data in icanns and verisigns systems is not synchronized regardless of the number of safeguards in place and the care taken a manual transcription will always introduce more risk than a transaction that does not require human involvement verisign and icann have both acknowledged the importance of fully automating the add tld process since shortly after the initial automation system was deployed in july  we have also agreed on the necessity of this automation before delegation of new gtlds begins verisign believes that a significant increase in the frequency of new gtlds being created without the data integrity and validation benefits offered by automation represents a security and stability risk fortunately a development effort at icann to complete this automation is underway and has reached the stage of integration testing with verisigns systems there has been good progress but also some initial uncertainty over the scope and completion date of the testing this uncertainty combined with uncertainty over when the first new gtlds will be delegated has led to concern that the add tld automation effort might not be tested deployed and had time to run in place with normal root zone churn before new gtlds become ready for delegation we are confident this effort will be successful and the add tld process will be fully automated but for data integrity reasons we believe it is important that the effort be finished in sufficient time before new gtld delegation begins figure  illustrates the growth of the number and type of objects in the root zone itself over time because each new tld requires multiple associated objects to implement the delegation the overall root zone size has a multiplicative relationship relative to the number of new gtlds in other words for every new tld multiple records must be added to the zone one can see the growth of new tlds country code and generic over time has been fairly modest while associated resource records have been added at varying increasing frequencies the combinatorial effects of introducing dnssec    ipv aaaa resource records  internationalized domain names idns  and new gtlds into the root zone all within a relatively short time frame are still not well understood particularly aspects relating to the impact on the broader dns ecosystem as well as the impact on external dependent systems  as discussed in later sections iv o perational  r eadiness   for   g tld r egistries rolling out the multitudes of new gtlds and implicitly adding the associated levels of churn into the relatively stagnant dns root zone will require a lot of process and dependencies the smaller scale evolution that the root has traditionally experienced likely has not illuminated the processrelated complexities and problems that in our considered opinion will almost certainly abound with larger scale changes without a well constructed and well reasoned process model and at the scale of changes foreseen with the addition of the unprecedented rate of the new gtlds being added the entire dns hierarchy faces the potential for issues at or near the root of the dns tree and the fallout from such a change could affect all delegations  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  from our perspective as a largescale registry operator it is apparent that the new gtld timelines provide little accommodation for the operator aspects of the process that is given the information to date it seems as though icann has taken a very icanncentric role in establishing these timeliness and gave little consideration to the fact that registry operators would need to ingest requirements implement specifications pilot internally prepare to accommodate test cases consider the security implications and change management functions required etc it actually appears as though there is little to no time allotted for operators to adequately prepare and the lack of stable fundamental specifications and test plans within days of publicly stated testing times illustrates a clear disconnect between aspirational timelines with the new gtld program and operational realities with which various stakeholders are constrained the following subsections capture some areas where timelines sequence and dependencies have been and continue to be problematic for verisign in this area the trademark clearing house tmch will determine which registrants are entitled to register within gtlds without a trademark infringement predelegation testing pdt will ensure that new gtlds are ready to go online emergency back end registry operator ebero  escrow  zone file access zfa all ensure the “who” “what” and “how” of handling cases where a gtld suffers a failure and goes offline sla monitoring tracks the security and status of new gtlds whois provides the access to registrant information and it remains unclear whether icanns government advisory council gac determines if icann is even allowed to deploy any given gtld a trademark clearinghouse tmch the trademark clearing house tmch is an important rights protection mechanism for the introduction of new gtld registries the tmch is comprised of two primary functions  a repository of marks submitted by trademark holders the provider of this service receives and validates the marks icann selected deloitte enterprise risk services as the trademark validation provider for the tmch on february   icann announced that this system would be available on march    a centralized database of validated marks this database includes provisioning relevant data to new gtld registries and registrars that are required for sunrise  and trademark claims services as part of new gtld launches this database is critical in order to avoid conflicts that may arise when multiple parties claim to have jurisdiction over the same gtld identifier icann is working with ibm and has announced that these systems are anticipated to be operational later in  new gtld registries cannot begin sunrise when there is no tmch thereby presenting a number of concerns  as late as q  the proposed date for the tmch system to be live was january  the february th notice does not define the date that registries and registrars can expect the systems to be available including both the centralized database and the repository of marks  the specifications for registries and registrars have not been finalized resulting in a lack of information for these organizations to prepare their systems the initial draft specifications version  that define the mapping for marks and signed mark data were posted by icann only on february   as expected with any initial draft this has generated discussion and many recommended modifications therefore the current internet draft does not represent a stable specification that can be built upon  the absence of any clear commitment for when the specifications and the tmch will be available for integration testing and when it will be live precludes organizations from proceeding with planning scheduling development and normal business planning and associated communications with customers further a compressed testing time frame will jeopardize the stability and scalability of the tmch system as icann will not have an opportunity to validate the system against real world issues like ddos attacks and inconsistent global network connectivity  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  figure  trends in dns root zone growth b predelegation testing pdt predelegation testing is required prior to the introduction of all new gtlds icann issued an rfp to solicit for testing providers in november  and selected stiftelsen för internetinfrastruktur se registry in december icann is currently developing a pilot for selected registries to participate in pilot testing during march  through april  there are a number of outstanding issues related to the pdt as were outlined in detail by the registry stakeholder group rysg as of late these issues include but are not limited to insufficient documentation or specifications from icann and the pdt provider related to the following • test plan documentation • load capacity testing information • reachability documentation • tcp and dnssec capabilities • testing against existing infrastructure • idn table testing • trademark clearinghouse c emergency back end registry operator ebero icann identified five critical functions required of all new gtld registry operators so that should a registry fail an emergency back end registry operator ebero provider would assume these functions icanns original plan was to select ebero providers in june  with simulations and drills in january and february  and providers prepared to be live in march while icann issued an rfi in july  and developed a short list in december  there are currently no signedtested ebero providers to our knowledge with no ebero providers the continuity risk of any registry failure is significantly increased the original plan allotted ebero providers with six months from selection to preparation for testing therefore it is reasonable to conclude that from the date ebero providers are selected that icann should expect that they will require six months to prepare for testing with another two months of testing prior to being prepared for a registry failure should any registries launch prior to ebero provider readiness in the event of a registry failure or outage the continuity of operations risk could be measured in days weeks or even months rather than the hours specified in the ebero service level requirements  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  d escrow all gtld registry operators are required to enter into an escrow agreement and make incremental and full deposits of registry data on a prescribed schedule the availability of escrow is an essential component for emergency back end registry operators ebero in the event of a registry failure in order to provide the critical functions and requirements defined in the applicant guidebook noting that escrow is one of these critical functions the application guidebook references draft escrow specifications expressly there are currently two draft specifications xml and csv that are being coordinated to merge into a single specification although the specifications are not stable references at this time the lack of an approved stable final specification will require registry operators to either select a draft specification for implementation or will result in delaying the launch of any gtlds until a final specification is defined and implemented by the registry operators should various registries select from available or future draft specifications an ebero providers timely and accurate data recovery during an emergency situation is significantly an increased risk an observation that should certainly be considered as critical as new gtld operations are being brought online e zone file access new gtld registries are required to provide thirdparty access to zone file data registry operators are required to enter into an agreement that will be standardized facilitated and administered by a centralized zone data access czda provider the community has not been informed of any progress on soliciting for a czda provider or of any progress on creation of the standardized agreement or process for registry operators to provide users with access to zone file data registry operators will not be able to comply with contractual requirements to provide zone file data in the manner specified and required in the gtld applicant guidebook therefore third parties will not have access to zone file data for new gtlds additionally ebero providers will not have access to zone file data because icann has not specified ebero providers nor the manner with which providers once designated will access zone files f sla monitoring monitoring of registry performance specifications for new gtlds relies on the implementation of external probes operated by icann however these systems methodologies and processes have not yet been defined without monitoring in place icann will have no ability to detect understand if or evaluate and identify if a registry encroaches on any emergency thresholds for critical functions nor will they have visibility into performance against specific service levels icann has had the right to perform similar monitoring under the cross network nameserver performance cnnp specifications in existing gtlds since the first new gtlds were introduced more than a decade ago yet icann has never established this monitoring and measurement capability icann has engaged in significant discussions on the continuity of operations instrument yet has not established that the operational mechanisms themselves are ready for the launch of new gtlds g whois change requirements new standards and or requirements may need to be implemented for models such as restful interfaces to whois even though specifications are still unstable h government advisory council gac advice the requirement for gac advice delegations with possible separate eu advice could delay timelines andor impact applications or worse it is unclear if it would be possible that a tld could launch then receive gac advice  would icann withdraw the delegation or might some countries begin to block certain tlds causing fragmentation of the internet the uncertainty in this area is of considerable concern to applicants operators and consumers alike v r isks   of  n ame  c ollisions   on the  i nternet since the inception of the internet dns it has been known that interactive complexities can result in large scale security and stability issues as well as hard to diagnose corner cases where consumer expectations are unaddressed or users are provided an unsafe or otherwise less than desirable experience express interdisciplinary studies are paramount to proactive mitigation of  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  issues with which the dns interacts in this section we catalog several such issues provide general discussion related to usability of new gtlds as well as consider the current status of some requests that have been made of icann to conduct broader studies in this area a internal names certificates on march th  the icann security and stability advisory committee ssac published an advisory titled ssac advisory on internal name certificates sac  the advisory identified a certificate authority ca practice that if widely exploited “could pose a significant risk to the privacy and integrity of secure internet communications” as conveyed from icann to the “new gtld communications” email distribution list on march   just after the advisory was made public it is believed that this ca practice could impact the new gtld program appendix a of the advisory provides a timeline that suggests the issue was brought to the attention of icann via the ssac midnovember  at the annual ssac workshop and upon recognizing the seriousness of this issue the ssac formed a work party to develop advice for icann and the community that effort led to discussions with the icann security team the certification authoritybrowser cab forum and working party representatives from ssac the product of which is reflected in the advisory the following  findings were captured in  and provide an overview of the internal names certificates issue that has given reason for security and stability concerns particularly when intersecting the implications with the delegation and operation of new gtlds finding  the ssl observatory data shows that at least  cas have issued internal name certificates finding  the exact number of internal name certificates that end in an applied for new gtld cannot be known unless cas voluntarily disclose the list finding  enterprises use internal name certificates for a variety of reasons finding  the practice for issuing internal name certificates allows a person not related to an applied for tld to obtain a certificate for the tld with little or no validation and launch a maninthemiddle attack more effectively finding  the ca  browser cab forum is aware of this issue and requests its members to stop this practice by october  the vulnerability window to new gtlds is at least  years the empirical data provided in the report was from  datasets and as indicated in the report and discussed in finding  only represents a lower bound observation of internal name certificates that is given that these certificates are presumably allocated for internalonly use ie not visible on internetfacing servers it is reasonable to assume that the number of issued certificates is much larger and without a complete corpus across all certification authorities it would be impossible to ascertain the potential impact with the delegation of any new gtld the recommendations section of  follows note numbered bullets inserted and original footnote pointers removed recommendation the icann security team should immediately develop and execute a risk mitigation plan the mitigation plan should include at least  outreach to the cab forum and cas requesting that they treat applied for new gtlds as if they were delegated tlds as soon as possible as well as discussing the broader implications and mitigation steps in doing so icann should seek to create trust relationships between icann and cab forum and cas because of the potential for collateral harm to users if disclosure is made public before mitigation is effected the ssac believes it is important to conduct correspondence confidentially  a disclosure policy as informed by industry best practices for vulnerability disclosure eg cert  cc vulnerability disclosure such a policy should take into consideration that once the disclosure is public it is trivial to exploit the vulnerability  a communication plan on informing affected parties as determined by the disclosure policy  a contingency plan to be executed if the vulnerability is leaked to the public prematurely as well as a proactive vulnerability disclosure plan  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  regarding the first recommendation as a result of the ssac efforts and subsequent dialog between the icann security team and the cab forum efforts to remedy at least some of this vulnerability have led to some marked improvements in minimizing the potential exposure window of internal name certificates specifically as conveyed in the detailed findings information in  the initial vulnerability window for new gtlds may have persisted for three years or more via the product of new ”baseline requirements for the issuance and management of publicly trusted certificates” from the cab forum that went into effect july   and is as follows as of the effective date  july  of these requirements prior to the issuance of a certificate with a subjectalternativename extension or subject commonname field containing a reserved ip address or internal server name the ca shall notify the applicant that the use of such certificates has been deprecated by the ca  browser forum and that the practice will be eliminated by october  also as of the effective date  july  the ca shall not issue a certificate with an expiry date later than  november  with a subjectalternativename extension or subject commonname field containing a reserved ip address or internal server name effective  october  cas shall revoke all unexpired certificates whose subjectalternativename extension or subject commonname field contains a reserved ip address or internal server name as highlighted in  while that was indeed welcome news it was problematic because icann plans to delegate new tlds in  introducing vulnerability for potential new gtlds until october  further dialog with the cab forum led to cab forum advanced ballot  on new gtlds the ballot called for cas to stop issuing certificates that end in an appliedforgtld string within  days of icann signing the contract with the registry operator and to revoke any existing certificates within  days of icann signing the contract with the registry operator the full text of the ballot is included as appendix b of  on february   the cab forum passed ballot  wildcard certificates and new gtlds march   the ssac finalized its advisory based on the mitigations and additional input provided by the certificate authority security council and published  shortly thereafter this effort shortened the exposure window considerably but residual vulnerabilities persist with new gtlds for up to  days after icann signs a contract with a registry operator and even then only where revocation capabilities are enabled additionally residual vulnerabilities may exist even longer in closed environments eg air gapped or with other instantiations where relying party software cannot or is otherwise provisioned to not support certificate revocation list crl andor online certificate status protocol ocsp certificate validation status checking functions unfortunately one could imagine scenarios where attackers could leverage the day issuance window to initiate and exploit certificate issuance in order to attack relying parties for up to  days after the contract is signed or perhaps even to specifically target specific relying party software or organizations that do not download crls or support ocsp eg browsers that disable checking in order to minimize latency enterprises that block downloads or filter ocsp transactions etc icann also needs to develop a process and capability to notify cas as soon as these contracts are signed as that infrastructure does not exist yet cas cant be subscribed to such a notification capability as of yet once this contract registry has been established and the format specification made public cas will need to automate ingestion and certificate revocation functions from icann based on the registry contract signing dates provided therein and notify their own customers under this framework that those corresponding certificates must be andor have been revoked it would seem natural that cas would not revoke any certificates until the final day of the day window as under the ballot provisions provided they very well may have just issued the certificate and collected associated monies or intend to issue it within the upcoming  day window note that if the above contract registry exists and is made publicly available it should be expected that miscreants will surely exploit the information as well and the current model could actually lead to “runs” on certificates related to newly delegated namespace an astute reader might surmise that it may well be advised to delay delegation of a new gtld until at least  days has passed since icann has signed the contract and compliant cas have revoked any issued certificates that relate to that namespace although as noted above this would only address a portion of the residual vulnerability another consideration is the current wording the cab forum ballot referenced in the  advisory if a wildcard would fall within the label immediately to the left of a registrycontrolled or public suffix cas must refuse issuance unless the applicant proves its rightful control of the entire domain namespace eg cas must not issue “couk” or “local” but may issue “examplecom” to example co specifically the text leaves some ambiguities for cas to issue certificates for new gtld holders themselves who could then exploit the vulnerabilities for child domains within the gtld this could potentially result in security and privacy issues for  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  internet users and fosters the sort of interdisciplinary concerns that have been raised for several years “rightful control” can be hard to prove because there is no general accepted way of communicating which specific entities have rights to which portions of the domain namespace similar to the problem with “zone cuts” described next regarding recommendations  through  of sac on march   icann published the first coordinated vulnerability disclosure reporting at icann practice statement describing the basic principles of coordinated vulnerability disclosure reporting as practiced by icann b suffix lists cookies and administrative boundaries in the dns the inbailiwick scope of cookies is already an acknowledged threat to internet browsing consumer privacy and internet security in general a cookie for examplecom could be used to affect subzoneexamplecom the way this is addressed currently is an annotated trusted list or repository of zone cuts administrative boundaries  that browsers fetch in order to disambiguate where zone cuts exist and therefore cookie authority ends with the addition of new gtlds a number of problems arise the process of mapping dns evolving zone cuts into a standard file that is then fetched and ingested by browsers is itself architecturally ill advised because much like the issues “certificate pinning” introduces in browsers it codifies dns dynamic structure in an offline medium the result is that the representation of dns contained there will likely always tend towards being out of date no matter how fast the dns is polled and then flattened into a file zone cuts may well have just changed in addition to the primitives associated with authority trust and creation of the zone cut file itself there exists the problem of browsers fetching and maintaining it the primary mechanisms that are in use today have not been cataloged or measured and as such it is not clear how well they are working interestingly at the time of this writing we observe that the mozilla repository is currently unprotected ie it lacks both https and certification credentials from a ca however by inspection we can infer that as the mapping file grows and churn increases at the highest levels of the namespace hierarchy ie new gtlds it becomes more likely to be stale and the process of ingesting it into all browsers and other applications inherits this staleness and adds its own the larger size file will cause greater resources to be needed on the server side and slower synchronization on the browser side while this further enshrines the heightened complexity of the browser and broader internet application ecosystem it also opens a potential vulnerability and variability window also with the fanout that new gtlds will prompt many existing zones are likely to create doppelgangers under new gtlds that is examplecom will likely seek examplenewgtld etc this will lead to a greater corpus for browsers to poll and serialize and will tend to increase the likelihood of zone cuts being unsynchronized with browser mapping files some work  albeit under considerable debate has been proposed in various forums to address one aspects of this problem but there are many other interacting elements that need to be considered and operationally integrated in order to mitigate the risks from the delegation of any new gtlds the impact related to the introduction of new gtlds may well result in insecurity for widely deployed web security and cookie mechanisms and potentially contribute to the loss of consumer confidence and erosion of consumer privacy and trust in the internet as well as broader security and stability implications yet unforeseen it is critical that work on interactive complexity and interactions of the proposed delegation and operation of new gtlds with mainstream fixed and mobile devices and applications such as web browsers and smartphone applications security software and hardware and broader infrastructure be examined in short order c interactive complexity and interdisciplinary studies the implications of new gtlds on external systems has been a concern of the icann ssac and much more broadly in the community since new gtlds were first proposed as a matter of fact the introduction of info over a decade ago highlighted just what sort of obvious and nuanced interdependencies may exist as new gtlds are delegated and made available on the internet while applications and other systems are illprepared as provided in the previous two sections internal name certificates and administrative boundaries pinned to dns zone cuts provide opportunity for internet usability safety and security issues to arise the proper functioning and expectations of new gtld holders and the consumer confidence trust and security associated with services residing under those new gtlds is clearly paramount to the success of the new gtld program the following quoted text contains an excerpt from a security week article  authored by ram mohan in august  and captures the essence of some issues to be considered with the introduction of new gtlds  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  getting to universal acceptance of all domains ensuring that internet software and sites understand all domains  not just the old threeletter domains like com and net  is called universal acceptance for example when is the last time you looked at your companys online contact forms if you havent revisited them for a while you might discover that they are hard coded for certain domains like net or org and may reject email addresses that use say a fouror morecharacter domain like info or mobi full disclosure info and mobi are both domains managed by my company afilias or have you seen some tlds that dont work in your browser some browsers including mobile ones screen out addresses as either “right” or “wrong” and many modern tlds simply dont resolve because the browser doesnt understand how to handle the tld a reallife example as late as  you could not email an article from the new york times website to anybody with a info email address which was actually fun for some of my colleagues because they would try to send me articles and say ”oh you didnt see it maybe you should get a com address” some software and websites contain restraints that limit the scope of what is considered a valid domain name and in the process impose artificial  and many times unintended  boundaries on the emails and websites that will or wont  be accepted some of these universal acceptance issues are caused by improper logic in software for checking valid domains or older software that requires an upgrade other universal acceptance issues can be caused by a lack of support for internationalized domain names idns which are domain labels that incorporate accent marks or nonascii characters like chinese hindi and hebrew idns are six percent of all the new gtlds currently applied for and given that they havent been widely used until now its likely that many websites and internet applications wont recognize them as toplevel domains icann has been discussing the issue of universal acceptance for years and at my own company afilias we had the “fun” in  of launching the first fourletter tld  info  that wasnt accepted practically anywhere from that experience i developed my three “rules” of tld acceptance  an old tld will be accepted more often than a new tld  an asciionly tld will be accepted more than an idn tld  a threeletter gtld will be accepted more often than a longer string even if its a gtld universal tld acceptance must overcome these three rules and with the upcoming addition of hundreds of new tlds and idns the problems that result due to a lack of universal tld acceptance have quickly moved to the front burner as a global issue related to the notion of universal acceptance the ssac made  recommendations  to the icann board related to root scaling and new gtlds recommendation  formalize and publicly document the interactions between icann and the root server operators with respect to root zone scaling icann and the root server operators may choose to utilize rssac to facilitate this interaction recommendation  icann national telecommunications and information administration ntia and verisign should publish statements or a joint statement that they are materially prepared for the proposed changes recommendation  icann should publish estimates of expected and maximum growth rates of tlds including idns and their variants and solicit public feedback on these estimates with the end goal of being as transparent as possible about the justification for these estimates recommendation  icann should update its ”plan for enhancing internet security stability and resiliency” to include actual measurement monitoring and datasharing capability of root zone performance in cooperation with rssac and other root zone management participants to define the specific measurements monitoring and data sharing framework  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  recommendation  icann should commission and incent interdisciplinary studies of security and stability implications from expanding the root zone more than an order of magnitude particularly for enterprises and other user communities who may implement strong assumptions about the number of tlds or use local tlds that may conflict with future allocations as discussed in the root server system section earlier in the document these five recommendations were provided to the icann board in  the first and fourth recommendation have not been accommodated as of yet whereas recommendations  and  have been accommodated but with varying levels of fanfare recommendation  various aspects of which are reflected in some of the text earlier in this section and some of which are reflected in the advisory released just last week has resulted in numerous letters exchanged over the past three years between the icann board and the ssac albeit with little to no actual action by the icann board to ameliorate the issues provided therein much to the frustration of some members of the ssac to further illustrate this point yet another letter is being drafted by an ssac work party addressed to the icann board as of this writing the crux of which is that the ssac believes that the community would benefit from further inquiry into lingering issues related to the expansion of the root zone as a consequence of the new gtld program furthermore issues that previous public comment periods have suggested were inadequately explored as well as issues related to crossfunctional interactions of the changes brought about by root zone growth should be investigated and that additional perspective regarding stubbornly unresolved concerns about the longerterm management of the expanded root zone and related systems would be prudent icann needs to seriously consider these issues before new gtlds are operationalized as the safety and security of internet users and the infrastructure itself is at risk vi c onclusion the recent disclosure of issues with internal name certificates and the broader implications of new gtlds to parties that rely on the internet dns will be farreaching if these issues are not addressed by icann in a timely manner addressing these issues doesnt simply mean publishing a specification and expecting the community to have immediately implemented it and be capable of responding to all operational and security corner cases conveyed therein it means working with the community in attempts to identify these issues before problems arise in operational systems it also means that adequate buffers should exist in icann published timelines that account for implementation internal testing security auditing and vulnerability testing pilots and early field trials and deliberate transition to operations its apparent little consideration has been given to this in the current timelines published by icann in order to ensure a successful implementation of each new gtld it is essential that proper planning be conducted in advance this entails the development of a project plan to include a detailed schedule communications plan risk management plan and deployment plan for each new gtld to be implemented these plans should align with icanns timelines thus minimizing impacts to current registry operations as well as the overall dns and broader internet ecosystem any party concerned with consumer and operator privacy trust confidence and overall security of new gtlds and the broader internet would be well served by the icann board addressing these issues as appropriate before delegating any new gtlds as the risk of a misstep in this direction could have farreaching and longlasting residual implications  verisign inc all rights reserved  verisign labs technical report   version  r eferences    report to congress china economic and
