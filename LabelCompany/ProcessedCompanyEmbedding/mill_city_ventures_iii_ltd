declined from dec   mil to dec   mil and declined from dec   mil to dec   mil definition property plant and equipment ppe are the fixed assets of the companyfixed assets are also known as noncurrent assets property plant and equipment includes assets that will  in the normal course of business  neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers some of the most common parts of property plant and equipment are  land  buildings and leasehold improvements  transportation equipment  manufacturing equipment  office equipment  office furniture companies with lots of property plant and equipment often have special categories for example railroad property includes  track  ties  ballast  bridges  tunnels  signals  locomotives  freight cars there is often a note in the financial statements  found in a companys k  that will explain the different categories of property a company owns the market value of property plant and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property plant and equipment for example when berkshire hathaway liquidated its textile mills it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away that property plant and equipment was literally worth less than zero on the other hand some companies own thousands of acres of land all property plant and equipment other than land is depreciated land is never depreciated however land is not marked up to market value either under generally accepted accounting principles gaap land is shown on the balance sheet at cost the property plant and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property plant and equipment this means it is the cost of the property plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation explanation a company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive the company replaces when it wears out on the other hand a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits there is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures think coca cola johnson  johnson etc related terms total assets accumulated depreciation gross property plant and equipment historical data  all numbers are in millions except for per
