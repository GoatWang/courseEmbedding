financial results and expectations we discuss today are on a continuing operations basis reconciliations of the nongaap measures we discuss today to gaap measures are included in today’s press release now here’s tom thomas kingsbury thank you bob good morning everyone our first quarter saw expansion in operating margin and a  increase in adjusted net income per share which exceeded our guidance as noted on our yearend call on march  first quarter sales got off to a slow start driven by the later timing of tax refunds while february sales were down high single digits we were pleased to see momentum build as the quarter progressed with the comp sales for the combined march and april period rising  this gave us a  positive comp for the quarter on top of last year’s  increase total sales rose  on track with our expectations driven by comp growth and an increasing contribution from new and noncomp stores it is worth noting that may is off to a solid start a few other notable highlights for the first quarter include this was our th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth we delivered an  basis point expansion in gross margin which helped to drive a  basis point increase in adjusted ebitda margin and our adjusted net income per share growth of  our top performing businesses were home beauty missy sportswear men’s shoes athletic shoes and handbags in terms of the territories the west southeast and northeast were the best performing regions and the southwest and the midwest underperformed the company average with regards to our inventory management this quarter we were very pleased with how our merchandising team maintained a disciplined approach to managing our receipts especially given that we came in at the lower end of our total sales guidance in addition we continued to see increases in our branded and better and best receipt unit penetration versus the prior year comparable store inventory decreased by  at quarter end and we saw inventory aged  days and older decline versus the prior year as we focused on maintaining a fresh and exciting assortment for our customers pack and hold as a percent of our total inventory was  versus  a year ago given the current disruption we are seeing throughout retail the marketplace remains vibrant for our buying teams and we are thrilled with the great assortments and amazing values that we continue to deliver to our customers i’m also pleased with the value that we continue to bring to our shareholders as we repurchased over  shares of common stock during the first quarter for  million we have  million remaining on our share repurchase authorization now let me touch on our longterm strategic priorities focusing on driving comparable store sales growth expanding our store fleet and increasing our operating margins first with regards to driving comparable store sales growth our underlying strategies remain one enhancing our assortments as we continue to improve our execution of the offprice model with particular focus on underpenetrated businesses two continue to improve the store experience for our customers and three building out our marketing initiatives to make sure that we are continuing to engage both new and existing customers across our business we continue to believe that we have significant opportunities to increase our penetration across several categories including home beauty and ladies apparel with regard to home during the first quarter we added our indiscernible to the home category in support of our current and expected growth in addition to building our penetration of highly recognizable national brands across many areas of the home we will look to grow housewares by increasing our investment in key entertaining categories reshaping our cookware and bakeware assortments and maximizing opportunities in kitchen storage and organization in home décor we look to elevate and expand our assortments in home accents seasonal stationary and furniture finally we believe we can accelerate our growth in pet by maximizing impulse treat and toy categories as we mentioned on our last call we ended  with a home penetration of  and we continue to set our sights on a  penetration rate which is more in line with our peers our beauty business continues to be a key merchandising opportunity for us this area has consistently outperformed the company average and in  we will focus on increasing the breadth of designer and prestige fragrances expanding our product offering in accessories and reacting more quickly to emerging trends in cosmetics as we’ve mentioned before this area lends itself to gifting which will be a key focus throughout the year ladies apparel continues to be another significant opportunity as we ended last year at a  penetration level well below our peer group at approximately  our strategies in  will be to grow missy sportswear by increasing the better and branded levels in all doors continue to fund the strong active growth that we are experiencing rebuilding our assortments in better and social dresses and suits and investing in the plus size opportunity our store experience continues to be an important initiative for us we are pleased that our overall satisfaction scores have increased each year on a consistent basis since we began tracking in  the underlying metrics have also shown strong growth including friendliness speed of checkout cleanliness and ease of movement in an effort to provide the best possible shopping experience for our customers we are planning to remodel  stores in  we are committed to spending capital to improve our store portfolio and expect this will continue in the future from a marketing point of view we will continue to reach our customers through our testimonial campaign featuring real customers in our stores we consistently hear positive feedback from customers about the commercials and we are pleased with how they score relative to the percent of people who remember the ad and can name the brand in  our dollar spend will be similar to last year now moving to our second growth initiative expanding our store fleet we ended the quarter with  stores adding four net new stores averaging  square feet we continue to be pleased with our new stores and our smaller store formats stores less than  square feet continue to achieve sales productivity well above our comp base in total new and noncomp stores contributed an incremental  million to our q sales for the year we continue to expect to open  net new stores with an average square footage of  square feet this will consist of approximately  new stores including six relocations and eight pure closures given the strong performance we have experienced in our new stores and the real estate opportunities that continue to be presented to us we remain confident in our ability to expand to  stores over the long term finally we remain focused on our third growth priority to continue to deliver operating margin expansion from  through  we expanded our ebit margins by  basis points while we are very pleased with the result there is still significant opportunity versus our peer group on a go forward basis we will continue to execute the same game plan that we have run over the last four years driving total sales increases to leverage fixed costs optimizing markdowns remaining disciplined with inventory management and maintaining an active profit improvement culture across all sga areas now i’d like to turn the call over to marc to review our financial performance and outlook in more detail marc katz thanks tom and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today we began the year by recording our th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales in addition we achieved strong contribution from new stores expansion in gross margin and strong sga control which combined delivered a  increase in adjusted net income per share turning to a review of the income statement for the first quarter total sales increased  and comparable store sales increased  on top of last year’s  increase as tom noted the delay in the issuance of tax refunds impacted february comparable store sales and while we were pleased to see combined march and april sales rebound to a  comp it was not enough to fully offset the slow start to the quarter for many of our comp metrics we’re comparing march and april together because of the threeweek shift in easter this year versus last year for the quarter our comparable store sales performance was driven by increases in units per transaction while we experienced slight declines in traffic conversion and average unit retail versus last year for the combined march and april period we did see an increase in traffic it is worth noting that through the first three weeks of may we have also seen an increase in traffic the gross margin rate was  an increase of  basis points versus last year driven primarily by increased merchandise margin product sourcing costs which are included in sga and include the cost of processing goods through our supply chain and buying costs improved  basis points from last year as a percentage of total sales sga exclusive of product sourcing costs decreased to  and  last year this improvement was driven by a decrease in marketing expenses business insurance costs utilities and the timing of approximately  million of expenses that were planned in the first quarter but will now be incurred in the second quarter of fiscal  this allowed us to offset headwinds from increased wages and stockbased compensation costs that we discussed on the last call other income decreased approximately  basis points primarily driven by last year’s sale of the company’s new jersey grow tax credits of approximately  million during the first quarter we had planned for a similar sale of tax credits in q of this year but that is now expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal  adjusted ebitda increased  or  million to  million sales growth and margin expansion led to a  basis point expansion in rate for the quarter depreciation and amortization expense exclusive of net favorable lease amortization increased  million to  million and interest expense decreased  million to  million the effective tax rate on a gaap basis improved  basis points to  driven primarily by the adoption of the new accounting for sharebased compensation which contributed  basis points of the improvement exclusive of the accounting change for sharebased compensation our effective tax rate was  compared with  during last year’s first quarter the improvement was primarily driven by an increase in federal hiring credits combined this resulted in adjusted net income of  million an increase of  compared to last year we continued to return value to our shareholders through our share repurchase program during the quarter we repurchased over  shares of stock for  million we now have  million remaining on our share repurchase authorization that was approved last year this resulted in diluted net income per share of  versus  last year and diluted adjusted net income per share of  versus  last year the  per share represents a  beat versus our top end guidance this beat was split between  of true operating performance driven by our top line growth margin expansion and sga expense control the remaining  beat was due to a  benefit from the adoption of the new sharebased compensation accounting as a reminder we guided a  benefit for the adoption of the new sharebased compensation accounting turning to our balance sheet at quarter end we had  million in cash  million in outstanding borrowings on our abl and had unused credit availability of approximately  million we ended the period with total debt of  billion and a debt leverage ratio of  times merchandise inventories were  million versus  million last year this decrease was due to a  decline in comparable store inventory which contributed to a  improvement in comparable store inventory turnover as well as a decrease in pack and hold inventory pack and hold inventory as a percentage of total inventory represented  at the end of the first quarter of fiscal  compared with  at the end of the first quarter last year cash flow provided by operations decreased  million to  million primarily related to a decrease in our accounts payable partially offset by our improved operating results capital expenditures net of landlord incentives were  million for the first quarter during the quarter we opened seven new stores and closed three stores ending the period with  stores we continue to expect to open  net new stores for the year turning to our outlook for the  fiscal year which includes a rd week we now expect total sales growth in the range of  to  inclusive of  which is related to the rd week in the fourth quarter comparable stores sales to increase in the range of  to  for the balance of the year resulting in a fullyear increase in the range of  to  on top of last year’s  increase adjusted ebitda margin expansion of  to  basis points interest expense to approximate  million and adjusted tax rate of approximately  we expect the new accounting rules related to sharebased compensation to have a favorable impact of approximately  basis points on the effective tax rate in  net capital expenditures to be approximately  million  as mentioned during our fourth quarter call this is higher than in prior years and is due to the  total new store projects tom mentioned earlier and an approximate  million spend in supply chain which is  million over last year depreciation and amortization exclusive of favorable leased amortization to be approximately  million this results in adjusted diluted net income per share guidance in the range of  to  utilizing a fully diluted share count of approximately  million versus  actual adjusted diluted net income per share of  please note the rd week is expected to have a  per diluted share positive impact in the fourth quarter of the year and the change in sharebased compensation accounting is expected to have a  positive impact for the year as a reminder our initial  annual guidance was  to  for the second quarter of  we expect total sales to increase in the range of  to  and comparable store sales to increase between  and  on top of last year’s  increase diluted adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of  to  utilizing a fully diluted share count of approximately  million versus  per share last year this reflects a  benefit from the recent accounting change for sharebased compensation now i would like to turn the call back over to tom for concluding remarks thomas kingsbury thanks marc in summary we believe our results this quarter demonstrate the agility of our business model we drove total sales in line with our expectations and earnings above our expectations despite the shortterm impact on consumer spending from later tax refunds we remain confident in our outlook and believe our focus on evolving our offprice model and the ability to capitalize on the rapidly changing retail landscape positions us well to bring more great brands styles and value to our customers and increased value for our shareholders with that i’d like to turn the call over to the operator to begin the question and answer portion of the call operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ike boruchow with wells fargo please proceed with your question ike boruchow hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my question i have a question for tom and then i just have a followup for marc tom as we think about the business not making up the difference from the february dropoff are there areas of the store that you can talk about that maybe you were disappointed in and then i guess to that point is it fair to assume that these areas are trending better throughout the quarter and into may thomas kingsbury hi ike as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we were really pleased with home beauty missy sportswear men’s and athletic shoes and handbags they outperformed the chain average but candidly we were disappointed in our apparel business it underperformed in the first quarter we had the perfect storm  it was warm in february and cool in march versus the prior year but the good news is that when the weather improved in april and so far in may we’ve seen improvement across all apparel zones including ladies men’s and youth ike boruchow great and then marc just a followup can you maybe provide some more color on the  bps improvement in the gross margin relative to the  bps decrease in the product sourcing costs i think it’s been a while since we’ve seen leverage there and then as we get into the back half of the year should we start to see a little bit of favorability on the sga line as you lap i think  wages thanks marc katz okay let’s start with the  basis points of gross margin improvement that beat was a combination of a lower markdown rate and improved imu with the markdown rate being a little heavier weighted there the improved imu is not new  we talked about that throughout last year the markdown rate we ended  very clean from an aging point of view so we were expecting good news in our gross margin rate and even though we came in at the lower end of our sales guidance it’s really a credit to our merchandising team for how well they managed receipts throughout the quarter you know it’s one of the great things about our model and really having liquidity is the receipt dollars can be spent to chase trends when the trends are there or not spend depending on the business need so all in tom mentioned comp store inventories down  aging down felt really good about margin in total as it relates to product sourcing costs yes you’re right  the  basis point reduction i don’t think we saw that last year we may have seen it in one quarter in ’ but certainly something that’s atypical it was driven by two factors ike the first was labor savings in our dcs due to fewer units moving in and out of our storage locations within our dcs as you know we store pack and hold goods and we store what we call shortstay inventory that’s the inventory we use when we have multiple allocations of the same style to prevent too much item depth in our stores that less movement in and out of the storage locations that we experienced in q right now we do not have it planned for that same thing to happen in q q or q the other factor that really drove it was profit improvements that were put in place by our supply chain team we build some of those into our plan primarily more in the back half throughout the course of the year and the team just did a fantastic job right out of the gate implementing some initiatives that paid dividends in the quarter we talked about product sourcing costs a number of times we’re going to continue to invest in our merchant organization continue to invest in our supply chain both are critical to our model we’re certainly encouraged by these two factors that we saw within the quarter but one quarter doesn’t make a trend so we’ll continue to watch this closely in terms of product sourcing costs in the rest of the year and our annual guide we still have deleverage and product sourcing costs baked in i think your final question just the overall sga and ebitda expansion so over the course of the year we said  to  basis points improvement in ebitda rate fifty of that is going to come from the net of reported margin less product sourcing and then at the high end of our sales range we’ll pick up  basis points in sga and that’s what gets us to  ike boruchow great thanks so much guys marc katz you got it thomas kingsbury thanks ike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matthew boss with jp morgan please proceed with your questions matthew boss thanks so on your new store growth what percent of your fleet is in the smaller format today and can you just walk through the cash returns you’re seeing payback period and what level of comps do you see out of the gates versus your older legacy stores marc katz okay so our stores less than  square feet are still performing matt well above the chain average i think at the end of the year we gave that stat at  fair to assume that that hasn’t changed at all now here’s a stat i can give you on new stores as we watch these as we continue to get smaller in size theyre more productive and also just to add onto that certainly the occupancy rates are higher in these stores because we’re more the retail hub let’s specifically talk about our  and  new store cohort because i think you’re trying to get to how are they comping versus the chain so in  our  and  new store cohorts they outcomped the chain by  basis points and their ebit rates increased  basis points over what the chain increased so we are starting to see the gap between their overall ebits come closer to the chain average the ‘s and the’s as i said outcomped and they had better improvements in their ebit increase matthew boss that’s great and then just a followup tom i guess if you dig further into same store sales and the traffic that you’ve seen basically for the last two and a half months  march april and may so far larger picture is there anything different in the performance versus what you were seeing prefebruary meaning is there any hangover effect whatsoever to consider here and just given what you’ve seen in the past two and a half months what’s been your biggest learning and as we think about the back half what do you think the biggest opportunity is in the cash versus last year from a top line perspective thomas kingsbury okay hi matt no i don’t think there’s anything really structurally different than what we were experiencing prior to february again as i mentioned we were really in a deficit based on thein february based on the tax refund delay but as we got into march and april and now in may we’re back to where we were before as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we still think the biggest opportunity is what i have mentioned many times before in the back half is continuing to drive our home business continue to grow our beauty business make up the differential we have in ladies apparel so we’re still focused on those initiatives and we really feel that those are going to really lead our business not only this year for but years to come matthew boss great best of luck marc katz thanks matt thomas kingsbury thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lorraine hutchinson with bank of america please proceed with your question lorraine hutchinson thank you good morning can you talk a little bit about the aur pressure that you experienced in the first quarter and then how you see that metric trending for the remainder of the year marc katz sure lorraine a decline in aur for us obviously is not new  it’s been happening for many quarters now and it’s reallyit continues to be driven by two things one is the mix shift just within our businesses with home and beauty becoming a bigger part of our mix they both have aurs lower than the chain and secondly our desire to continue to pass on value to our customers is also putting a drain on aur on the flipside we have seen an increase in upts which has been offsetting that lower aur and increasing overall basket so we’re pleased with that but in terms of going forward i think that negative pressure is going to remain from a mix point of view you know tom talked about home and beauty and they’re only going to grow in penetration and it’s also going to remain from us passing on value to our customers so we don’t see that going away i guess somewhat of an offset will be as we continue to increase our better and best penetration that should help offset it to some extent but we’re still expecting a slight decrease in aur lorraine hutchinson thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john kernan with cowen  company please proceed with your question john kernan good morning everyone thanks for taking my question marc katz morning john thomas kingsbury morning john john kernan on the theme of gross margin the benefits of imu i think you’ve been benefiting from that foryou know as we go back through last year i just wonder how durable those benefits are and how much longer you think you can continue to get these higher imus to offset some of the markdowns within merchandise margin marc katz yes you faded out there at the end john but i heard your initial question  it’s just about imus and how many legs does that have you know it was strong all last year it’s strong this year i think and we’re still seeing it across all buy types so it’s not limited just to certain buy type i think it’s a credit to the merchandising team and i think each year as we get more mature they just get better at buying and that’s a big piece of it but i think it’s two things that will continue to play into our gross margins going forward  it’s that and we still think that and we will plan our comp store inventories to be down mid to high single digits we’re going to continue to turn faster and that’s going to reduce markdowns for us so in terms of the longer term play we continue to see benefits coming from both areas imu and a lower markdown rate john kernan okay that’s helpful then just one quick followup the expectations for merchandise margin as we go through the rest of the year and the back half of the year with your  to  basis points of ebitda margin expansion marc katz yes so what we said was the  was the net between reported margin and product sourcing costs and you can expect a little bit of deleverage in the product sourcing cost john kernan thanks best of luck marc katz thanks thomas kingsbury thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lindsay drucker mann with goldman sachs please proceed with your question lindsay drucker mann thanks good morning everyone i was hoping you could describe the performance of your stores in close proximity or in the same malls as macy’s that have closed whether the going out of business sales impacted your business or whether you feel you’ve picked up market share or been negatively affected by weaker traffic in those areas marc katz yes lindsay we really studied that with last year’s closings to be honest with you and as we were looking at the  ones it was following in a similar pattern long story short after the course of the year and what happened in  our stores that were colocated so within  miles so that was either right in the same mall or within half a mile over the course of the year they saw a slight drop we think just due to the overall traffic drop our stores that were between half a mile and five miles away from a macy’s store over the course of the year saw a slight pickup so netnet in what we looked at in  was a slight pickup but to be honest with you it really wasn’t material overall in terms of this year we have  stores that are within five miles of their closing and  inside of  miles lindsay drucker mann great thank you tom you talked about the disruption in retail today creating opportunities i was hoping you could describe how your team sees availability today versusavailability of buys today versus what you might typically see heading into this time of year thomas kingsbury well i think it’s pretty typical in terms of what’s available we’ve always had a lot of merchandising opportunities to get product it really hasn’t changed it maybe accelerated a little bit more but there’s always a lot of goods that we can buy i’ve said this many times before  we turn down more deals every day than we accept so as the disruption continues i’m sure the flow of goods will be plentiful but it’s pretty much same as always there’s just a lot of goods available for us to purchase lindsay drucker mann great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kimberly greenberger with morgan stanley please proceed with your question kimberly greenberger great thank you good morning marc i just had a clarification for you and then a question for tom on ladies apparel in terms of the shifting of expenses out of q into q it sounded like there is  million of sga that was a benefit in q that will be a deficit in q i think you said a  million sale of a tax credit that was supposed to land in q but that’s getting pushed out to q do those effectively or nearly net out in each of those two quarters i just want to make sure i understand the impact correctly marc katz well said well done exactly kimberly greenberger okay great then on ladies apparel tom it sounds like one of your key strategies to grow your ladies apparel penetration is increasing i think you said better and branded goods i’m reading that to mean better and best  you can tell me if i’m reading that correctly and is that a reflection of the fact that you’re seeing better availability in those nicer goods or do you think that that’s simply just the more effective way to grow your market share in the category thanks thomas kingsbury it’s really strategic we really feel that we’ve gotten really good response in better and best product and we want to continue to really skew our buys into that type of product overall the goods are available but most importantly it’s reallyit’s really a successful strategy for us and we want to just continue to do that kimberly greenberger thanks thomas kingsbury thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul lejuez with citi please proceed with your question tracy kogan thanks it’s tracy kogan filling in for paul i had two questions the first is on the eight stores you’re closing i was wondering is there any commonality in terms of geography or real estate type of these stores and are they all larger format then secondly in the home category you’ve got a competitor introducing a new home concept this year and we are just wondering if this changes your strategy at all in the home category or the subcategories you’ll be pursuing within home thanks thomas kingsbury i’ll answer the home question then marc can answer the closure question no not really we’re still focused on the things that i talked about in the prepared remarks we really feel that the strategy that we have put in place is really the best strategy to really grow the business overall so no not really we’re not changing anything we’re doing in terms of home we just want to continue to bridge the gap that we have versus our competitors marc katz as far as the eight stores tracy they are low ebit contributors their leases were coming up and yes they are predominantly bigger stores tracy kogan and no commonalty in terms of geography or real estate type or marc katz no no tracy kogan are any of them mallbased marc katz i don’t believe so but i’d have to doublecheck that tracy kogan okay great thanks guys thomas kingsbury thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john morris with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question john morris thanks hey good morning and let me just say congratulations on great execution in a very challenging environment marc katz thanks john john morris marc i think first question for you it’s kind of a variation on some of the earlier real estate questions i know we’re emphasizing the productivity better productivity of the smaller stores but as you think about your opening cadence of  this year anything changing in consideration of the store formats as the mall itself and those kind of malltype locations evolve given the challenges of the department stores and what i would imagine would be available space coming over the years some of that larger space so i’m wondering the degree of flexibility or how you think about that with respect to the footprint size  like would you take advantage of it for example marc katz well you know one thing to keep in mind as you think about all the store closings that are happening and john you know them as well as i do a lot of them are coming from either anchors or tenants in c and d malls so that’s obviouslythat’s not where we want to be that’s not a real help to us but with that said when you have a retailer like a sports authority who goes out of business you know somebody that was strip mall located that their store sizes were kind of a lot more right in our wheelhouse those have been good opportunities for us and john we’ll probably end up with as we look at our pipeline right now we’ll probably look at obtaining over  sports authority locations by the time it’s all said and done john morris and do thesorry go ahead marc katz i was just going to say but we’re staying primarily strip mall focused the retail hubs in strip malls kind of where other people want to be too thomas kingsbury yes and the store closures that are happening are really in the malls that are not productive so it really doesn’t lend itself to really for us as a big opportunity because obviously we want to be where there’s a lot of traffic john morris okay good my followup is you guys do a great job with your new customer acquisition initiative maybe if you can update us there and tell us a little bit about your approach in coming quarters and into the back half and your progress on new customer acquisition initiatives did that one stump you guys thomas kingsbury no no i was waiting for marc well you know we have really done a nice job of really growing our customer base we’re very pleased our tv commercials as i mentioned in the prepared remarks they’ve been really resonating with consumers and as i’ve mentioned previously we’re growing customers that make over  a year and actually last year growing customers that made over  a year it’s about what’s happening inside the store the customer experience continues to get better and better and our customer service scores continue to improve obviously that really helps and it brings in more customers the fact that we’re continuously growing our better and best penetration in brands and our branded penetration in general that is obviously helping us also in terms of getting a different customer we’re finding customers thatyou know the band household income is  to  the customers that make less than  they’re leaving us they’re going someplace else so we feel good about the fact that we’re able to attract a higher income customer and it gives us obviously a broader base of customers john morris good yes i was wondering if that trend was continuing okay thanks guys marc katz thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dana telsey with telsey advisor group please proceed with your question dana telsey hi good morning everyone i’ve been noticing that you have been getting some of the better goods whether it’s the gucci’s the burberry’s the prada’s in there as you think of your mix and your assortment where does it go are you seeing higher margins on that and given the store closures are there categories or brands that you see an opportunity for that you didn’t before thank you thomas kingsbury well most of the names that you mentioned are really only in their ecommerce site sobut you know in general we have more and more opportunities to bring in better goods but it’s really more related to what i said previously it’s more about the strategy that we’re embarking on in terms of garnering more better and best product overall it doesn’t really have a whole lot to do with all the different store closures and stuff like that it’s more about the strategy that we’re trying to accomplish dana telsey then as you think about the store closures that are happening out there are you able toare there any boxes that you would want would you ever think of entering the mall landscape at all is that something with some of the rents and deals that may be offered that would be of appeal to you thomas kingsbury well first of all we look at every deal and if there’s good economics we may consider doing something in a mall but in general we really want to be in strip centers and that is what our strategy is overall but we are opportunistic as we are at buying product and we would consider it we would look at it but we would prefer not to be in a mall dana telsey thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of pamela quintiliano with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question david schick hi this is david for pam thanks for taking our questions just a followup to the multiple real estate questions given the store closures across the industry how is that impacting your real estate opportunities in terms of lease renewals marc katz i’m sorry could you repeat that question david schick given the store closures how is that impacting your real estate opportunities in terms of lease renewals as you go forward in terms of economics marc katz yes sure so let’s talk about just what’s happening this year  so we had roughly the  leases that were expiring so i’ll kind of give you a breakdown of them to give you a feel for what’s happening in  locations we’ve exercised our options and extended term we were able to get rent reductions in six of the locations as we talked about we’re relo and closing  locations and two of them we’re able to give space back to our landlords and then we’re able to remodel and actual get some lease incentive money for the other two so that kind of gives you the complexion of the leases that we dealt with in ’ which would probably be the goforward proxy for future david schick great thanks then in terms of ecommerce i know it hasn’t been a major focus but any updated thoughts on potentially expanding your presence thomas kingsbury well you know ecommerce is less than  of our business we’ll see growth in ecommerce but not a lot of growth it’s just really hard to replicate the offprice model online overall and our main focus is growing our brick and mortar business we feel we’ve done a very good job so far and we want to continue to work on the customer experience as i mentioned before in our stores so no ecommerce is just not a huge focus for us overall because it’s a very small piece of our business david schick okay thanks lastly any updates on baby depot thomas kingsbury yes baby depot obviously is a small business for us overall but it is an important differentiator for us we didn’t do well in baby depot in the first quarter  it underperformed the chain average overall i still feel that our strategy is a good strategy and that we should see growth in baby depot in the second quarter and the back half of the year based on all the initiatives we’ve done but in the first quarter it underperformed the chain david schick great thank you very much marc katz okay before we move on operator i just want to clarify one of the answers we were asked about the eight store closures this year four of our eight closures are going to be in malls thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian tunick with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question unknown analyst hi good morning this is indiscernible for brian thanks for taking our question i guess first on sga i think you mentioned lower marketing expense in the quarter just wanted to see if that was a response to the traffic trends in the quarter or are you getting more efficient with your marketing maybe shifting the mix more towards digital and social media and then the shrink piece in gross margins last year you were more prudent with shrink accruals through the year and that turned into a benefit in q so just wanted to see how you’re accruing for shrink this year maybe versus last year marc katz sure as far as the marketing goes yes i would say that it was predominantly more efficient marketing within the quarter and then we did have some timing in marketing as well so we had grand opening costs for four new stores that shifted from q to q so marketing actually played a role in both of those things as far as shrink goes we’re recording it what last year’s final rate was for the first three quarters so it is a slight good guy for the first three quarters and then we expect a slight bad guy in q based on what happened last year but overall on a full year basis the shrink accrual that’s baked into our guidance is just a few basis points lower than last year unknown analyst okay thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question andrew roberge hi good morning this is andrew roberge on for bob our question was just around the athletic space could you just give a little bit more on your performance there in both apparel and footwear thanks thomas kingsbury okay as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we had strong performance really across the board in all the active wear in terms of apparel and our athletic shoe business was very strong too so we see that continuing in the second quarter and the back half of the year andrew roberge okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of roxanne meyer with mkm partners please proceed with your questions roxanne meyer good morning and thanks for taking my question you talked about performance of your relatively newer stores over the past few years i’m wondering if you can give us an update on the performance of both your renovated and relocated stores and then as a followup you mentioned that traffic was up in may i’m just wondering if it’s fair to say that comps are in line with your guidance so far for the quarter thanks marc katz roxanne we typicallyfor the remodels that we’ve done in the past we have seen a nice lift in sales there so stores that we have remodeled historically have outcomped the chain average and then your second question was on roxanne meyer was on whether it’s fair to say that your comps so far are in line with your plan given that traffic is up marc katz yes our  to  guidance is the typical guidance that we give in a quarter we believe that it’s prudent to plan conservatively because that’s the expense base and receipts that we plan on that lower sales base and we really think that our merchants are very adept at chasing business when it’s there our intent obviously is to beat the  to  guidance but it incorporates everything  where we are now and what we think is going to happen in the rest of the quarter roxanne meyer okay great thanks a lot thomas kingsbury operator we have time for one more question operator thank you our final question for this morning will come from the line of adrienne yih with wolfe research please proceed with your question adrienne yih thank you good morning let me add my congratulations my first question is onjust to understand the inventory strategy obviously much more disciplined when you take a look at the much smaller footprint stores the   square foot versus the legacy stores when we think about that are you planning inventory per store or inventory per square foot right so is it in the absolute sense on a perstore basis then secondarily on the ladies apparel or the apparel business underperforming in the first quarter has that continued into may or is it back to plan and do you think it was a transitory sort of tax refund weather issue or is there something going on in apparel that’s highly promotional because obviously apparel is pretty weak across the board in general thank you very much marc katz i’ll take the inventory per store first then i’ll kick it over to tom we’ve made adrienne drastic reductions in our comp store inventories over time tom’s taken out i want to say  of the inventory since he started here so we just flat out don’t need the  square foot boxes anymore so going to the smaller stores gives us plenty of room to put in the inventory that we need but the inventory is really more of a function of the sales that we think the store’s going to do and that’s how we merchandise it adrienne yih thank you thomas kingsbury so as far as ladies apparel goes we’ve seen improvement as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we’ve seen an improvement actually starting in april and continuing in may once the weather normalized but we really feel with a warmer february and a cooler march it had a negative impact on apparel really across the company but no as it normalized weather normalized our performance improves adrienne yih very good thank you very much best of luck thomas kingsbury thank you marc katz thank you thomas kingsbury thanks for joining us

everything meant in regards to my misdemeanor charge it was very comforting since id never been in trouble before well it was until the one time my father also an attorney but of a different sort was not able to go to my court date with me mr keirnan didnt even bother to tell me that he wasnt going to show up at the beginning like i had to even though he had always been there from the start of court before i sat in the court room for  hours wondering where my attorney was and why i couldnt get an answer from him or his office as to what was going on finally my father who was on vacation decided to call casey and immediately got the answer he had other court appearances to make as well and attended those first apparently since my dad wasnt around by the time casey made it to the court room  hours after the session began the judge had gone home sick for the day since my court date kept getting reset i had to go a couple more times before it was settled in that time i tried to call mr keirnan in regards to my case with a question but he could never be bothered to return my calls only my fathers i guess even though i was his client he was simply too good to talk to me he chose to go through my father and only took time to make sure i understood what was happening when my father was around it was all for show yes he did his job and i have no complaints as to the results i just dont like the fact that i paid that much money to a man who couldnt even call me back about my case now that i am getting my record sealed i am going through the same bs with a lady in his office who handles nondisclosures and expunctures all the time i am downright pissed off at this point and regret ever going to this practice to begin with thanks to this lady my entire life is on hold still because she has yet to file the papers three weeks after cashing the check for payment in full she knows this also so i she either does not care or is incapable of finding out when the right time of day is to file the papers not very reassuring for someone who does this kind of thing all the time technically i could have had my record sealed two weeks ago but she cant even call me back at the times she says she will call me i have to hunt her down basically i could have handled this matter myself and had it all done and over with long ago in less than the amount of time she requires to manage to get herself to the court when the right person is thereif you have the need for a defense attorney youve already got enough stress to deal with dont add to it by hiring anyone in this office or this attorney either they obviously care only about the money the make from their job not the people they representbennett  bennett houston criminaldefense lawyersf b ratedif there be any doubt in your mind about selecting mark bennett to defend you against a legal assault mounted by the federal state or local judicial systems against your life liberty or happinesscast them aside if you are reading this you are very likely under such assault just know there is only one goal to this assault and that is to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law regardless of guilt or innocence or extenuating circumstance it is their job and they like it and the only thing standing between you and a conviction is your defense attorney upon whom your fate will utterly depend so you had better make the right choice i can personally attest that they don’t come any better than mark bennett period he is the best of the best a lawyer’s lawyer with compassion integrity and a deeply intuitive situational intelligence that enables him to create highly effective strategies and tactics to win your case he can think within the box outside the box and even upend the box if necessarywhatever the situation requires not only does he keep up with the very latest developments in federal state and local legal standards practices and laws his cutting edge commentaries and articles on a wide variety of evolving legal issues help to shape and inform the attitudes and opinions of innumerable practicing lawyers and judges both locally and nationally on at least one occasion while in court he actually had to educate the judge and prosecutor of a change in the law which as a matter of course led to yet another dismissal this is a defense attorney that you want at your sideterry  thweatt pc attorneys at lawkirkbr ratedterry  thweatt is a god sent firm i suffered severe burns to my stomach when i was eating at a fast food restaurant i looked up injury attorneys located in the texas city area and came across terry  thweatt so i called them but was politely informed by irene one of the assistants that their office is located in houston irene continued to get information regarding my injuries and then transferred my call to one of the attorneys joseph terry i was able to get an appointment that same day terry explained the process that we would be involved in and let me know that it can be a long process attorney joseph terry was patient and answered all my questions  all my girlfriend’s questions and concerns i decided to give them a try and man am i glad that i did this firm is by far the most professional and friendly business that i have had to deal with not only are they friendly over the phone but in person too i know that i am not the easiest person to deal with but irene was persistent friendly and professional throughout the whole case unlike other places that are only friendly the first time that you come in to sign the contract i am very happy with the outcome of my case and the services that terry  thweatt provided me with i highly recommend terry  thweatt especially joseph terry to anyone that needs a lawyer for injuries that they suffer because he is so knowledgeable and efficient thank you joseph terry and irenecogdell dansecret n ratedmr akers and the cogdell law firm represented me when i was charged with felony theft i was accused of stealing a bag which contained items belonging to offduty police officers a felony conviction of this nature would have prevented me from practicing my chosen career due to the gravity of the charges against me i knew that i needed immediate proven and effective representation mr akers began gathering information about my case as soon as we ended our telephone conversation and was up to speed for our first meeting he laid out the best case scenario as well as worst case scenario and his recommended plan to resolve the charges against me cordt and his firm kept me appraised to every step that occurred with my case they were able to reschedule hearings for me when i was absolutely unable to travel to harris county for them cordt was available to me whenever i needed to get into contact with him when the prosecution would not budge cordt had informed me that he had already been preparing for trial in case that was the route i chose to take ultimately cordt was able to get the charges against me dismissed for which i am truly grateful requiring a criminal defense attorney means you are already in a stressful and worrying situation i recommend cordt akers to lift some weight off of your shoulders and to guide you through the legal system returning a favorable outcome h brad parker p cn r ratedi hired mr h brad parker seven years ago for bankruptcy and he and his office took the time to understand the specifics of my case the law office of h brad parker helped me save my home from foreclosure and fought the creditors that tried to bring additional financial ruin to me my case was not an easy one and not once did mr parker shun away from the obstacles he was always ready to fight my case and find a way bring justice in fact when my case was discharged some creditors surfaced and tried to falsely collect on a debt once again mr parker was immediately on the case and working toward a favorable result for memr parker went the extra mile for my case he is sincere in his approach and truly cared about the impact of a negative judgment in my case he seeks justice and is concerned about my future as it relates to my case my only regret is that i did not find mr parker years earlier when i needed a family lawyer for any person seeking an honest sincere expert lawyer look no further mr parker’s approach may be different than other lawyers but it is a breath of fresh air you are not a number when a client at h brad parker offices but part of your case legal teammy experience has been so wonderful with the offices of h brad parker that i would not consider hiring any other lawyer in the houston area for my legal needsterry  thweatt pc attorneys at lawrjd ratedi just want to thank the staffi just want to thank the staff and attorneys at the law firm of terry  thweatt pc my wife and i were involved in a personal injury case that required the assistance of legal professional s we retained the services of terry  thweatt via a professional reference we were very pleased with the professionalism and expertise demonstrated by this law firm we were represented by counsel joseph terry the legal assistance provided by mr terry was instrumental in obtaining results that far exceeded our expectations the demeanor and attitude of mr terry and his staff demonstrates that this law firm does what many other law firms repeatedly fail to do put the client’s interest first granted our case did require a little patience but what matters in the end are the results overall the experience that we had with this law firm was a positive and pleasant one it’s difficult to find attorney’s that are honest straightforward and most importantly client service driven the law firm of terry  thweat clearly reflects a client service driven culture therefore i highly recommend this law firm for such legal matters thank you again and keep up the great workrs houston txnossa law office pcdn f ratedresidency my wife stayed in the us on an expired visa when i

another  from larger sum basically lets say i go  and she took her  then i get another  for a total of instead of taking the remaining  from the new money she added it all together and took  from  so

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship

you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off

following abby and john through their struggles was truly sad watching what satan can do to people who get their eyes of jesus long enough not to be able to tell his voice from the enemys was so true to life thankfully it ended well or i would have been very upset and unable to recommend this book its a book every young woman should read even mature teens so you can see the traps that are laid for the happily married by the enemy of our souls very well done i hated putting it down though i would not call it entertaining there were many light moments and wonderful memories from their early years together definitely not suitable for younger teens was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate sandi age  gender female  stars out of  at times it was difficult to read due to packaging july   sandi age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for a time to dance newly repackaged edition  ebook i absolutely loved the book karen kingsbury has got to be one of the most inspirational authors of christian fiction the analogies used prompted me to pray over some of the verses quoted as always ms kingsbury weaves a pageturning story that is not sappy or unbelievable the events of john and abby reynolds and their family are typical of what most families entail as they progress through life though trials from family to family are different they do exist my only issue is that the formatting in the ebook version had an unusual high number of errors i suspect part of the end of the book was missing but since id read the sequel first i wasnt disturbed by that apostrophes were missing and often the letter i was replaced with the letter e it was often enough that i am confident it was not due to a traditional typo these issues are minor in my opinion but worth mentioning im sure that as technology advances so will the quality of the ebook it wont prevent me from downloading other books was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate nichole elmendorf tx age  gender female  stars out of  a great book february   nichole elmendorf tx age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  a beautiful but heartbreaking love story this book helps remind you that with god all things are possible john and abby married for almost  years have drifted apart to the point of divorce the love they had was dying behind fading faith work and every day busy life that they let get between them the battle that rages between satan personal thoughts and gods unwillingness to give up is so powerful i loved this book
