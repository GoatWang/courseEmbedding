incorporated under the law of the state of nevada on july   the company organized to engage in the business of namely the development marketing and delivering of logistical analysis problem solving and other logistics services and general business services the company is currently seeking any business opportunities   on february   michael vardakis the then major shareholder entered into a stock

development to older children and kindergarten classes that will address literacy mathematics and the other early years foundation stage eyfs areas of focus the company will also provide educational consultation services to assist families in placing their children in desirable elementary schools   note  – significant accounting policies   this summary of significant accounting policies of eason education kingdom holdings inc is presented to assist in understanding the companys financial statements the financial statements and notes are representations of the companys management which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents the company currently has cash held in a trust account held by the companys legal counsel   fair value of financial instruments   effective january   the company adopted fasb asc  fair value measurements which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the standard also expands disclosures about instruments measured at fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value   level  – quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets   level  – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets and   level  – valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable        table of contents   the company designates cash equivalents as level  the total amount of the companys investment classified as level  is de minimis   the fair value of the companys debt as of march   and december   approximated fair value at those times   fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated fair value as of march   and december   because of the relative short term nature of these instruments   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition which codified the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab number  which states that revenue is generally recognized when it is realized and earned specifically the company recognizes revenue when services are performed and projects are completed and accepted by the customer   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made however actual results could differ materially from those estimates   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach this process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which would be recorded on the companys balance sheets in accordance with asc  income taxes which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes the company must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely the company must establish a valuation allowance changes in the companys valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the statements of operations   the company records interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statement of income under general and administrative expenses as of march   and december   the company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions the company also did not have any uncertain tax benefits during these years the tax years   and  remain open to examination   earnings loss per share   the company is required to provide basic and dilutive earnings loss per common share information   the basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding   diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders adjusted on an as if converted basis by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities        table of contents   for the period ended march   and year ended december   potential dilutive securities had an antidilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share   recent accounting pronouncements   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “topic  business combinations clarifying the definition of a business” the amendments in this update provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business this screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated the amendments in this update affect all reporting entities that must determine whether they have acquired or sold a business public business entities should apply the amendments in this update to annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those periods all other entities should apply the amendments to annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within annual periods beginning after december   we do not expect the adoption of asu  to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements   from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date if not discussed management believes that the impact of recently issued standards which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the companys financial statements upon adoption management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements when adopted will have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements    note  – going concern   the companys financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the company incurred a net loss of  from operations for the period ended march   and an accumulated deficit of  it also sustained operating losses in prior years as well these factors raise substantial doubt as to its ability to remain a going concern and obtain debt andor equity financing and achieve profitable operations   management intends to raise additional operating funds through equity andor debt offerings however there can be no assurance management will be successful in its endeavors ultimately the company will need to achieve profitable operations in order to continue as a going concern   there are no assurances that eason education kingdom holdings inc will be able to either  achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or  obtain additional financing through either private placement public offerings andor bank financing necessary to support its working capital requirements to the extent that funds generated from operations and any private placements public offerings andor bank financing are insufficient the company will have to raise additional working capital no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or if available will be on terms acceptable to the company if adequate working capital is not available the company may be required to curtail its operations   note  – income taxes   deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment   march     balance     rate     tax   federal loss carryforward                   valuation allowance                       deferred tax asset

valuation allowance               total actual provision               as of march   the company has unutilized tax losses of    deferred tax asset is not provided for as the tax losses may not be able to carry forward after a change in substantial ownership of the company in february  deferred tax asset may also be reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the near future   note  – common stock   as of march   and december   the company authorized two classes of stock  shares of common stock at par value of  and  shares of class a preferred stock at par value of  there are  in march   and december   common shares issued and outstanding none of the class a preferred stock is issued during october  the company issued  shares of common stock for a consideration of  in cash   note  – related party transactions   the company currently utilizes office space on a rentfree basis from a director and shareholder and shall do so until substantial revenueproducing operations commence management deemed the rentfree space to be of no nominal value   as of march   and december   total notes payable to the related parties and accrued interests amounted to  and  in the aggregate   as of december   outstanding balance of  was released by the related parties as of march   and december   the loans from the shareholders were  and    note  – release of liabilities   on february   michael vardakis then majority shareholder entered into a stock purchase agreement with kin hon chu new majority shareholder wherein mr vardakis sold  shares of the companys common stock representing approximately  of all issued and outstanding shares to mr chu mr chu paid  to michael vardakis for this control block of shares and also directly paid off all of the existing liabilities of the company accordingly certain liabilities of  in the aggregate including that related notes payable as disclosed in note  were released by the creditors as a result of the change   note  – subsequent events   the company has evaluated the period after the balance sheet date up through the date that the financial statements were issued and determined that there were no subsequent events or transactions that required recognition or disclosure in the financial statements        table of contents   item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following information should be read in conjunction with i the financial statements of eason education kingdom holdings inc a nevada corporation the company and developmentstage company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form q together with ii the more detailed business information and the december   audited financial statements and related notes included in the companys form k file no  the form k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on march   statements in this section and elsewhere in this form q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute forwardlooking statements   overview   the company was incorporated in the state of nevada on july   and established a fiscal year end of december  it is a development stage company   going concern   to date the company has little operations or revenues and consequently has incurred recurring losses from operations no revenues are anticipated until we complete the financing we endeavor to obtain as described in the form k and implement our initial business plan the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations accordingly these factors raise substantial doubt as to the companys ability to continue as a going concern   our activities have been financed from relatedparty loans and the proceeds of share subscriptions from our inception to march   we have made a total of  amount due to shareholder which carried no interest had no collateral and repayable on demand during october  the company raised a total of  in cash from offerings of our common stock   the company plans to raise additional funds through debt or equity offerings there is no guarantee that the company will be able to raise any capital through this or any other offerings   plan of operation   our business activities during the coming  months following the filing date of this form k will be focused on raising  of funds to expand our business primarily through the sale of shares of common stock registered in a public offering on form s registration no  which registration statement was declared effect by the securities and exchange commission on may   we have no assurance that future financing will materialize if that financing is not available we may be unable to continue management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof however additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements   if we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because we are a development stage company with no operations to date it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment        table of contents   results of operations   threemonth periods ended march   and    we did not earn revenues for the periods ended march   and    for the period ended march

liquidity and capital resources   at march   we had a cash balance of  total current assets  total current liabilities of approximately  working capital and stockholders equity of approximately  we do not have sufficient cash on hand to commence our month plan of operation or to fund our ongoing operational expenses we will need to raise funds to commence our plan of operation and fund our ongoing operational expenses additional funding will likely come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or debt securities if we are successful in completing an equity or debt financing existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our company we do not have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or debt securities to fund our planned activities and ongoing operational expenses in the absence of such financing our business will likely fail there are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing if we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations then we will not be able to continue our operations and our business will fail   offbalance sheet arrangements   we had no offbalance sheet arrangements for the three months ended

act we are not required to provide the information called for by this item         table of contents   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures our management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions   based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of march   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules regulations and forms and ii that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   changes in internal control over financial reporting   our management with the participation of the
