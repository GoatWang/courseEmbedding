took cooper peg oconnor decades to learn what his father had been faithfully demonstrating for years when you play a songyoure giving them something that no amount of money can buy       hope his journey took him from the mountains of colorado and a life filled with tent revivals to the street corners of nashville tennessee where lots of people could play an instrument but seldom offered the gift of music until cooper meets daley cross the voice that his prodigious fingers were meant to play and then he understood albeit too late this side of eternity years of regret and a sizable bank account could not replace what cooper had long way gone he could only chose to live the extended life that he had been given ultimately discovering that the god who had waited patiently every step of the way could take his heart and seal it offering him unconditional love for the prodigal had come all the way home this is kind of book that the more times it is read will delve its melody deeper

this review was written for long way gone really enjoyed this read the writing style is so different and the storyline is incredibly well done giving this five stars because it touched my heart and brought a tear or two very few books do that the characters seem so real and the plot  though not original is so very touching this was my first by this author but i dont expect it will be my last

everything of value from his father expecting that he will make it big there and be able to return after having proved himself the years pass and he never sees his father again but carries the lessons his father taught him in his heart years after a devastating tragedy cooper meets up with his longlost love and wants to make amends but doubts that she will believe the truth he must decide if his love for her is worth the risk of rejection yet again charles martin weaves a beautiful tale of love and second chances set to lyrical prose it gives the reader hope that reconciliation and gods purposes are being worked even in difficult relationships i loved this book its characters story line plot twists and the satisfying conclusion i received a free copy from the publisher for my honest opinion was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate michelle k  stars out of  unexpectedly good february   michelle k quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for long way gone this book was such a pleasant surprise martin is a newtome author so i wasnt sure what to expect but i was completely drawn into the story packed full of emotion this modern day prodigal son story really tugs at the heartstrings plot cooper oconnor grew up in the shadow of his father a tent revival preacher at eighteen following an argument with his father cooper steals his favorite guitar and money  taking off for nashville in search of his big break things dont go as planned but his pride wont let cooper go crawling back to his father as he gradually scrapes his way to the top he meets daley cross an amazingly talented singer cooper shares a song he wrote with daley which turns into a big hit tragedy strikes ruining coopers chances to win daleys heart and the two go their separate ways many years later theyre reunited when cooper returns home but it may be too late for him to reconcile the storys told through coopers point of view i enjoyed how it was divided into parts telling both the past and the present so the reader learns all about the events that have shaped coopers life as a music lover i really enjoyed the in depth look at some music history and how about that gorgeous cover i love the subtle way they made the road and guitar blend together recommendation id highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys christian fiction with a great message of hope and redemption i found it comparable to nicholas sparks id suggest making sure you have plenty of tissues handy as youll probably need them several times i will definitely be looking to read more books from this author rating  stars i received a copy of this book from the thomas nelson fiction guild this review is my honest opinion was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate magister michigan age  gender female  stars out of  modern prodigal comes home february   magister michigan age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for long way gone this was an engrossing book  the same day i finished it i found myself going back and rereading it just to get every nuance it was the first book id read by charles martin but it certainly wont be the last that said i was a little uncomfortable with the supernatural parts of the book they reminded me of frank perettis style which im not sure is entirely supported by the bible it seems to me that that aspect of the story could have been omitted without damaging coopers journey loved the main characters in this book  cooper oconner peg and his musical talent eclipsed only by his brutal honesty and openhanded generosity martin did an excellent job making this man believable at each stage of his life and daley cross was so winsome  bold and fragile at the same time though am i the only one who wondered at how easily she seemed to trade love for loyalty the chemistry between these two musicians was fantastic supporting players like pegs father and bigbig were touching and realistic each person in this book deals with pain and loss that would be crushing if not redeemed for a higher purpose i was encouraged by the faith they exercised in so many twists and turns what confidence in the power of love one of my disappointments in many books is the author not knowing when to quit martin masterfully avoids this in his satisfying epilogue and the evangelistic pages that follow his personal presentation of the good news that restored peg is clear and sound i will enjoy sharing this book with friendsafter i finish my second reading of it i
