mays  wikipedia jw mays from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search jw mays inc nasdaq mays is a real estate firm based in brooklyn new york united states from  until  the company ran a chain of discount department stores in the area surrounding new york city referred to as mays with stores located in three of new york citys five boroughs long island and putnam county at its height as a retailer the firm had  employees working in  stores during the early s historyedit the chain grew from a brooklyn womens clothing store founded by joe weinstein a polish jewish immigrant from galicia in  in  weinstein incorporated the company and added his initials the reason why he chose the name to begin with was because as weinstein said it reminded me of the countryside and the flowers and the springtime mays grew throughout the s and s its slogan every days a sale day at mays was imprinted in big red script lettering on every white paper shopping bag and every white cardboard shopping box mondays were supersales days and stores were especially crowded then weinstein was aggressive in his competition against other discount retailers such as ohrbachs and alexanders as well as the higherend department stores at one point weinstein discussed a merger between mays and his two main discount competitors but it never came to be at the companys peak in the s mays operated nine stores at that time the company had about  employees by the late s it started losing market share to other discount retailers and in  the store declared chapter  bankruptcy the company closed five locations that operated outside the city leaving one store in manhattan two stores in queens and the original store in brooklyn in  mays closed one of its two stores in queens glen oaks leaving three in the chain the chain continued on but announced on december   that they would be closing the remaining three stores in the chain immediately with the final sale occurring on december  of that year beginning on january   jw mays inc reincorporated as the real estate company that currently does business using the real estate that its stores had previously occupied referencesedit
