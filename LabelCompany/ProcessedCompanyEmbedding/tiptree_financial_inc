company had net income before taxes from continuing operations of  million for the three months ended march   which was an increase of  million from the three months ended march   the key drivers of pretax results from continuing operations were improved revenues and investment income from our insurance and insurance services segment increased rental income in our senior housing real estate operations and unrealized gains on principal investments partially offset by increased expenses in specialty finance and higher corporate expenses associated with our effort to improve our controls and financial reporting infrastructure for the three months ended march   the company reported revenues of  million an increase of  million from the three months ended march   the primary drivers of the increase in revenues were periodoverperiod improvements in earned premiums service and administrative fees and investment income in our insurance and insurance services segment the acquisition of reliance in specialty finance and of senior housing properties at care and improvement in the performance of our principal investments for the three months ended march   the company had expenses of  million an increase of  million from the three months ended march   the primary drivers of the increase in expenses were commission expenses in insurance and insurance services as a result of the growth in written premiums higher payroll and commission expense primarily related to the addition of reliance volume and an increase in headcount in specialty finance increased operating expenses and depreciation and amortization associated with our increased investments in our real estate segment and increases in corporate payroll and professional expenses to improve our reporting and controls infrastructure for the three months ended march   the company reported adjusted ebitda from continuing operations of  million an increase of  million from the three months ended march   the key drivers of the change in adjusted ebitda were the same as those which impacted our pretax income from continuing operations the company reported total adjusted ebitda for the three months ended march   of  million an increase of  million from the three months ended march   the primary drivers of the increase were the same factors that impacted adjusted ebitda from continuing operations partially offset by the loss of income from discontinued operations from  management believes that adjusted ebitda provides a supplementary metric to enhance investors’ understanding of the ongoing earnings potential of the company’s businesses and an indication of the company’s ability to generate additional funds for reinvestment in the combined businesses because it is a nongaap measure it should be reviewed in conjunction with the company’s gaap results see “nongaap financial measures  ebitda and adjusted ebitda” below for further information relating to the company’s adjusted ebitda measure including a reconciliation to gaap net income segment results insurance and insurance services segment the company’s insurance and insurance services segment is comprised of its whollyowned fortegra subsidiary which was acquired in december  the acquisition of fortegra resulted in purchase price accounting adjustments in our insurance and insurance services segment giving effect to the pushdown accounting treatment of the acquisition these adjustments include setting deferred cost assets to a fair value of zero modifying deferred revenue liabilities to their respective fair values and recording a substantial intangible asset representing the value of the business acquired “voba” the application of pushdown accounting creates a modest impact to net income but significantly impacts individual assets liabilities revenues and expenses due to acquisition accounting the line items through which revenue and expenses relate to acquired contracts are recognized in a single line item depreciation and amortization and are different than newly originated contracts to allow for better periodoverperiod comparison of operations we eliminated the effects of purchase accounting as adjusted the company believes that as adjusted information provides useful supplemental information to investors but should be reviewed in conjunction with their nearest gaap equivalent see “nongaap financial measures  fortegra” below for further information including a reconciliation from gaap results to as adjusted results insurance and insurance services segment pretax income was  million in the three months ended march   an increase of  million or  over the prior year period operating results the primary drivers of the improvement in periodoverperiod results was a reduction in total operating expenses of  million primarily in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the voba partially offset by a reductions in net revenues of  million driven by competition in the warranty segment as adjusted pretax income was  million for the three months ended march   an increase of  million or  the primary drivers of the periodoverperiod improvement include an increase in net revenues of  million driven by improvements in credit protection investment income earned premiums and service fees as adjusted operating expenses were down  million as a result of cost actions taken throughout  to reduce headcount and professional fees for insurance and insurance services the main components of revenue are service and administrative fees ceding commissions and earned premiums net total revenues were  million for the three months ended march   up  million or  over the prior year period the increase was primarily driven by an increase in earned premiums of  million or  and increase of  million or  in service and administrative fees and an increase of  million in investment income all of which were slightly offset by a decrease of  million in periodoverperiod impacts of purchase accounting as adjusted net revenues were  million for the three months ended march   up  million or  from the comparable  period the increase was primarily driven by improvements in the credit protection and specialty products as reduced claim activity and investment income on float drove the yearoveryear favorability those improvements were dampened slightly by a reduction in periodoverperiod as adjusted net revenues for cell phone warranty contracts as competitive pressures remain operating expenses in the insurance and insurance services segment are composed of payroll and employee commissions interest expense professional fees depreciation and amortization expenses and other expenses segment operating expenses in the three months ended march   were  million a decrease of  million or  as compared to the previous year period costs the primary driver of the periodoverperiod decrease was attributable to lower depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the decline in purchase accounting impact from the amortization of the fair value attributed to the insurance policies and contracts acquired which was  million for the three months ended march   versus  million in the comparable  period as adjusted operating expenses of  million were down periodoverperiod as a result of continued cost reduction efforts insurance and insurance services segment adjusted ebitda was  million for the three months ended march   an increase of  million for the same period yearoveryear the key drivers of adjusted ebitda growth was higher credit insurance and specialty products revenues and flat operating expenses adjusted for the impact of purchase accounting effects partially offset by lower warranty revenues driven by competition in the cell phone warranty business see “nongaap financial measures  ebitda and adjusted ebitda” below for a reconciliation to gaap net income specialty finance segment specialty finance segment pretax loss was  million for three months ended march   compared with pretax income of  million for the same period in  the key driver of the decrease was higher expense growth relative to volume growth caused by investment in marketing expenses and costs of additional sales personnel growth in volume tends to lag the hiring of new loan officers as the full ramp up of productivity takes four to six months segment revenues were  million for the three months ended march   compared with  million for the comparable  period an increase of  million or  segment expenses were  million in the three months ended march   compared with  million in the comparable  period an increase of  million or  higher expenses more than offset higher revenues resulting in declining profitability yearoveryear primarily drivers include unfavorable market conditions which dampened organic origination growth excluding the impact of the reliance acquisition increasing payroll expenses as the businesses expand headcount to produce future originations and increased professional expenses for audit and internal control over financial reporting specialty finance segment adjusted ebitda was a loss of  million for the three months ended march   compared to income of  million in the prior year period the decline in adjusted ebitda was driven by the increased expenses which more than offset increases in volume and

asset management segment was  million for three months ended march   compared with pretax net income of  million for the prior year period a decrease of  million the key drivers of decline were a reduction in management fees by  million offset by an increase an increase in other income of  million and further reduced by an increase of payroll and employee commissions of  million the reduction in management fees was driven by a combination of aum declines in our older clos which are past their reinvestment periods and lower fees as described below the other income was a gain on extinguishment of an obligation to share future management fees for an amount that was significantly below its carrying value asset management segment adjusted ebitda was  million for  compared to

income attributable to clos managed by the company including the net income from our deconsolidated clos pretax income from the company’s clo business was  million for the three months ended march   compared with pretax income of  million in  the primary driver of the yearoveryear increase of  million was lower realized and unrealized losses incurred on the company’s holdings of subordinated

period plus the impact of lower fees on later clos the lower distributions from the subordinated notes in  compared to the prior year is primarily due to our sales of clo subordinated notes during the second quarter of  the realized and unrealized losses in the three months ended march   and march   were due to the marktomarket writedown in our retained clo subordinated note holdings see “nongaap

derivative risk mitigation transactions segment expenses include interest expense on the fortress credit facility and head office payroll and other expenses pretax loss from the corporate and other segment for the three months ended march   was  million compared to  million in the prior year period the primary drivers of this difference is the result of a pretax gain of  million in our credit investments consisting primarily of interest income from our telos  warehouse and our credit opportunities fund which were not formed in the prior year period as well as a  million unrealized gains on

supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period to analyze a company’s ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies the company believes segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments adjusted ebitda is also used in determining incentive compensation for the company’s executive officers these measures are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for net income the company’s presentation of these measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures used by other companies the company defines ebitda as gaap net income of the company adjusted to add consolidated interest expense consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense as presented in its financial statements and adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted to i subtract interest expense on assetspecific debt incurred in the ordinary course of its subsidiaries’ business operations ii adjust for the effect of

adjusted ebitda management uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda which are nongaap financial measures the company believes that use of these financial measures on a consolidated basis and for each segment provide supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period to analyze a companys ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparison among companies the company believes segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments adjusted ebitda is also used in determining incentive compensation for the companys executive officers these measures are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for net income the companys presentation of these measures may differ from similarly titled nongaap financial measures used by other companies the company defines ebitda as gaap net income of the company adjusted to add consolidated interest expense consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization expense as presented in its financial statements and adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted to i subtract interest expense on assetspecific debt incurred in the ordinary course of its subsidiaries business operations ii adjust for the effect

period expenses associated with deferred costs were more favorably stated by  million and current period income associated with deferred revenues were less favorably stated by  million thus the purchase accounting effect related to fortegra increased ebitda in the first quarter of  by  million above what the historical basis of accounting would have generated the impact of this purchase accounting adjustments have been reversed to reflect an adjusted ebitda without such purchase accounting effect    for care adjusted ebitda excludes the impact of the change of fair value of interest

purchase price accounting which management believes provides for better periodoverperiod comparison of the underlying operating performance of the business and aligns more closely with the basis upon which management performance is measured due to acquisition accounting the line items through which revenue and expenses relate to acquired contracts are recognized in a single line item depreciation and amortization and are different than newly originated contracts to allow for better periodoverperiod comparison of operations we eliminated the effects of purchase accounting the company believes that as adjusted information provides useful supplemental information to investors but should be reviewed in conjunction with their nearest gaap equivalent investors should not consider these nongaap financial measures as a substitute for the financial information that fortegra reports in accordance with us gaap these nongaap financial measures reflect subjective determinations by fortegra
