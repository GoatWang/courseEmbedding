casestheyre flexible and individualized with premature ovarian failure all the statistics said that i had literally zero chance of conceiving a child with my own eggs even with the best fertility treatments most clinics said they could only help me if i were willing to use donor eggs but dr turkaspa was willing to try with my own eggs after i failed to respond to even the most aggressive standard protocol he devised an experimental treatment for me based on some recent studies the result were currently pregnant with fraternal twins with a third perfect embryo frozen for future use even he seemed a little amazed at the results turkaspa ilan mdmaureen rateddr turkaspa is the best in hdr turkaspa is the best in his field i went to him after  failed ivfs from a previous doctor he took the time with me to answer all my questions and concerns his staff is also courteous and kind and was always there to answer any questions or concerns at my second appointment he found polyps in my uterine lining that were missed by the previous doctor we then did ivf with icsi and assisted hatching and i am now in my th week of pregnancy im over the moon and so grateful to dr turkaspa and his staff for helping me make my dreams come true pregnant at  i couldnt ask for anything more im so thankful to them and would reccomend him to anyone struggling with infertilityturkaspa ilan mdannask ratedi went through  failed ivf cycles and also we had very few embryos  ready for transfer i was recommended to meet dr turkaspahe went through all the medical documentation that i brought with me and suggested a different protocol i went through  cycles but the first was without a transfer intentionally we had   embryos and bottom line  i am  months pregnant i am aware of that sometimes dr turkaspa has a cynical and non graceful attitude but all in all i feel that hes super professional and the best doctor that ever treated me hes a good listener and also he has an outstanding out of the box way of thinkingdr anil r shah mdaleksandra k ratedstarting off i want to say that the staff here is beyond welcoming and helpful dr anil shah himself has a warm yet confident and at the same time caring personality which made me trust him from the beginning over other doctors i have seen after my surgery it was extremely easy for me to transition into my new nose because the change was so subtle and non invasive recovery for me was a walk in a park as well and that was my biggest fear going into this overall from beginning till now i feel great about my decision and i feel deep in my heart it is thanks to dr shah and his caring staffharmony medical  wellness centerpatientmary rateddr james mo excellent family ddr james mo excellent family doctori would highly recommend dr mo to everyone dr mo is a caring and very knowledgeable family physician he and his office staff are very friendly my entire family has been seeing dr mo for many years and very satisfied with him he listens to what you have to say and cares deeply about your condition he spends a lot of time with us and you dont find a lot of doctors that are willing to do that nowadays his diagnosis is always very accurate we have high level of trust in him dr mo also does immigration exams and physical therapy which are awesomedr anil r shah mdk f ratedsaw dr shah for a rhinoplasty best decision i ever made i am now  months post op and could not be happier with the results dr shah is an excellent skilled surgeonreally an artist he also has a very friendly and approachable bedside manner his staff is always super helpful appointments are always on time which is so rare with doctors these days if you are considering rhinoplasty dr shah is the best i already referred a friend for a rhinoplasty with dr shah his surgery was last week and also had nothing but the best things to say about dr shahdr anil r shah mdk r rateddrshah turned my vision for my rhinoplasty into a reality i am so happy with the results i do however wish that he had been able to articulate to me a little more how the procedure went what was done and that i had stitches still in my nose after the one week follow up where the black stitches were removed i did not know the blue stitches were in there and pulled them out on accident thinking it was a hair or something because the swelling had covered them overall though very happy i did the procedure and think that drshah did a beautiful jobdr anil r shah mdwaylon f ratedi had a great experience with dr shah i was a bit nervous at first because i have never had surgery and did not know what to expect his staff was very comforting throughout the entire process and answered all of my questions what i found amazing was that after the removal of a lipoma from my forehead i did not feel any pain only pressure throughout the healing process best of all i do not have a visible scar since he went through my hair line i also did not have to shave any portion of my head i could not be any happier waylon fdid you knowphysicians and surgeons help to keep people  from infants to the elderly  as healthy as possible these individuals

a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your
