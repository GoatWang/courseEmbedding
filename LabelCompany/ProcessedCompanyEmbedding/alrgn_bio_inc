alrgn bio and based in manhattan enlarge alrgn bio is a greensboro company working on a technology that reduces allergens within… more its the leading cause of anaphylactic food related deaths mcquiston said mcquiston told triad business journal that alrgn bio hopes to eventually commercialize its technology which could be licensed by food manufacturers and food companies that in turn would create a safer peanut for everything from a snack served to airplane passengers and a peanut butter used in schools to a breakfast bar and a weightlifting powder people who normally eat peanuts now wouldnt care but the restaurant owner would be happier because his liability just dropped significantly mcquiston said i would imagine that large companies would find this helpful as sort of a brand extension or really the creation of a new food category a small portion of the  worth of funding will go to sponsored research at nc at and the compensation of jianmei yu a phd research scientist at nc at whose work on peanut allergen reduction resulted in a patent that was licensed to alrgn bio for commercialization alrgn bios testing thus far has shown that the technology has dramatically reduced —in some cases  percent plus — the proteins that humans are allergic to in peanuts he said the technology involves a process of taking peanuts and placing them in a large hot bath of water with some food enzymes which break down the proteins alrgn bio will focus on additional research at uncchapel hill where the company plans to conduct tests on mice which have been sensitized to simulate how a child with peanut allergies would react to the proteins after that it goes to human oral challenge and then we will be able to license it to food companies mcquiston said mcquiston said the company was founded about three years ago he got involved two years ago because his daughter is allergic to peanuts he is not taking a salary for his job as ceo our focus is to keep the burn rate low and placing all the resources in proving out the technology he said the company was recently featured in a new york times story titled is it possible to make a less allergenic peanut katie arcieri

back in all of the pigsmashing splendor and ready to make you rush into the new adventure read more angry birds  delivers a follow up that beats all the predecessors and brings the series the past glory it’s back in all of the pigsmashing splendor and ready to make you rush into the new adventure graphics  the graphics in angry birds  are greatly improved the game is lavishly colored beautifully polished and with detailed and lively animation backgrounds are richer in detail explosions are bigger and the characters are much more emotive especially with a pictureinpicture closeups which show the bird grimacing in anger and the pigs quivering in fear angry birds  provides you with a great threedimensional experience as the good flings can result in both pigs and debris flying directly at the screen gameplay  angry birds  is very similar to what we have seen before in the series the green pigs are back at talking your eggs and your goal is to rescue these unborn birds by flinging fowl at annoying swine and their unsteady structures you will have a score based on your performance which also determines how many stars you receive at the end of the level as it was in the previous iteration each bird comes with the specific abilities triggered by tapping on the screen in midflight the red bird sends a blow to everything in front of it the yellow one can fly faster the white one throws an egg bomb the smaller blue bird splits into three and the new gray character flies straight down and smashes the opponents controls  if you lived under a rock or just stepped out of a time machine you would surely need the control tips but anyway we are going to remind you birds get revenge on the pigs by loading themselves into slingshots and flinging into the structures pigs hang out in once you popped all the pigs you proceed to the next level and do it again replay value  angry birds  has  stages to play so that you won’t run out of fun besides there is also a new feature called arena which allows you to play for as long as your birds will last you then you can compare high scores with your friends and see who is the true master of the perch this time rovio brings a randomization to the levels as the starting arrangement of the structures pigs and birds will change with each retry thus the same level will look differently every time you load it this feature has a drastic impact on the way you play as you won’t be able to watch the video tutorial if you get stuck now you’re forced to think over the level from scratch inapp purchases angry birds  doesn’t ask for onetime payment or make the game free with ads instead rovio decided to take advantage of the ingame currency system the game uses gems which can quickly become necessary as the levels get more difficult if you don’t finish your levels successfully you run out of lives and at some point without enough gems you will have to wait  minutes to keep playing thus to get more lives immediately or repeat the lost game you’ll need to buy gems for actual money the flow of free gems slows down after some time so you will have to accomplish objectives complete daily challenges and watch ads to get them with no charge conclusion angry birds  lives up to its billing as a numerical sequel and despite limited lives it won’t disappoint the gamers with polishedup graphics and the new challenges it has to offer rovio has done a good job to make angry birds  the best entry in the series so far collapse conclusion the enhanced graphics new challenges and finessed gameplay bring you plenty of reasons to put all your eggs in angry birds s basket pros  great visuals evolving levels  stages cons  paid life system graphics  gameplay  controls  replay value  average   here you can

been timetried long enough this game can be referred to as mobile rts classics this definition often means that the game cannot attract new fans and keeps up due to the old loyal audience but clash of clans is not the case the game was launched in august  for ios devices and in october  for android even if you have never played it actually you might have seen its aggressive ads within different apps now it’s stable and each coc update only brings bug fixes still it doesn’t take everyday innovations to attract about  million users graphics  any clash of clans review should start with praising its graphics the developers have made it rich and spectacular but action scenes don’t turn to the usual mayhem we see in mobile strategies the buildings and the units are easy to distinguish the text part is well readable and pictograms are easy to remember and tap when necessary the app looks great both on phone screens and on tablets though if you own both we’d recommend using the tablet full hd or qhd screens bring you the pleasure of making out the game details but even usual hd screens we see in cheaper devices are able to retranslate what clash of clans looks like another difference is made by forced screen mode portrait on smartphones and landscape on tablets in fact the experience on android and ios devices is virtually the same unless youre using an android device with obsolete hardware though older versions of clash of clans apps are still available through thirdparty sites stable work is not granted gameplay  like in most strategy games in clash of clans you have to rule your kingdom and upgrade its industry its agriculture and its army the further you go the more powerful enemies you have to fight and the harder tasks to fulfill you run into there are three kinds of resources in this game gold elixir and crystals while the first two is renewable and producible crystals only can be received as rewards for your achievements rare enough or bought in the game store the resources are complementary it takes elixir to upgrade your gold mines and gold to accelerate elixir production the army is produced in barracks and stored in army camps defining the maximum capacity  the more camps you have and the more advanced they are the more troops you can send against your enemy war is necessary as necessary are the trophies you’ll have to wait too long until you mine enough gold to upgrade your town hall even to level  military part is made simple enough yet it takes some good reaction and calculation select the place for your troops to land outside the red line bordering the enemy camp and watch them attack the closest targets their behavior is sometimes illogical for example troops attack and crash the walls to get to the target directly instead of passing it even if it saves time just accept it as a feature you can attack both trolls led by ai or real players in pvp mode remember its an open world so you can be the attacker as well as the target new users get a day protection that makes them invisible to others but as it expires other players become able to attack you so take care of your protection and build some defensive forces like cannons archer towers and don’t neglect walls and bombs if you don’t intend to spend real money on green stones you’d better spend it on an external battery to accelerate the processes you’ll have to use many crystals and if you choose not to accelerate you’ll have to wait while the time ticks in the background though the app doesn’t have to run in the foreground unlike pokémon go it will notify you about its processes though coc download is free and so is the gameplay you’ll have to purchase crystals if you want to succeed in your ruling there’s no way to cheat though clash of clans cheats are promoted on many sites all these efforts are blocked on the server side by the way didn’t we mention that the game requires an active internet connection controls  like in good old pc strategies you don’t have to master strange moves or commands touchscreens do not allow grabbing a group of units by a frame but you don’t have to at all you have a great lot of buttons instead leaving no option in most situation collect elixir or gold produce troops send them to fight the enemy build a new gold mine or elixir storage you’ll have no place to mistap the game doesn’t force you to the only right way but you can only make strategical mistakes not gaming errors a little pleasant thing is layout editor that allows you editing your layouts and thus change your gaming experience replay value  yes you can start your promotion right from the beginning by starting a new game but tell me with your right hand on sid meier’s civilization will you as your progress is constantly saved in the cloud and bound to your googleapple account you don’t have to start it from the very beginning the space to progress ahead is unlimited the only reason to start the game again is your decision to quit it and pass your device with your account to someone else but look if you present or sell your smartphone or tablet to someone they certainly will reset it with their own accounts and start their own game right so we imagine no practical need to replay clash of clans anew the bottom line the game seems one of the best in its category brilliant graphics advanced social part multilingual interface large tech tree and other features of a good strategy game are all here collapse conclusion if you need a part of your life you’ll give an hour or two daily at least clash of clans is a good choice with good graphics exciting gameplay and a great chance to test yourself in virtual battles pros  detailed and easy to master graphics advanced social features interface designed for touchscreen devices layout editor cons  the game forces you to donate via your social environment it really involves and steals your time poor replayability useless while offline graphics  gameplay  controls  replay

mobile users for anyone looking to try out the new pokemon go game you might find this page useful were going to break down the overall quality of the pokemon go app so that you can see if its worth your time or not hopefully this can help you decide whether you want to get involved or not functionality –  the functionality of the app is simple – go and catch pokemon youll follow a range of different features across the map until you come across the pokemon you want to catch since you need to use the real world around you the functionality has been made to be as perfect as possible now you should have no problems linking up your phone with the app since it tracks things even for the smallest and most remote of towns pokemon go has wonderful functionality its easy to use and offers simple management of its various features and addons design –  the design of the layout is nice and simple too whilst it might not accurately portray the exact roads of your location meaning you need to know where youre walking it offers lots of great extra for example the design makes it easy to get to all of the various features and to see what is going on around you with clear indicators of stopping points and gyms youll have no problem finding your friends for a quick chat trade and battle the design is excellent and really makes buying into the world around you a fair bit easier usability –  using the app is quite simple too whilst it will take a few days of looking in each menu and getting to use with the context of everything you are being asked its certainly not impossible therefore the usability of this app is more or less where i was hoping that it would be its easy to control and get around the menus and the offers you need are just what you expect to see this ensures that in time youll start to see impressive new features and not have a problem using them such is the ease of use the usability is set to improve when new extras are added crossplatform usage –  this works across other platforms yes this makes it nice and easy to manage your pokemon as you would have hoped for and expected and also ensures you can work with your mates and other trainers no matter what system they are using inapp purchases you can purchase certain addons from inside the pokemon go app such as lure sets lure sets are used to make it easier to find pokemon in your area but they will cost you a few dollars to buy for those who live in rural areas with not much activity or for those constrained by time and location these are excellent solutions not only will this help you catch the kind of pokemon that you were hoping for itll make it so much quicker to hunt down appreciate and fully diversify the pokemon that you are going to be running around with if you find that minimal amounts and similar styles of pokemon continue to appear this might help you avoid that problem altogether with the inapp purchases you can make it quite easy to manage the world around you as you see fit the bottom line to conclude pokemon go looks to be everything people are talking about lots might be put off by the fact you need to be outside and it could become quite timeaddictive but it is a lot of fun to play not only will you find that the numerous pokemon and pokemonrelated features are cool but it makes a whole new style of the mobile game come to life this is quite a unique approach and given the size of the label it is attached to pokemon it really is no surprise that this has exploded into such a vibrant program if you want something fun and exciting that ensures you can begin to get to grips with the world of pokemon accordingly this is definitely worth your time trying it out it adds fun and flavor to your smartphone and helps people make gaming a bit more social and adventurous than before pokemon go pushes a strong social function onto the gaming and makes it easier for people to get out and have fun the game is deeply addictive and makes it easier than ever for players to engage with their local surroundings with hot spots in every town that pokemon go works in youll find it easier than ever to have a new activity to enjoy taking part in collapse conclusion pokemon go is a deeply satisfying product that tied up social engagement with major franchises the ease of walking around and getting fit as you go makes pokemon go an easy product to turn around and enjoy using in the future for all its easy to understand and appreciate though this means for casual gamers without much time flexibility this one might be a toughie to get used to playing on a regular basis pros  easy to get into and a whole lot of fun suitable for nostalgic or children who are just getting into pokemon provides only the classic pokemon saving it from feeling oversaturated more or less impossible to finish – will take you longer than the servers are likely to be up for cons  deeply addictive one of the hardest games out there to put down a little

this has been created for mobile games and the classic the sims gameplay has been redesigned to suit mobile devices players create and care for their sims as they go through life and age this free to play game uses realtime to dictate the actions of sims and the player needs to issue all instructions to their sims read more the sims freeplay is a life simulation game from the popular the sims series unlike the other games in this series this has been created for mobile games and the classic the sims gameplay has been redesigned to suit mobile devices players create and care for their sims as they go through life and age this free to play game uses realtime to dictate the actions of sims and the player needs to issue all instructions to their sims graphics  despite being a mobile game it has brilliant graphics that are close to the quality seen in the main games it looks more like a topdown game however this is not the case as the camera can easily be zoomed in and panned around the house everything in the game looks fantastic on mobile devices and follows the classic sims graphics seen in the other games not only does sims freeplay work incredibly well on mobile devices its almost perfectly brought a free version of the sims to mobiles this is a great way to experience the sims while away from a pc or console however it does have some downsides while the game does feature a cash store theres no need to ever actually buy anything all gameplay impacting items that can be bought in the cash store can also be purchased with ingame money the only downside to this however is the fact that it takes much longer to purchase these items and the player will need to do quite a bit of grinding the only items in the cash store that can not be purchased anywhere else are clothing items these are not needed to progress through the game and the free store already offers quite a lot of options to select from the game uses realtime for everything and waiting for long periods at a time can be very annoying as the game progresses more sims are unlocked which helps with this issue slightly the biggest annoyance due to this however is the fact that the game is constantly running the sims are always waiting for the player to command them and will not do anything for themselves it gives the player more responsibilities about making sure they go to work on time and that they have their basic needs met gameplay  the game features a good tutorial at the start of the game to introduce the player to the mobile orientated game mechanics and controls its relatively simple with the classic pinching to zoom and pivoting to move the camera angle the game features a clear ui that is easy to understand and use which allows for a smooth gaming experience while the game doesnt feature the same high levels of customization seen in the main games it does have high customization for a mobile game players can design and customize their own sim from a range of preselected faces and various other physical attributes in addition to this theres a wide range of clothing items to select and most are available for free more customization items are unlocked over time as the player levels up however there are also items which can be bought with the games premium currency being a game in the sims series means that the player can also construct and fully customize houses to their own design there is a large range of items and furniture which can be bought and placed anywhere inside of the various houses in the game building the house is similar to the main games the player can adjust room size and also more intricate details such as flooring controls  controlling the sims is pretty simple they can be directed to walk to specific locations and to do certain actions by tapping it works in a similar way to the main games and the control mechanics have been nicely transferred to mobile devices just like with the main games sims in this game have specific needs that must be filled to keep them happy and alive however sims do not have any individual interests skills or desires which means the player can have them do anything without consequences they can also be given a variety of jobs which each starts at different times the player needs to manually get them ready for work and then send them to work as the game progresses more workplaces and shops can be built around town this costs simoleons and lifestyle points however sims can form friendships and romantic relationships with other sims in the town they can marry move in together have sex and have children just like in the main games any children a couple has are also customizable and fully controllable by the player its not just positive relationships sims can form they can become enemies and hate each other which can cause them to physically fight when provoked replay value  the game is played entirely in realtime every action a sim takes exactly the same length in realtime this includes when the player sends their sim to sleep when one sim is sleeping another one may still active for the player to control and play with the main sims games feature a fastforward mechanic to skip long actions such as going to work however this game doesnt include this feature as the player levels up more of the game unlocks including the ability to have more sims a total of  sims are unlocked across the game and each one is completely controllable by the player there is no autonomy in the game and sims will not do anything unless they are instructed to do so by the player the game is also constantly running when the player is away from the game this means that sims will not care for themselves in any way and can potentially die if left alone for too long inapp purchases   verdict the sims freeplay is a freetoplay mobile game from the popular sims series it follows the iconic gameplay seen in the life simulation series where the player creates and cares for their sims ea has released several mobile titles in the sims series and freeplay is potentially the best one from the group for a multitude of reasons collapse conclusion sims freeplay brings the best of the sims to mobiles but it does fall victim to the most frustrating feature seen in most mobile games the focus on realtime for completing actions pros  lots of customization can have children classic sims gameplay cons  expensive ingame items long wait times forced to build houses large download graphics  gameplay  controls  replay value  average   here you can find the links
