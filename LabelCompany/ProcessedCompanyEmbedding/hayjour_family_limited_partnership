it save your family money flp what is a family limited partnership and how can it save your family money by stephanie morrow college professor flp what is a family limited partnership and how can it save your family money by stephanie morrow august  some of the hardest decisions a family can make are how to handle money property and other family investments an answer to these difficult questions especially for families with considerable real estate holdings is establishing a family limited partnership flp when used properly an flp can be very profitable and save families thousands of dollars in gift and estate taxes flps provide both protection from creditors and flexibility not found in other trusts as it can be amended or changed what is an flp an flp is a limited partnership controlled by members of a family like other limited partnerships an flp consists of two types of partners general and limited general partners control all management and investment decisions and bear  of the liability limited partners cannot participate in the management of the flp and have limited liability the partnership itself isnt taxable  instead the owners of a partnership report the partnerships income and deductions on their personal tax return in proportion to their interests in an flp generally the senior family members parents or grandparents contribute assets in exchange for a small general partner interest and a large limited partner interest they can then give all or a portion of the limited partner interest to their children and grandchildren this interest can go to the heirs directly or be set aside in a trust benefits of an flp transferring limited partnership interests to family members reduces the taxable estate of senior family members the senior family members transfer the value of the asset to their children removing it from their estates for federal estate tax purposes while retaining control over the decisions and distributions of the investment since the limited partners cannot control investments or distributions they may be eligible for valuation discounts at the time of transfer transfers of limited partnership interests are also eligible for the annual gift tax exclusion a powerful tool for reducing income gift and estate taxes according to law the value of limited partnership shares can be discounted when transferred to family members in addition because of an flps flexibility the family members who are owners can usually amend the partnership agreement as family circumstances change an flp also protects assets from claims of future creditors and spouses of failed marriages creditors may not force cash distributions vote or own the interest of a limited partner without the consent of the general partners and in the event of a divorce where a limited partner ceases to be a family member the partnership documents can require a transfer back to the family for fair market value keeping the asset within the family structure by combining investments together into an flp a familys investment fees are significantly reduced instead of maintaining separate brokerage accounts or trusts for each child the partnership can hold one brokerage account and the children or trusts for children can own partnership interests how do i begin an flp must be structured with both the present and future owners in mind protecting the generations of today as well as generations to come to begin the flp process a written limited partnership agreement must be prepared after the agreement is prepared assets may be transferred such as real estate corporate stock or cash flps are not designed for the transfer of an individuals home life insurance or retirement plans the general partnership interests are retained by the senior partners for their lifetime while the limited partnership interests are given as gifts over time to the limited partners be careful with flps care should be taken both when creating the flp and in observing the formalities of operating the flp as a family business be sure to investigate state laws and the rights and obligations associated with transferred property and always discuss any of these decisions with professional appraisers ensure your loved ones and property are protected start my estate plan sign up to receive our newsletter and get the latest in business news popular

for usas featured inwhat is a family limited partnership flp – pros  consby kiara ashanti posted in taxesshare tweet pincommentsthe us could experience some rather drastic tax changes in the near future for instance if the socalled buffett rule passes capital gains taxes would increase from  to  for those with incomes above  or  those with a  million in hard assets another looming tax hike are the bush tax cuts that are set to expire in  pushing rates up for many americanswhile these two tax alterations are not set in stone one sure thing to consider is that the estate tax will be returning to  from the current rates of  and the amount you can exclude from your estate for tax purposes will be reduced from  million to the  rate of  million when a valuable inheritance is rich in land but light in cash paying more than half your inheritance is a greater burden especially if you have to sell the property to pay the taxesif you are a business owner you must plan ahead for any of these potential tax eventualities the buffett rule may never transpire but estate taxes will not go away and there’s a good chance that the bush tax cuts will expire or be alteredbut how do you plan for changes in the tax code that have not happened yet – or might not happen at all it’s simple focus on financial instruments and entities that will allow you to protect your assets and mitigate changes in the tax code if you have a business that involves family members or a business or assets that you want to leave to your family then one such entity is the family limited partnership flpwhat is a family limited partnershipa family limited partnership is a partnership agreement that exists between family members who are actively involved in a trade or business the partnership divides rights to income appreciation and control among the family members according to the family’s overall objectivesthe family “business” does not actually have to be a business in the traditional sense – assets such as real estate or investments can also be in a flp as can the family farm ranch or real estate holdings the nature of the flp allows you to shift the value of assets to other members thereby reducing the size of the estate for certain membersa family as defined for tax purposes only includes a person’s spouse children ancestors including parents lineal descendants grandchildren and any other trusts established for the benefit of those people so for example a newly married spouse could be part of the partnership but not a second cousinthe most common way of setting up an flp is to create a general partnership first with limited partnership interests the general partner or partners then gift the limited partnership interest to the children or other family members who are eligible whomever holds the general partner title maintains control over the enterprise or assets but the limited partnership interest lets children or other eligible family memberships share in the ownershipthis is probably where the concept of not mixing family with business originated business interests are ripe for family conflict so why would anyone create an flp and risk family strifeadvantages of flps estate planning is simple and estate tax savings are substantial the flp is a frequentlyused technique to shift income tax burdens from parents to children as an estate planning tool the interests transferred to your children including all appreciation since the transfer escape inclusion in your estate when you die only the value of the taxable gifts at the time they were transferred into the flp are included for purposes of estate taxesfor example if the value of the partner interests are valued at  but in  years rise to a value of  million only the  amount would be included in the estate for the purposes of estate planning this can lead to estate tax savings down the road transferring of ownership is systematic if a business is a sole proprietorship at the death of the owner the value of the business is included in the value of the estate if it is set up as a corporation again the value of the shares of the corporation is fully in the value of the estatean flp however allows the owner to set up family members as limited partners and allow them to transfer partnership interests over time this results in a gradual systematic transfer of ownership the value of the partnership interests is not included in the value of the estate of the general partner when he dies there are significant income tax benefits aside from the estate planning advantages the family limited partnership can lead to substantial income tax savings by including your children as partners and sharing partnership income with them total family taxes may be reduced because your children as limited partners own part of the companyfor example most small businesses in the country are set up as subchapter s corporations this setup allows owners to take the profits of the corporation and pass them on as personal income to the owners – and this is the reason many in congress oppose higher taxes on the  per year income threshold if however you choose to set up an flp the general partner can share the income with his two kids he may pay each  reducing his income for tax purposes to  not there is however an important caveat here you cannot shift income to children younger than  in the old days this was a favored tactic of the rich and infamous rich fathers and uncles would put the fiveyear old on the payroll and pay him  million that is a nono in today’s world for any child younger than  any income over  will be taxed at the top marginal rate of his parentsdisadvantages of flps children may be exposed to major capital gains liability gifted property does not receive the steppedup basis treatment that bequeathed property receives the term “steppedup” refers to the value of an asset when a person dies and leaves the asset to an heir for example an uncle buys  shares of apple stock when it is only  per share he dies and leaves it to his favorite niece the value of the apple stock and what the niece gains or loses is based on the market price on the day she took ownership not the price the uncle paid this is important because if it were based on the latter amount her capital gains liability would be steepin an flp however this may not be the case and children may be exposed to significant capital gains liability this varies depending on the type of property being transferred and what has happened to it it’s always best to discuss with an attorney potential capital gains issues – and it’s always important to remember that property in an flp does not have the same steppedup value basis as property left to heirs general partners could be at risk unlike corporations and trusts general partners are not insulated from potential lawsuits judgments or creditor seizures the parents as general partners are  in control of the assets and  responsible for a potential lawsuit general partners have no asset protection in these cases it can be difficult to transfer ownership to children under  flps are not the best entity for transferring assets or business interest to family members who are under the age of  first of all  the minor’s interest would have to be held by a parent or guardian second partners must be able to play a role in the daytoday management and operations of the business this also makes partnership interest unsuitable for family members who are older than  but are away in college nonbusiness assets could become large tax liabilities if the flp you have or will create is for the sole purpose of nonbusiness assets such as real estate or investment securities then you must be careful – you could find the flp to be considered an investment company this may cause capital gains and therefore losses realized on the transfer of property into the partnershipfor instance a beach house owned by a grandfather and grandmother increases in value from  to  million if the flp is labeled as an investment company then transferring ownership of the beach house to the flp could create a capital gain of just under  million and a tax bill of approximately  dollars if you only have one type of property then other type of trusts are better suited to avoid large tax liabilitiesfinal wordthe scenario just described is not one that normally happens under partnership rules but it can despite that the benefits of the family limited partnership can be significant – but only if set up correctlywhen dealing with any type of estate planning strategy using an attorney in conjunction with a financial advisor is a must speak with more than one flps are the favorite of attorneys while investment professionals and cpas sometimes like to use other estate planning tools such as trusts limited liability companies or partnerships setting up an flp can cost anywhere between  to  dollars with ongoing costs after setup given the costs getting a second or even third opinion in this area is a smart move worth the extra effort and timephoto credit bigstockrelatedk views

limited partnership there are typical limited partnership structures for families  most often mom and dad form the partnership and contribute various incomeproducing or business assets in exchange for their respective partnership interests  they can initially receive a small interest in the partnership as the general partners  as such they equally control the partnership as they previously controlled the contributed assets  mom and dad may each also receive as limited partners the remaining majority interest in the limited partnership general and limited partners can be the same parties and both can own an interest in a limited partnership thus mom and dad enjoy exclusive equal ownership and control of the partnership and its assets just as they controlled their assets titled in their own names  but their assets are now fully protected from creditors there are many ways to structure a family partnership  if dad has creditors mom may become the general partner  or mom and dad could form a corporation or preferably a limited liability company to be the general partner in the partnership  this is a particularly good choice if the partnership can incur liabilities for which the general partners are liable  they may subsequently transfer their limited partnership interests perhaps gradually gift their limited partnership interests to their children to a living trust or some other entity which may also be the limited partner  the limited partnership structure is flexible  the family limited partnership works well for estate planning and adapts itself to a systematic gifting program a most attractive tax feature of the family limited partnership is its ability to spread the tax burden between the partners any way they choose  for example general partner dad in a high tax bracket could contribute large amounts of money to a partnership while retaining only a small interest but full control  the tax burden for this contribution would thus be spread to the limited partners the children who own the majority interest in the partnership  combining trusts with limited partnerships makes for a powerful family asset protection device  however combining a trust with a limited partnership is a more complicated structure than using either alone combining the family limited partnership with the living trust can provide a superior estate plan  the partnership as owner of the family assets provides protection and discounted valuations for estate tax purposes  the limited partnership interests owned by the partners respective living trusts lets the partners bequeath their partnership interest while avoiding probate  in structuring this arrangement between spouses who own the partnership it is assumed that they will take advantage of the unlimited marital deduction  upon the grantors death the family trust becomes irrevocable succeeded by two internal trusts a creditequivalent bypass trust and a marital trust  this strategy essentially transfers the estate tax liability to the surviving spouses estate and defers estate taxes  the customary probate complexities and costs are avoided when the partnership interests are owned by living trusts  delays in completing probate are avoided and creditors need not be notified allowing disposition economically quickly and efficiently yes you can lose everything you may think that your wealth is safe and that you dont need protection  but dont delude yourself and accept reality — for every  minutes you spend making money spend  seconds thinking about how to protect it

attorneys asher rubinstein practice areas tax law asset protection efficacy of family limited partnerships  a case study  the family limited partnership flp is probably the most beneficial structure available for wealth preservation via asset protection estate planning and tax minimization although you cant take it with you by placing your assets into flps you can legally and successfully protect everything you own from attack by creditors and from erosion by exorbitant taxes in order to illustrate the efficacy of family limited partnerships from an asset protection estate planning and tax minimization point of view consider the case of dr jones a fictitious character derived from actual client situations although for illustration purposes we have created a hypothetical physician the principles discussed herein apply equally to all professionals and indeed to all individuals who have accumulated significant wealth dr jones is a successful physician in long island new york he is approximately  years old is married with three teenaged children and is chief of surgery at a major hospital dr jones estate is worth approximately five million dollars in addition to his surgery practice dr jones owns his home as well as several investment properties including an apartment building and a shopping center dr jones also sits on the board of directors of his hospital and his country club dr jones wanted to establish a wealth preservation strategy for three specific reasons dr jones was very concerned by the proliferation of medical malpractice lawsuits and wanted to protect his significant assets in the event that he was sued by a patient in addition dr jones knew that as a landlord he was prone to litigation from tenants and other persons who might be injured on one of his properties he was sensitive to the fact that as a physician and a property owner he was perceived as a deep pocket target by aggressive negligence lawyers dr jones wanted to reduce his estate tax liability so that upon his and his wifes deaths their children would inherit as much as legally possible with as little as possible or nothing paid to the irs in the form of inheritance taxes dr jones hoped to minimize his current income tax liability on the income received from his rental properties first goal asset protection asset protection is defined as the safeguarding of personal wealth from attack by future creditors assets are broadly defined and include homes cars boats jewelry business interests cash bank accounts brokerage accounts stocks bonds art and other collections real estate etc creditors are also broadly defined and include actual creditors as well as identifiable probable creditors such as litigants soontobe exspouses disgruntled business partners or anyone who you know that has a claim against you even if they do not yet know it creditors may even include government agencies such as the irs the effectiveness of an flp in providing asset protection is statutory meaning that it has been codified as law the revised uniform limited partnership act rulpa which has been adopted in all fifty states provides that the assets owned by a limited partnership are not owned by the individual partners therefore those assets cannot be attached by the personal creditors of a partner if a person contributes assets to an flp those assets are no longer owned by that person although as explained below the person may still control those assets and creditors of that person may not attach those assets merely because they have a judgment against a partner of the flp the essence of asset protection planning control everything but own nothing a family limited partnership is by definition a joint venture between family members the partnership is comprised of both general and limited partners dr and mrs jones are each the general partners because mrs jones is not a licensed physician dr jones is the sole general partner of the flp that owns the stock in his medical practice dr and mrs jones also own limited partnership interests as do their children the general partners manage and control the partnership the general partners decide and implement all decisions of the partnership such as whether to buy or sell an asset in the partnership what investments the partnership should make and whether to make a distribution of profits from the partnership the general partners may even determine to dissolve the flp it should be apparent that the general partners control the operation of the partnership in their absolute discretion dr and mrs jones thus control the assets and make the decisions regarding those assets just as they did before the flp although they transferred legal ownership or title to those assets to the flp they retained control unlike corporations flps are not democracies  there is no  majority control even if they own  of the flp the limited partners do not outvote the general partners the limited partners in the flp are similar to silent partners or passive investors they have equity interests in the partnership but have no decision making authority over the partnership or the assets therein limited partners for example are not entitled to demand distributions or other payments from the flp in addition limited partners may not sell or assign their partnership interests without the consent of the general partners nor force the liquidation of the flp the general partners are thus in complete control of the flp although they do not own the assets in the flp the structure of the asset protection plan segregation of high risk assets dr jones and his advisors set up a complete flp plan in order to achieve his first goal asset protection early in the process they took inventory of dr jones assets they examined each asset individually and evaluated its likelihood of being attacked based on the chances it would generate a liability they placed each of dr jones properties into a separate flp thus the shopping center that he owned was placed in one flp and his apartment building was placed in another flp the reason for treating each real estate asset individually and placing each one in its own flp is to minimize the litigation exposure of each asset if an flp would be sued as owner of a property by someone hurt on that property assets in a different flp would not be in danger in general high risk assets or those prone to litigation such as rental property should be kept separate from low risk assets like dr jones personal bank and brokerage accounts which were all placed into one flp dr jones home was also placed into a separate flp dr jones private medical practice was registered as a professional corporation dr jones owned one hundred percent of the stock of that corporation and he placed that stock into a separate flp if dr jones were to get sued the professional corporation would cease paying him a salary instead it would distribute profits and management fees directly to its shareholder the flp where the money would be protected thus dr jones assets were protected from each other and as explained below they were all protected from any future personal attack against him keeping the wolves out a few examples during one snowy winter day a tenant in dr jones apartment building stepped outside took a few steps and promptly slipped on the icy sidewalk an aggressive personal injury attorney convinced the tenant to sue her landlord for injuries sustained in the fall including pain and suffering loss of income and posttraumatic stress the tenants spouse also sued for loss of consortium the attorney expecting to reap a windfall from a deep pocket doctor took the case on a  contingency when the attorney investigated who the landlord was to his chagrin he learned that it was the dr jones apartments family limited partnership not dr jones himself a little more research revealed that the partnership owned no assets other than the apartment building and a local bank held a large mortgage on the building all of dr jones other assets were owned by other flps which had nothing to do with this accident and could therefore not be included in this lawsuit to their great disappointment the tenants and their attorney quickly understood that there was no deep pocket and there would be no windfall the attorney realized that even if he won the case the judgment would be uncollectible since  of zero equals zero he quickly settled for whatever dr jones insurance company offered and went away the very next month an auto accident occurred in the parking lot of dr jones shopping center a smarter more aggressive negligence lawyer realizing that a lawsuit against the dr jones shopping center family limited partnership would not yield very much also sued dr and mrs jones personally as general partners of the flp he claimed that as general partners they were personally liable for the flps negligence in maintaining the shopping center dr and mrs jones attorney promptly informed the plaintiffs negligence lawyer that dr and mrs jones had no attachable assets they owned nothing  not even dr jones medical practice although they controlled a great deal a judgment against dr and mrs jones would therefore be uncollectable once again there was no deep pocket and no windfall rather than wasting his time on a case with little or no potential reward this lawyer also quickly settled for dr jones insurance companys offer the following summer when a guest was hurt in the swimming pool at dr jones country club the injured guest sued not only the country club but also each of the members of the clubs board of directors including of course dr jones the plaintiff claimed negligent supervision of the club by its directors unfortunately the country club did not carry errors and omissions insurance for its directors again dr jones attorney promptly explained to the plaintiffs attorney that dr jones had no attachable assets in order to avoid a lengthy litigation and its attendant legal expenses dr jones offered to settle the lawsuit against him for a nominal amount  less than the expected cost of legal fees to defend it dr jones made his settlement offer to the plaintiff on a take it or leave it basis since the settlement offer was better than an uncollectible judgment the plaintiff reluctantly took it the plaintiff pursued his litigation against the country club and the other unprotected directors while dr jones watched from the golf course finally one of dr jones patients developed a postsurgical infection with complications the patient sued dr jones the hospital and every doctor and nurse who had any contact with the patient during and after the surgery the lawsuit demanded  in damages from each defendant jointly and severally unfortunately last year dr jones malpractice insurance company had reduced the liability limits of all policies across the board to  maximum per occurrence if the plaintiff were to win his lawsuit dr jones would be personally liable for  once again dr jones attorney uttered the magic words no attachable assets the plaintiff accepted the insurance companys payment of  in full settlement of his claim against dr jones and dropped the doctor from the lawsuit in each of the above cases the fact that dr jones had no attachable assets served to effectively discourage the lawsuit once the plaintiff realized that even if it wins the lawsuit it would be almost impossible to collect a judgment the plaintiff was forced to accept a settlement on dr jones terms this indeed is the real value of asset protection via flps recourse of a judgment creditor ko with a k but what if a plaintiff refuses to settle prosecutes its lawsuit and wins a humongous judgment against dr jones the successful plaintiff in this scenario who is now known as a judgment creditor is limited to a charging order a charging order entitles the judgment creditor to receive dr jones share of any distribution of profits or assets made by the flp the judgment creditor is still not entitled to reach the assets owned by the flp distributions are however made in the sole and absolute discretion of the general partners dr and mrs jones as general partners they may determine never to make a distribution the flp may still pay salary to mrs jones who is not a judgment debtor and it may make loans to dr jones children who also are not judgment debtors neither of these payments are distributions to dr jones they are therefore not subject to the charging order and beyond the reach of the judgment creditor the judgment creditors charging order is however a poisonous piece of paper one that will cause the creditor great harm although the flp might never make a distribution the judgment creditors right to such distribution makes him liable for the tax on the income he never receives this is known as the phantom income doctrine the flp issues a tax form known as a schedule k to each partner once a year this schedule k sets forth that partners share of flp income whether distributed or not each partner attaches the schedule k to his or her income tax return and includes his or her share of flp income on the tax return whether distributed or not if a creditor obtains a charging order entitling him to dr jones share of the flps distributions the flp will issue the schedule k to that creditor instead of to dr jones pursuant to revenue ruling  the irs will require the judgment creditor in possession of a charging order to pay tax on dr jones share of flp income even though that income is never distributed this has a profound effect in deterring litigants and creditors from bringing lawsuits against defendants like dr jones whose assets are owned by flps dr jones asset protection plan provided him and his family with complete protection from lawsuits not only by protecting their assets from attack by judgment creditors but more importantly by discouraging the lawsuits in the first place injured parties did receive reasonable compensation from dr jones insurers and left dr jones alone a word about fraudulent conveyances it should be noted that the establishment of an asset protection plan solely to protect assets from existing creditors may be construed as an improper attempt to thwart such creditors in this regard a creditor may attack an flp plan as having been established fraudulently for the specific purpose of evading debts due to that creditor for this reason clients should establish their asset protection plan before any claims arise against them if it is too late to do this clients should at least have another valid purpose apart from asset protection as the reason behind their flp plan estate planning and income tax minimization both of which are discussed below are such valid purposes thus it is important to implement an flp plan in the context of complete estate and tax planning including the execution of a valid will and the establishment of appropriate trusts if the flp plan is included as part of a comprehensive estate and tax plan creditors will have far less likelihood of successfully arguing that the flps were established solely to avoid creditors second goal minimization of estate taxes as noted earlier when dr and mrs jones pass away assuming no change in the value of their assets their estate would be worth five million dollars the unified credit that is currently allowed by law exempts estate assets valued at  per person dr and mrs jones combined unified credits of  would reduce the value of their taxable estate to  which would be subject to estate tax at a current rate of approximately  thus if dr and mrs jones did not set up an flp plan  would pass to their heirs free of taxes via the unified credits and their heirs would split the remaining  with the government  to the jones children  and  to the irs  clearly dr and mrs jones would like to redirect legally of course as much as possible of the irs  to their children at this point it is important to digress from dr jones and his family and consider an important issue the propriety of tax minimization there is absolutely nothing immoral illegal unethical or even unpatriotic about minimizing your tax obligation it is a criminal act to engage in tax evasion or tax fraud however the structuring of your assets through legal means to pay as little as possible to the irs and preserve as much as possible for yourself and your family is completely valid and legal consider the comments of judge learned hand one of the most important federal judges of the last century over and over again courts have said that there is nothing sinister in arranging ones affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible everybody does so rich and poor and all do right for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands taxes are enforced exactions not voluntary contributions commissioner of internal revenue v newman  fd  d cir  dissenting opinion see also gregory v helvering  us  the legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes or altogether avoid them by means which the law permits cannot be avoided family limited partnerships legally save estate taxes by the combined operation of discounting the value of limited partnership interests and gifting the discounted limited interests the two principals work together first the value of a limited interest in the flp is discounted once discounted more flp interests can be gifted taxfree to the next generation which results in more assets passing out of an individuals taxable estate it is important to remember that as explained above a limited interest has no right to control the flp that right is reserved to the general partners dr and mrs jones and is never given away the principal of discounting recognizes two inherent reductions in the value of a limited interest in a family limited partnership one reduction in value is due to the fact that a limited interest in an flp is a noncontrolling interest in a family enterprise a purchaser of such a limited interest would be an outsider and would have no right to expect any distributions from the flp unless the general partner decided to make one or unless all general partners died and the flp liquidated a second reduction in value is due to the fact that there is no ready market for the purchase and sale of flp limited interests and therefore no liquidity the courts have forced the irs to recognize the validity of these two discounts and such recognition has been codified by the irs in revenue ruling  the irs routinely accepts discounts in values of limited interests in flps varying from thirty percent to as high as fifty percent depending among other things on the liquidity of the flps assets the likelihood of a distribution or liquidation and the profitability of the flp it is important to understand that the discount applies to the value of the interest in the flp the value of the asset held in the flp remains the same thus for example the jones family home was worth  before dr jones began his estate planning and the value of the home remained  after it was contributed to the flp if the home was sold it would command a sale price of  whether or not it was contained within the flp although the value of the home is preserved the flp can accomplish significant estate tax savings via gifting of discounted limited interests in the jones residence family limited partnership the irs would recognize a  discount in the value of a limited interest in an flp containing nonliquid assets such as a home thus although the flp containing the jones family home is worth  the value of all the limited interests of the flp discounted at a rate of  equals  assume that dr jones wished to gift as much as possible to his children during his lifetime in order to minimize the value of his estate at death using  of their combined  unified credit dr jones and his wife would make a taxfree gift of  worth of limited partnership interests to their three children the unified credit is not exclusively reserved for death it may instead be used to exempt a gift made during ones life from gift taxes because of the discounting this gift would effectively transfer all the limited interests in that flp out of their estate to their children in effect by making a  taxfree gift of discounted interests dr and mrs jones transferred  of a  partnership with an actual value of  upon their deaths dr and mrs jones as  general partners would each own  worth of partnership interests but they would have controlled the entire  flp until the very end in addition future appreciation on the value of the limited partnership interests given to the children will be excluded from dr and mrs jones taxable estate dr and mrs jones used their total combined unified credits  to make four sets of taxfree gifts of  worth of discounted limited interests in the following flps  jones residence family limited partnership  actual flp value   discounted value of limited interests  dr jones apartments family limited partnership  actual flp value   discounted value of limited interests  dr jones shopping center family limited partnership  actual flp value   discounted value of limited interests  dr jones md pc family limited partnership  actual flp value   discounted value of limited interests  in addition to unified credit gifts of limited partnership interests as described above dr and mrs jones may also take advantage of taxfree exclusionary gifts of  worth of limited partnership interests that may be conveyed each year by each parent to as many people as the parent chooses thus dr jones is able to make an annual gift of  worth of limited partnership interests to each of the three jones children and mrs jones may make an identical  gift each year to each of the three jones children these exclusionary gifts of limited partnership interests may take advantage of the same discounting as above again these taxfree gifts of discounted interests totaling  would effectively remove assets with an actual value of  from dr and mrs jones taxable estate after these gifts dr and mrs jones each owned  of the abovementioned flps as general partner and their children together owned  of each flp as limited partners in addition dr and mrs jones each still owned   general partner interest and  limited partner interest in the jones liquid asset family limited partnership total flp value  dr jones owned  of the dr jones md pc family limited partnership as general partner and the jones children together owned  of that flp as limited partners mrs jones was not a general partner of the dr jones md pc family limited partnership see footnote  supra if they were to die at that time the total value of their combined taxable estate would be approximately  the estate tax would be approximately  instead of  the current estate tax rate on  is approximately  dr and mrs jones would benefit from an immediate tax savings of more than  in  the unified credit will increase to  per person in one more year dr and mrs jones may utilize the increased credit to gift limited interests in the jones liquid asset family limited partnership again at discounted values to their children thus in approximately one year dr and mrs jones will each own only  of a  estate but control that estate in its entirety and their estate tax liability will be essentially reduced to zero in summary dr jones second goal  minimization of estate taxes and preservation of family wealth for his heirs  is efficiently and completely accomplished by the use of flps through the principle of discounting coupled with taxfree gifting of the discounted limited partnership interests the value of dr and mrs jones taxable estate will be reduced to zero although they will retain complete control over their assets as general partners of the flps through the implementation of the flp plan the jones children will be able to enjoy all of their parents wealth with nothing paid to the irs third goal minimization of income tax flps accomplish income tax minimization via the principle of income spreading the principle of income spreading essentially allows for income to be spread among various partners of the flp including children who are usually in lower tax brackets income earned by children under  years of age is taxed at their parents income tax bracket income earned by children over  years of age is taxed at the childrens own income tax bracket rather than taxing all of the income at the highest tax bracket of the wealthy parents income spreading is available to partnerships actually engaged in business eg owning or managing rental property or owning a controlling interest in a business consider once again dr jones and his family dr jones with income as chief of surgery at the hospital his private medical practice his ownership of a shopping center and an apartment building is taxed at the highest income tax bracket possible on the other hand dr jones teenaged children are all students and each is in the lowest tax bracket when dr and mrs jones transferred their assets into flps the flps became the owners of the assets any income earned on these assets for example rental income received from the shopping center and rental income from the apartment building is no longer directly taxable as dr jones income but instead is treated as income of the appropriate flp partnerships including flps are treated as flow through entities for tax purposes income earned by an flp flows through to the general and limited partners of that flp and is taxed according to the tax bracket of each respective partner as noted above dr and mrs jones gave each of their children a  interest in each realty flp thus when the partnerships income flows through to each partner each child will pay income tax at his or her lower bracket on  of the income earned by that flp the flp may distribute or lend enough money to each partner to pay the income taxes dr and mrs jones will pay income tax at their higher bracket on only  of the flps income as a result there is an overall lower tax on the familys income flps also allow for another level of income tax minimization similar to the income tax deduction granted to an individual for contributing to a qualified retirement plan since the realty flps are engaged in the business of owning and managing rental properties these flps may employ dr jones mrs jones and each of their children to provide services to the flp eg management bookkeeping rent collection etc the flps can therefore contribute pretax dollars to qualified pension plans on behalf of the flps employees contributions made by the flps to such pension plans would be taxdeductible expenses of the flps reducing the gross income of the flps prior to the flow through of net income to the individual partners conclusion family limited partnerships allowed dr jones to achieve three very important wealth preservation goals first he protected his assets from litigants and creditors and discouraged a variety of potentially severe lawsuits second he eliminated the estate taxes that would be due upon his and mrs jones deaths thus preserving the familys entire wealth for their children rather than paying exorbitant estate taxes to the irs third he reduced his income tax liability on the income received from his real estate investments these goals were achieved expeditiously professionally and legally by taking advantage of the provisions of the revised uniform limited partnership act and the favorable tax treatment of family limited partnerships email print share wwwtwittercom wwwlinkedincom  n th pl scottsdale az  owner hayjour family limited partnership property and business record

work the older generation ie parents become owners with  stake in the business and thereby establish themselves as general partners in a family limited partnership over a period of time by gifting limited partnership interests the younger generation ie children end up as limited partners with a  stake in the business this all sounds wonderful and an almost ideal tax deferral strategy but is there a catch to all of this great taxfree wealth transfer and strategy gifting to the younger generation with a family limited partnership the result is highly appreciated assets are transferred from the estate of the parents to the children presumably taxfree when carefully and properly implemented the family limited partnership is a useful tool but there are better ways to achieve a significantly more efficient transfer of wealth did you know the irs considers these family limited partnership arrangements abusive when overzealous practitioners over claim two commonly used discounts in the valuation of underlying highly appreciated assets in estate tax valuations the irs comes down significantly hard when these arrangements are made over a deathbed especially in the hours or days before death please note that theres an increasing congressional opposition to the use of family limited partnerships two discount estate tax valuations of underlying assets in family partnerships are lack of marketability discounting which is typically  to  reduced estate tax valuation due to a limited market for the business or the assets if sold limited minority interest discounting which is typically an additional  to  reduced estate tax valuation to the minority position lack of control in the business or underlying assets combined these two discounts can amount up to  or more but how much is too much disadvantages of family limited partnerships gifted property does not receive the steppedup basis treatment that bequeathed property receives therefore the children who have received gifted partnership interests may face unexpected capital gains tax liability if discounting is reasonably and carefully applied its a significant tax saving devise keeping in mind that its great for the parents not so good for the children because of the unexpected capital gains tax liability that can be imposed on the children general partners are not insulated from potential lawsuits judgments or creditor seizures this problem can be avoided if the general partner is the ultra trust the parents as general partners are  in control of the assets and  responsible for a potential lawsuit general partners will have no asset protection in these cases family business succession estate planning if you have an interest in family business succession planning there
