original formulas are timetested  have been manufactured since 9  trusted by millions of people because they work time  time again we hear from customers that they tried another brand but did not experience the same results as with dr christopher’s formulas to this we reply it’s because the quality  experience that is put into every bottle we make from the fields that harvest our herbs through the state of art manufacturing processes down to the finish product that our customers take daily dr john r christopher was a pioneer of natural supplements that are very common today far ahead of his time john began formulating when no one sold wholesale herbs so he had to find ingredients  create his own formulas over the years he created more than  formulas that are still used by millions today dr christopher’s fame grew rapidly  in 9 he set up the school of natural healing that is still operating today  many founders of other herbal businesses have studied  learned from his philosophy he wrote  books that continue to be great sellers he gave more than  lectures  seminars internationally  in the united states dr christopher’s legacy continues in the lives he touched  in his herbal formulas will aid through generations to come we only use whole herbplant products not standardized today the process of extracting “leading active ingredients” is common place  is called “standardization” it’s all the rage throughout the chemical  natural food industry the theory is that if one dose of a “suspected” key ingredient is good a large dose all at once of that ingredients is better not so those leading active ingredients are properly placed by nature in proportions mixed with other ingredients to keep the herb in perfect balance synergistically when taken in whole form they present to your body a balanced solution dr christopher strongly demanded his company only manufacture herbal products using the whole herb never extracting a single ingredient he understood the necessity of using herbs the way nature had intended them in their whole state we only accept nontreated or steam treated organic  wildcrafted herbs when available reasons for unavailability endangered out of season failed crops etc  all ingredients are listed on our product label we are  pure we do not use chemicals or chemical clones added fillersflow agents or genetically modified ingredients that many companies use to cheapen their product for profit as the saying goes “you get what you pay for” if you start with a cheap raw material there is nothing you can do in the manufacturing process to improve quality sourcing highquality ingredients for our formulas is key often we will receive a sample from a supplier  test results show that it does not contain active constituents in proper ratios so it is rejected  the sourcing process continues until the high quality expectations are met unfortunately there are many that do not share the same high standards in the marketplace today  as is always the case we get what we pay for we can’t expect a cheap car to out perform  have the luxuries of a topoftheline vehicle just as we shouldn’t expect a cheaply made herbal product to benefit our body the same way the highestquality supplements will our vegetarian caps are manufactured with stateoftheart technology  made from a vegetable derived raw material our hard shell vegetable capsules are produced with hydroxipropylmethylcellulose hpmc derived from wood and cotton fibers which is certified as kosher for year round  passover use by the union of orthodox jewish congregations of america  meets all requirements of current usp and fcc food chemical codex hpmc they are considered generally recognized as safe gras by fda are nonionic  sulfate free finally there now is a real alternative for vegetarians  consumers who are restricted by religion from taking capsules made from beef or pork by products dr christopher extracts are a  ratio  part herb to  part vegetable glycerin or pure grain alcohol we use a cold percolation process to ensure that no enzymes are destroyed this extraction process preserves the natural occuring enzymes in the plant product unfortunately it’s all too common for other manufacturers to use a heating process which destroys many of the vital nutrients  enzymes in the plant our glycerin is tested for deg contamination and is deg free kosher  derived from palm we do not rely on cofa’s certificates of analysis from any source as we validate the identity of each plant  finished product through high performance thin layer chromatography to ensure their quality many competitors use ir infrared to verify the identity of each plant this method is cheaper less accurate  does not have the ability to detect contaminates such as pesiticides in the herb we do organoleptic testing  a full spectrum of microbiological testing on each plant  those tests include tvc total viable count yeast  mold counts coliform counts ecoli  salmonella other quality assurance tests performed on our raw materials include high performance liquid chromatography gas chromatography  heavy metal icpms test our raw materials  finished products go through more testing than many of our competitors to ensure our customers all over the world get consistently highquality products we meet  exceed current government gmp good manufacturing practices quality standards our state of the art production  raw materials storage facilities includes a climatecontrolled warehouse  cuttingedge laboratory equipment our
