april  the year when its nucleus bank in winterthur was founded although the merged companys new name was originally supposed to be the united bank of switzerland the officials opted to call it simply

international investment banking business particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where warburg dillon read was considered to be the more established platform union bank of switzerland had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in switzerland while both banks had strong asset management capabilities after the merger was completed it was speculated that a series of losses

its key swiss rivals and viewed ltcm as the type of client that could help accelerate the banks growth in  ubs entered into a financing arrangement with ltcm and the hedge fund quickly became the banks largest client generating us million in fees for ubs union bank of switzerland sold ltcm a year european call option on  million shares in ltcm then valued at about us million it hedged this option by purchasing a us million interest in ltcm and invested a further us million in the hedge fund originally intended to provide ubs with a steady stream of income ubs instead suffered major losses when the hedge fund collapsed following the merger swiss bank managers were surprised to discover the massive exposure to ltcm at ubs ultimately ubs was unable to sell or hedge its interest in ltcm as its value declined in the summer of  by november  ubss losses from its exposure to ltcm were estimated at the level of approximately chf  million ubs would prove to be the largest single loser in the ltcm collapse ultimately writing off chf  million the federal reserve bank of new york organized a bailout of us billion by the hedge funds major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets ubs contributed us million to the bailout effort which would largely be recovered in the aftermath of the ltcm collapse mathis cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of ubs along with

growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms costas had followed a similar approach in building out the ubs fixed income business hiring over  sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from us million in  to over us billion by  the arrival of former drexel burnham lambert investment banker ken moelis marked a major coup for costas moelis joined ubs from donaldson lufkin  jenrette in  shortly after its acquisition by credit suisse first boston although huw jenkins claimed he had hired moelis to the uk

their departures in march  moelis announced that he was leaving the company and shortly thereafter founded a new business moelis  company as he had when joining ubs moelis took a large team of senior ubs investment bankers moeliss departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the banks balance sheet to pursue large transactions particularly leveraged buyouts the banks apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees

investment banking business particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where warburg dillon read was considered to be the more established platform union bank of switzerland had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in switzerland while both banks had strong asset management capabilities after the merger was completed it was speculated that a series of losses suffered by ubs

collapse ultimately writing off chf  million the federal reserve bank of new york organized a bailout of us billion by the hedge funds major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets ubs contributed us million to the bailout effort which would largely be recovered in the aftermath of the ltcm collapse mathis cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of ubs along with three other

growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms costas had followed a similar approach in building out the ubs fixed income business hiring over  sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from us million in  to over us billion by  the arrival of former drexel burnham lambert investment banker ken moelis marked a major coup for costas moelis joined ubs from donaldson lufkin  jenrette in  shortly after its acquisition by credit suisse first boston although huw jenkins claimed he had hired moelis to the uk

their departures in march  moelis announced that he was leaving the company and shortly thereafter founded a new business moelis  company as he had when joining ubs moelis took a large team of senior ubs investment bankers moeliss departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the banks balance sheet to pursue large transactions particularly leveraged buyouts the banks apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees

compensate holocaust survivors who were making claims against the bank in january  christoph meili a night watchman at the union bank of switzerland found employees shredding archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with nazi germany the shredding was in direct violation of a thenrecent swiss law adopted in december  protecting such material ubs acknowledged that it had made

largest bank in the world in  union bank of switzerlands management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger ebner who supported the idea of a merger led a shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of union bank of switzerlands chairman robert studer with mathis cabiallavetta one of the key architects of the merger with swiss bank corporation on  december  union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation announced an allstock merger at the time of the merger union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation were the second and third largest banks in

positions were filled by legacy swiss bank professionals prior to the merger swiss bank corporation was considered to be further along than union bank of switzerland in developing its international investment banking business particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where warburg dillon read was considered to be the more established platform union bank of switzerland had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in switzerland while both banks had strong asset management capabilities after the merger was completed it was speculated that a series of losses suffered by ubs on its equity derivative positions in late  was a contributing factor in pushing ubs management to consummate the merger the failure of long term capital management ltcmedit long term capital management ltcm was a us hedge fund used for trading strategies such as fixed income arbitrage statistical arbitrage and pairs trading combined with high leverage its collapse in  led to a bailout by major banks and investment houses and resulted in massive losses for ubs at a time when it had merged with swiss bank corporation however ubs involvement with ltcm predated the merger ubs had initially been reluctant to invest in ltcm rebuffing an investment in  and again shortly thereafter ubs suffering criticism for its conservative business model was looking for ways to catch up to its key swiss rivals and viewed ltcm as the type of client that could help accelerate the banks growth in  ubs entered into a financing arrangement with ltcm and the hedge fund quickly became the banks largest client generating us million in fees for ubs union bank of switzerland sold ltcm a year european call option on  million shares in ltcm then valued at about us million it hedged this option by purchasing a us million interest in ltcm and invested a further us million in the hedge fund originally intended to provide ubs with a steady stream of income ubs instead suffered major losses when

history representing a merger product of the union bank of switzerland and the swiss bank corporation in june  sbc the official founding date of the bank is april  the year when its nucleus bank in winterthur was founded although the merged companys new name was originally supposed to be the united bank of switzerland the officials opted to call it simply ubs because of a name clash with the separate swiss company united bank switzerland – a part of the united bank limiteds swiss subsidiary therefore ubs is no longer an acronym but is the companys brand its logo of three keys carried over from sbc stands for the companys values of confidence security and discretion ubs also comprises a number of wellknown securities firms that have been acquired by the bank and its predecessors among the banks most notable constituent parts are paine webber dillon read  co kidder peabody  co phillips  drew s g warburg  co blyth eastman dillon  co jackson  curtis and union securities among others swiss bank corporationedit origins and early years –edit swiss bank corporation logo ca  featuring the three keys meant to symbolize confidence security and discretion ubs through swiss bank corporation traces its history to  when six private banking firms in basel switzerland pooled their resources to form the bankverein a consortium that acted as an underwriting syndicate for its member banks in  the bankverein coordinated with the german frankfurter bankverein to form the basler bankverein a jointstock company replacing the original bankverein consortium after the new bank started with an initial commitment of chf  million and chf  million of share capital it soon experienced growing pains when heavy losses in germany caused it to suspend its dividend until  following the years  and  when the bank merged with the zürcher bankverein and acquired the basler depositenbank and the schweizerische unionbank it changed its name to schweizerischer bankverein the english name of the bank was originally swiss bankverein but was changed to swiss bank corporation sbc in  the basel offices of swiss bank corporation c sbc subsequently experienced a period of growth which was only interrupted by the onset of world war i in which the bank lost investments in a number of large industrial companies by the end of  the bank had recovered and surpassed chf  billion in total assets and grew to  employees by  the impact of the stock market crash of  and the great depression was severe particularly as the swiss franc suffered major devaluation in  the bank saw its assets fall from a  peak of chf  billion to its  levels of chf  billion by  in  sbc adopted its threekeys logo designed by warja honeggerlavater symbolizing confidence security and discretion which remains an integral part in the currentday logo of ubs on the eve of world war ii in  sbc like other swiss banks was the recipient of large influxes of foreign funds for safekeeping just prior to the outbreak of the war sbc made the timely decision to open an office in new york city the office located in the equitable building was able to begin operations a few weeks after the outbreak of the war and was intended as a safe place to store assets in the case of an invasion during the war the banks traditional business fell off and the swiss government became their largest client postwar years –edit in  sbc acquired the basler handelsbank commercial bank of basel which was one of the largest banks in switzerland but became insolvent by the end of the war sbc remained among the swiss governments leading underwriters of debt in the postwar years sbc which had entered the s with  branch offices in switzerland and three abroad more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to chf  billion by the end of the s and doubled assets again in the mids exceeding chf  billion by  in  sbc acquired banque populaire valaisanne based in sion switzerland and the banque populaire de sierre the bank opened a

investment banking business particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where warburg dillon read was considered to be the more established platform union bank of switzerland had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in switzerland while both banks had strong asset management capabilities after the merger was completed it was speculated that a series of losses suffered by ubs

collapse ultimately writing off chf  million the federal reserve bank of new york organized a bailout of us billion by the hedge funds major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets ubs contributed us million to the bailout effort which would largely be recovered in the aftermath of the ltcm collapse mathis cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of ubs along with three other

ubs investment bankers moeliss departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the banks balance sheet to pursue large transactions particularly leveraged buyouts the banks apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees

world war ii the issue of unclaimed property of holocaust victims became a major issue for ubs in the mids and a series of revelations in  brought the issue to the forefront of national attention in  and  ubs confirmed that a large number of accounts had gone unclaimed as a result of the banks policy of requiring death certificates from family members to claim the contents of the account ubss handling of these revelations were largely criticized and the bank received significant negative attention in the us ubs came under significant pressure particularly from american politicians to compensate holocaust survivors who were making claims against the bank in january  christoph meili a night watchman at the union bank of switzerland found employees shredding archives compiled by a subsidiary that had extensive dealings with nazi germany the shredding was in direct violation of a thenrecent swiss law adopted in december  protecting such material ubs acknowledged that it had made

largest bank in the world in  union bank of switzerlands management and board unanimously rebuffed the proposed merger ebner who supported the idea of a merger led a shareholder revolt that resulted in the replacement of union bank of switzerlands chairman robert studer with mathis cabiallavetta one of the key architects of the merger with swiss bank corporation on  december  union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation announced an allstock merger at the time of the merger union bank of switzerland and swiss bank corporation were the second and third largest banks in

banks common shares union bank of switzerlands mathis cabiallavetta became chairman of the new bank while swiss banks marcel ospel was named chief executive officer nearly  of the top management positions were filled by legacy swiss bank professionals prior to the merger swiss bank corporation was considered to be further along than union bank of switzerland in developing its international investment banking business particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where warburg dillon read was considered to be the more established platform union bank of switzerland had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in switzerland while both banks had strong asset management capabilities after the merger was completed it was speculated that a series of losses suffered by ubs on its equity derivative positions in late  was a contributing factor in pushing ubs management to consummate the merger the failure of long term capital management ltcmedit long term capital management ltcm was a us hedge fund used for trading strategies such as fixed income arbitrage statistical arbitrage and pairs trading combined with high leverage its collapse in  led to a bailout by

initially been reluctant to invest in ltcm rebuffing an investment in  and again shortly thereafter ubs suffering criticism for its conservative business model was looking for ways to catch up to its key swiss rivals and viewed ltcm as the type of client that could help accelerate the banks growth in  ubs entered into a financing arrangement with ltcm and the hedge fund quickly became the banks largest client generating us million in fees for ubs union bank of switzerland sold ltcm a year european call option on  million shares in ltcm then valued at about us million it hedged this option by purchasing a us million interest in ltcm and invested a further us million in the hedge fund originally intended to provide ubs with a steady stream of income ubs instead suffered major losses when the hedge fund collapsed following the merger swiss bank managers were surprised to discover the massive exposure to ltcm at ubs ultimately ubs was unable to sell or hedge its interest in ltcm as its value declined in the summer of  by november  ubss losses from its exposure to ltcm were estimated at the level of approximately chf  million ubs would prove to be the largest single loser in the ltcm collapse ultimately writing off chf  million the federal reserve bank of new york organized a bailout of us billion by the hedge funds major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets ubs contributed us million to the bailout effort which would largely be recovered in the aftermath of the ltcm collapse mathis cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of ubs along with three other executives following its involvement with ltcm ubs issued a statement given the developments in the international financial markets in the future ubs will  focus even more intensively on those areas of business likely to generate sustainable earnings with a justifiable level of risk rising in the ranks –edit ubs painewebber logo in use from  until  when the use of the paine webber brand was

banks in which ubs then had little success while rival credit suisse was establishing itself as a major player on wall street with the acquisition of donaldson lufkin  jenrette in  costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms costas had followed a similar approach in building out the ubs fixed income business hiring over  sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from us million in  to over us billion by  the arrival of former drexel burnham lambert investment banker ken moelis marked a major coup for costas moelis joined ubs from donaldson lufkin  jenrette in  shortly after its acquisition by credit suisse first boston although huw jenkins claimed he had hired moelis to the uk parliamentary banking commission while under oath which is patently false in his six years at ubs moelis ultimately assumed the role of president of ubs investment bank and was credited along with

ubs investment bankers moeliss departure was caused primarily by repeated conflict over the availability of capital from the banks balance sheet to pursue large transactions particularly leveraged buyouts the banks apparent conservatism would be turned on its head when large losses were reported in various mortgage securities rather than corporate loans that generated investment banking fees

was named chief executive officer nearly  of the top management positions were filled by legacy swiss bank professionals prior to the merger swiss bank corporation was considered to be further along than union bank of switzerland in developing its international investment banking business particularly in the higher margin advisory businesses where warburg dillon read was considered to be the more established platform union bank of switzerland had a stronger retail and commercial banking business in switzerland while both banks had strong asset management capabilities after the merger was

ultimately ubs was unable to sell or hedge its interest in ltcm as its value declined in the summer of  by november  ubss losses from its exposure to ltcm were estimated at the level of approximately chf  million ubs would prove to be the largest single loser in the ltcm collapse ultimately writing off chf  million the federal reserve bank of new york organized a bailout of us billion by the hedge funds major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets ubs contributed us million to the bailout effort which would largely be recovered in the aftermath of the ltcm collapse mathis cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of ubs along with three other executives following its involvement with ltcm ubs issued a statement given the developments in the international financial markets in
