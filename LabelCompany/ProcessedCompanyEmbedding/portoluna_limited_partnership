registers company portal law portal v t e a limited partnership lp is a form of partnership similar to a general partnership except that where a general partnership must have at least two general partners gps a limited partnership must have at least one gp and at least one limited partner the gps are in all major respects in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm ie they have management control share the right to use partnership property share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership as in a general partnership the gps have actual authority as agents of the firm to bind the partnership in contracts with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnerships business as with a general partnership an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnerships activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners contents  background of limited liability  history  concepts roots  regional variations  united states  united kingdom  japan  new zealand  germany  see also  references background of limited liabilityedit like shareholders in a corporation limited partners have limited liability this means that the limited partners have no management authority and unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guaranty are not liable for the debts of the partnership the limited partnership provides the limited partners a return on their investment similar to a dividend the nature and extent of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement general partners thus bear more economic risk than do limited partners and in cases of financial loss the gps will be the ones which are personally liable limited partners are subject to the same alterego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the limited partnership veil because limited partnerships do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the partnership and the members do not comingle funds it would be difficult to pierce the veil partnership interests including the interests of limited partners are afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtor’s share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed when the partnership is being constituted or the composition of the firm is changing limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant state registration office limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability it is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited hence unlike the gps the limited partners do not have inherent agency authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently held out as agents and so create an agency by estoppel or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority limited partnerships are distinct from limited liability partnerships in which all partners have limited liability in some jurisdictions the limited liability of the limited partners is contingent on their not participating in management historyedit the societates publicanorum which arose in rome in the third century bc may have arguably been the earliest form of limited partnership during the heyday of the roman empire they were roughly equivalent to todays corporations some had many investors and interests were publicly tradable however they required at least one and often several partners with unlimited liability concepts rootsedit according to jairus banaji the qirad and mudaraba institutions in islamic law and economic jurisprudence were similar to the modern limited partnership in medieval italy a business organization known as the commenda appeared in the th century that was generally used for financing maritime trade in a commenda the traveling trader of the ship had limited liability and was not held responsible if money was lost as long as the trader had not violated the rules of the contract in contrast his investment partners on land had unlimited liability and were exposed to risk a commenda was not a common form for a longterm business venture as most longterm businesses were still expected to be secured against the assets of their individual proprietors as an institution the commenda is very similar to the qirad but whether the qirad transformed into the commenda or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty colberts ordinance  and the napoleonic code  reinforced the limited partnership concept in european law in the united states limited partnerships became widely available in the early th century although a number of legal restrictions at the time made them unpopular for business ventures britain enacted

limited partnership lp is a form of partnership similar to a general partnership except that where a general partnership must have at least two general partners gps a limited partnership must have at least one gp and at least one limited partner the gps are in all major respects in the same legal position as partners in a conventional firm ie they have management control share the right to use partnership property share the profits of the firm in predefined proportions and have joint and several liability for the debts of the partnership as in a general partnership the gps have actual authority as agents of the firm to bind the partnership in contracts with third parties that are in the ordinary course of the partnerships business as with a general partnership an act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnerships activities or activities of the kind carried on by the limited partnership binds the limited partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners contents  background of limited liability  history  concepts roots  regional variations  united states  united kingdom  japan  new zealand  germany  see also  references background of limited liabilityedit like shareholders in a corporation limited partners have limited liability this means that the limited partners have no management authority and unless they obligate themselves by a separate contract such as a guaranty are not liable for the debts of the partnership the limited partnership provides the limited partners a return on their investment similar to a dividend the nature and extent of which is usually defined in the partnership agreement general partners thus bear more economic risk than do limited partners and in cases of financial loss the gps will be the ones which are personally liable limited partners are subject to the same alterego piercing theories as corporate shareholders however it is more difficult to pierce the limited partnership veil because limited partnerships do not have many formalities to maintain so long as the partnership and the members do not comingle funds it would be difficult to pierce the veil partnership interests including the interests of limited partners are afforded a significant level of protection through the charging order mechanism the charging order limits the creditor of a debtorpartner or a debtormember to the debtor’s share of distributions without conferring on the creditor any voting or management rightscitation needed when the partnership is being constituted or the composition of the firm is changing limited partnerships are generally required to file documents with the relevant state registration office limited partners must explicitly disclose their status when dealing with other parties so that such parties are on notice that the individual negotiating with them carries limited liability it is customary that the documentation and electronic materials issued to the public by the firm will carry a clear statement identifying the legal nature of the firm and listing the partners separately as general and limited hence unlike the gps the limited partners do not have inherent agency authority to bind the firm unless they are subsequently held out as agents and so create an agency by estoppel or acts of ratification by the firm create ostensible authority limited partnerships are distinct from limited liability partnerships in which all partners have limited liability in some jurisdictions the limited liability of the limited partners is contingent on their not participating in management historyedit the societates publicanorum which arose in rome in the third century bc may have arguably been the earliest form of limited partnership during the heyday of the roman empire they were roughly equivalent to todays corporations some had many investors and interests were publicly tradable however they required at least one and often several partners with unlimited liability concepts rootsedit according to jairus banaji the qirad and mudaraba institutions in islamic law and economic jurisprudence were similar to the modern limited partnership in medieval italy a business organization known as the commenda appeared in the th century that was generally used for financing maritime trade in a commenda the traveling trader of the ship had limited liability and was not held responsible if money was lost as long as the trader had not violated the rules of the contract in contrast his investment partners on land had unlimited liability and were exposed to risk a commenda was not a common form for a longterm business venture as most longterm businesses were still expected to be secured against the assets of their individual proprietors as an institution the commenda is very similar to the qirad but whether the qirad transformed into the commenda or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty colberts ordinance  and the napoleonic code  reinforced the limited partnership concept in european law in the united states limited partnerships became widely available in the early th century although a number of legal restrictions at the time made them unpopular for business ventures britain enacted its first limited partnership statute in  regional variationsedit for a list of types of corporation and other business types by country see types of business entity united statesedit in the united states the limited partnership organization is most common among film production companies and real estate investment projects or in types of businesses that focus on a single or limitedterm project they are also useful in laborcapital partnerships where one or more financial backers prefer to contribute money or resources while the other partner performs the actual work in such situations liability is the driving concern behind the choice of limited partnership status the limited partnership is also attractive to firms wishing to provide shares to many individuals without the additional tax liability of a corporation private equity companies almost exclusively use a combination of general and limited partners for their investment funds wellknown limited partnerships include enterprise products and blackstone group both of which are public companies and bloomberg lp a private company before  the limited liability enjoyed by limited partners was contingent upon their refraining from taking any active role in the management of the firm however section  of the revised uniform limited partnership act if adopted by a state legislature eliminates the socalled control rule with respect to personal liability for entity obligations and brings limited partners into parity with llc members llp partners and corporate shareholders the  amendments to the uniform limited partnership act to the extent the amendments are adopted by state legislature also permitted limited partnerships to become limited liability limited partnerships in states that adopt the change under this form debts of a limited liability limited partnership are solely the responsibility of the partnership thereby removing generalpartner liability for partnership obligations this change was made in response to the common practice of naming a limitedliability entity as a  general partner that controlled the limited partnership and organizing the managers as limited partners this practice granted a general partner de facto limited liability under the partnership structure united kingdomedit in the united kingdom limited partnerships are governed by the limited partnerships act  the uk department for business enterprise and regulatory reform now the department for business innovation and skills consulted in  on proposals to modify and merge the act with the partnership act  but the proposals did not go ahead and the  act remains the governing act english law and scottish law are distinct on partnerships in english law limited partnerships are not legally separate entities the partners are jointly and severally liable and any lawsuits filed are filed against the partners by name there has been discussion over whether limited partnerships operating under english law should be made separate legal entities in the same way as limited liability partnerships are the law commission report on partnership law lc suggested that creation of separate legal personality should be left as an option for the partners to decide upon when a partnership is formed there were concerns that automatically making partnerships separate legal entities would restrict their ability to trade in some european countries and also expose them to different tax regimes than expected japanedit japanese law has historically provided for two business forms similar to limited partnerships goshi gaisha a form of close corporation mochibun
