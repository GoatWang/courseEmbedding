gravitas can gloss over the fact that james bond has got a licence to sell and he will basically flog whatever he’s told to bond films now attract the same type of sponsorship as the world cup or the olympics skyfall had deals with cocacola sony ford omega procter  gamble and heineken but do these brands really get their money’s worth you’d think so considering the recent news that belvedere vodka has paid an undisclosed sum to be featured in the upcoming spectre it has already launched limitededition bottles with the mi building engraved on them and led lights inside them the film isn’t out for a year and already we’re talking about belvedere vodka so there is your marketing impact right there or rather right here but the real beneficiaries of the  touch are often the smaller brands that get a free ride in the movies heineken paid £m for the skyfall tiein for example but fans were horrified at the prospect of bond chugging beer even craig described the deal as “unfortunate” thus generating reams of negative publicity for which heineken then compensated with a carpetmarketing campaign – bombarding us with expensive commercials starring craig mobile apps branded bottles advertising in stores online in print and so on until nobody ever wanted to see a heineken bottle again bond obediently swigged the beer for one early scene but after that what did he drink macallan whisky so did judi dench and javier bardem and what did macallan pay for the privilege nothing at all macallan didn’t even ask to be in the movie – the filmmakers approached them according to one estimate macallan accounted for  of all productplacement screen time in skyfall which brought the company some m £m worth of exposure and doubtless cost a few heineken execs their jobs it’s the same with other bond accoutrements everyone knows bond’s weapon of choice a walther ppk bond has been its screentoscreen salesman for  years sean connery even presented a short documentary on walther guns in the s and yet the arms dealer pays nothing for the privilege – it was all thanks to ian fleming’s decision to equip bond with the gun back in  bond is happy to advertise other weapons too mind you in skyfall he also used an anderson wheeler shotgun and again the gunmakers paid nothing but they duly capitalised with a “skyfall edition”  rifle starting price around £ it’s amazing what bond gets away with selling alcohol firearms tobacco oil companies fast food he would probably do gm crops too if they could work it into the script but the truth is offduty he is an incorrigible shopaholic between missions he is scouring mayfair arcades and designer sample sales seeking to satiate his unchecked desire for luxury items if you are a purveyor of such goods you are in with a good chance of some free publicity it seems but let’s not forget who is really footing the bill for this government employeeturnedrogue consumer why do you think we have a deficit problem topics james bond product

other uncategorized the best tv shows newsletter about editor contact and advertising press search product placement in pictures skyfallnovember  in moviesby erik a lot has been written about excessive and blatant product placement in the latest bond movie skyfall but let me say somethingdifferent product placement in skyfall wasn’t excessive and wasn’t blatant actually it was more subtle than i’ve expected mind you we’re still talking about james bond movie so there is a lot of products and brands integrated in the movie but skyfall is no transformers or some other examples of product placement prostitution when the information about heineken’s  million deal roughly a third of skyfall’s production budget first surfaced there were numerous articles and blog posts about james bond selling out we have to be honest though all bond’s movies had product placement some were more subtle and some were more blatant when it comes to brand integration also david leigh who runs website the james bond dossier said that bond has consumed a wide variety of beverages from the start in both in his literary and cinematic incarnations so what’s the fuss first let’s check products and brands from skyfall possible spoilers cars landrover audi beetle range rover jaguar and aston martin landrover defender and audi were seen in a car chase scene eve drove landrover while the bad guys tried to escape in audi during the chase a few vw beetles fell from the train range rover was used to transport bond to mi’s new location and m and bond used jaguar xj the legendary aston martin db also made an important appearance but i won’t reveal why  aston martin db from skyfall sony skyfall was produced by metrogoldwynmayer and columbia pictures columbia pictures is owned by sony pictures entertainment so the appearance of different sony products should not be a coincidence i have reviewed several movies distributed by sony pictures and probably all of them included sony’s brands bond or was it q used sony vaio laptop first seen in casino royale and sony xperia t mobile phone nothing special or excessive there only vaio’s logo and a glimpse of the new xperia sony vaio from skyfall  mgm and columbia pictures screen capture macallan whisky macallan whisky was probably the most “in your face” placement it occurred during the first meeting between bond and silva the main villain offered james a drink a year old macallan because it’s his favorite drink additionally we saw m and bond drinking macallan on two different occasions macallan whisky on the desk from skyfall  mgm and columbia pictures screen capture heineken the much hyped heineken appeared in two scenes bond was lying in bed with a girl and we could see a bottle of heineken in his hand the other appearance was in a big office tanner one of mi employees was sipping beer from heineken bottle that’s it nothing excessive heineken in skyfall omega we know that bond wears omega but i couldn’t recognize his watch anyway he wore a seamaster model omega seamaster from skyfall  mgm and columbia pictures screen capture tom ford james bond has been wearing tom ford for the second time similar as with omega you can’t recognize the brand of his clothes – the fact that we know what he wears is just matter of cleveraggressive marketing campaigns bond also wore tom ford marko tf sunglasses you can read more about james bond’s clothing in the excellent blog post at clothes on film tom ford marko tf sunglasses from skyfall source filmofiliacom walther ppk walther ppk pistol is a longtime bond companion but in skyfall q introduced an improved gun with a thumbprint code walther ppk from skyfall  mgm and columbia pictures screen capture the verdict rd bond movie is very good even though casino royale remains my personal favorite skyfall is an improvement over quantum of solace also daniel craig’s movies are vastly superior to brosnan’s dalton’s and moore’s bond is now more human and not a cartoon that would become if pierce brosnan stayed in his role product placement used to be synonymous for bond movies and has to be analyzed with that fact in mind all bond movies have got excessive product placement but bond was also a sexist he delivered amusing onelines the majority of bond girls had stupid names christmas jones pussy galore … … to name just a few of bond’s trademarks with everything taken into account product placement in skyfall was nicely done there’s absolutely nothing wrong with it and i hope people will stop complaining about it do you agree   there are more pictures of brands from skyfall in the blog post product placement slideshow skyfall and on brands  films facebook page   aston martin fashion heineken jaguar james bond omega sony tom ford  comments slavisa

rather needless close up of the omega as bond operated the caterpillar diggar and tanner drinking beer in the office was pretty unlikely if mi has gone the way of most british workplaces but overall i agree with you erik november th   thanks tom i usually write blog posts after i watch a movie at home but this time i went to the cinema and began writing the next day i hoped i’d remember every brand in skyfall but i guess i failed  raquel williams december th   there was also adidas bond wore these in the fitness test scene personally i think the product placement in this film was tasteful and subtle save for the vw brand the beetle scene was a bit much dl july th   most people don’t notice and don’t care about product placement we see those products every day in real life just like we see them in movies it makes me wonder exactly how much the manufacturers increase sales by this as opposed to how much it costs them to do it eric november th   regarding omega again for a second it’s also worth noting that there is another example of very subtle product placement it’s almost subliminal during bond’s pursuit of silva in the subway there is an instance where silva passes up two posters for omega one for the seamaster planet ocean and another seamaster model i believe i saw skyfall for the first time last night and picked up on this almost immediately very cleverly played add
