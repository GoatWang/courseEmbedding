been moderated by mnt staff little help posted by jeremy on  sep  at  am i have these and my sex life is still great all i do is inform the partner before hand about how there not contagious not a disease or sti and are fairly common among men however if it is one of those heat of the moment as long as they dont get full look at it and you go straight to sex then it should be fine i just make sure they get something else  so they dont put any attention on it if the women is still not comfortable with it then move on you just have to grit your teeth when you tell them hoping they dont laugh and tell the world but most girls i have been with have been fine with it and fairly mature about it reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff cure posted by nelly on  sep  at  pm i know exactly how to treat this im  and i had fordyce a few weeks ago the best way to cure this is stop using lip products instead of using lip products use vicks vaporub apply it whenever the lips get dry literally all the time for  or more days then bam lips are back to normal what vicks does is it removes the dead skin and forms new one therefore when the dead skin comes off the rash also comes off reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff no worries fordyce spots posted by shyncoral on  oct  at  am actually i wanted to let you know that it is okay i

friday night i had sex with my girlfriend i used protection and was extremely careful like always and after i took the condom off i have a tiny bump on the lower shaft of my penis no pain no nothing just a bump it looks like the other small little normal dots that every gender gets but its bigger then them please help reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff fordyce and you posted by paul on  dec  at  pm yup im one of those unfortunate bs with fordyce spots on his upper lip theres a rather obvious cluster just left of center and a prominent one to the right with the smaller suckers in various other spots ou l yes they cause mental torture being unable to confidently smile in anyones direction without feeling like they notice the spots but lets banish that idea immediately for starters personally no one has really noticed or at least havent mentioned them to me you must realize if theyre just as human as we are their mind will most likely be focused on their own facesmilelook while really only taking in the big picture of yours if you folks are like me you cant even notice them yourself until you lean in toward the mirror and stretch your lips thin against your teeth and if you plan to approach a woman in this manner fordyce spots are your smallest concern on your game besides i know it doesnt help much as were all guilty of being shallow to some point with the rare and few exceptions but we shouldnt be focused on finding a partner in our lives that values us for our looks we should hold out for that person that values our minds our love our company and our spirit as far as a cure ill try the lemon juice idea for a week and report back meanwhile ive also heard from a show that crushing aspirin up and mixing it with water will work however they also poked the spots with a sterilized needle i tried getting them first with a needle but was only successful in drawing a very tiny bit of blood and im a wuss so i just made the mixture of two aspirin and water on a spoon made a sort of paste and put that on my lip rubbing it in for a bit but not rubbing it completely off id start with a little more than half the paste and rub that in around until it lost its moisture then i put the rest on i let it sit for a half an hour before i washed it off with cold water ill be totally honest only after one treatment this very morning i noticed a rather noticable reduction ill do the same tomorrow and ill report back together if youre as cheap and adventurous as i am well figure these little monsters out and for goodness sake stop moping some girls arent so shallow and that goes the same for you females waiting on a man yes these are a pain in the ass and its gonna take time or otherwise never go away but im holding onto hope in the meantime be thankful you have legs and can still walk be happy it isnt an incurable disease that renders you bed sick these fordyce spots are a bitch but lets consider ourselves lucky as they pale in comparison to what some others struggle with on a day to day basis and dont be afraid to talk about it you may just find your long lost love suffers from the same thing mentally and you can both realize how silly it was that the other thought that such a small facial oddity would ever keep you from loving them reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff dont worry so much posted by chris on  jan  at  pm i have had fordyce spots on my penis as long as i can remember yes they make me a little selfconscious to the point where i dont like when people stare at my penis in full light i was also afraid of getting blowjobs before but that quickly changed when i noticed that whenever i had sex or got a blowjob the girl didnt notice or she didnt care i have been sexually active for  years now and have had sex probably  times and with around  different girls and not once have i had a bad reaction ive sometimes even showed them the spots just to see how they felt about them and everyone ive showed them to have had no problem with it and most of the time weve had sex again and theyve had no problem giving me a blowjob after moral of the story dont be too selfconsious about it most people dont even care especially if you just tell them that its not like an std or anything i still dont like it at all and i check a couple times a year around the internet for a definate cure but other than that ive made my peace with it reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff  percent of girls dont care posted by andree on  jan  at  pm i have had sex with  girls and not even one complained about them as a matter of fact one of them once told me they felt as good as a ribbed condom my fiancé did notice them but does not care at all women find confidence attractive therefore your self consciousness will be a x more of a turn off than uniform little bumps on your junk if i were you i will spend more time learning how to please women and taking care of my body ie eating healthy working out dressing well grooming etcthan dealing with the spots btw porn wont teach you anything useful reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has

noticed them when i was  and couldnt make any sense of them at  i got it checked out only to find out there is nothing i can do but hold out and hope that they go away alas they are still there and have got worse very gradually while i am thankful that they are not contagious i wish that there was a good method to get rid of them permanently i am telling my girlfriend about them tonight which is some scary sht but i think it will go ok just got to man up reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff fordyce posted by andrew s on  feb  at  pm what doctor did you see

finally i found it tonight that its  fordyce spot although i have a gp and she is a women so now i can discuss with her and will see what she would advice me reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff try pure jojoba oil for fordyce posted by la on  mar  at  pm hi all i randomly developed fordyce spots on my lips a couple of years back i did lots of research on the internet and found that jojoba oil helps to minimize fordyce spots ive been using it for the last couple years and its the best option out there out of everything i have tried in fact i stopped getting them all over my lips for a while i now only get a very small cluster on the bottom of my top lip where the top and bottom lips meet i recently had an outbreak while i was traveling and didnt have my oil but they dried up and i am now back to normal i recommend using the oil every morning and every night in a few days youll start to see the difference and over time youll see that jojoba oil really helps to diminish the fordyce outbreaks good luck reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff fordyce spots posted by vakarian on  mar  at  pm to all of those saying that the spots arent a big deal and then saying you have them on your penis its a lot different when you have them on your lips as you dont walk around naked where everyone can see your penis but everyone can always see your lips i have had these spots on my penis for years and never cared but they have recently started to form on my lips and thats just embarrassing when you feel that someones just staring at your lips wondering if its contagious reply ﹘ alert a moderator this opinion has been moderated by mnt staff i am shy to go out because of spots on lips posted by shygirl on
