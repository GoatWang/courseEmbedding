this case turns on the jurisdictional reach of federal courts when both statebased and federalbased claims are put at issue in a complaint plaintiffs appeal from a decision on the merits rendered in favor of all defendants by the united states district court for the southern district of texas plaintiffs originally filed their complaint in the district court of harris county th judicial district a texas state court against fifteen different defendants asserting a variety of statelaw claims as well as one for patent infringement defendants asserting their right under  usc §  removed the case to federal court the federal district court subsequently granted defendants motions for summary judgment on the merits holding that the claims were barred either by relevant state statutes of limitations or in the case of the patent infringement claim by laches plaintiffs took an appeal to the fifth circuit which court denied defendants motion to dismiss and transferred the appeal to this court  the merits of the summary judgment were briefed and presented to this court at oral argument however at the argument we raised with counsel the question of whether the case was properly in federal court at all or whether jurisdiction lay exclusively in state court we suspended further consideration of the merits pending additional briefing on the question of jurisdiction the fact that none of the parties raised the issue or that none of the other courts hearing the matter considered it is not determinative federal courts are courts of defined jurisdiction and a court must attend to its jurisdiction at all times  having now fully considered the additional briefs and the questions thereunder we conclude albeit reluctantly that neither the district court nor this court has jurisdiction over the causes of action pled by plaintiffs the matter belongs if it belongs anywhere in an appropriate state court the judgment of the district court is vacated and the matter remanded to that court with instructions to return the cause to the state court whence it came background  plaintiff james f arnold is an inventor he patented a number of inventions covering devices used in the connection and repair of subsea oil pipelines and offshore platforms beginning in  arnold became involved in a number of agreements that related to these patents in some of which he was a contracting party and in some of which he was not but which related to the patents and rights arising under them the story is somewhat convoluted but necessary to an understanding of who the parties are and the nature of the dispute between them  arnold entered into an employment agreement with hydrotech services inc hts on march   under this agreement arnold agreed to assign his rights to technology he developed during the term of his employment this agreement excluded any invention developed before march   however and specifically excluded certain issued patents  subsequently on august   arnold entered into an agreement with hydrotech international inc hti a newlyformed holding company and the successor in interest to hts pursuant to this agreement arnold assigned all his rights in any invention innovation or improvement developed during the term of the agreement to hti except for certain patents the same ones that were excluded from the hts agreement and patent applications arising before arnolds employment with hts in return hti covenanted inter alia to pay a royalty to arnold on all tools sold by hti that were either invented by arnold or covered by his patents later on december   arnold and hti entered into two assignment agreements in which arnold assigned certain patents to hti including two of the patents that had been excluded from the earlier agreements  thereafter in  hughes tool company hughes tool informed arnold that it desired to purchase hti that same year hughes tool effected this purchase through its whollyowned subsidiary hughes undersea couplings inc hughes undersea in this acquisition hughes undersea received all of htis assets including the patents that hti had acquired from arnold on october   arnold entered into an agreement with hughes undersea the  agreement which was designed to supersede other agreements including the agreement entered into on august   and the two assignment agreements entered into on december   the  agreement stated that arnold agreed to an assignment presumably from hti of the various patents to hughes undersea  the  agreement contained a provision allowing either party arnold or hughes undersea to assign the agreement to another party this provision further provided that hughes undersea could assign any of the patents or patent applications covered by the agreement to a third party provided that it notified arnold of such assignment within ten days pursuant to this provision on december   hughes tool acting through hughes undersea assigned its rights in particular patents and patent applications to caldive international inc caldive arnold was notified of the assignment on december   caldive later assigned all of its rights to hsi acquisition inc which later changed its name to hydrotech systems inc and made the necessary notification to arnold on august    finally in october  arnold sold his corporation the jim arnold corporation to earl e ennis ennis in connection with this sale arnold assigned to ennis all of his rights in the patents developed by him and any rights he had in agreements with hti hughes tool caldive and hsi acquisition inchydrotech systems  thus as of the date of the texas state court action in august of  as a result of the chain of transactions and assignments outlined above hydrotech systems inc apparently owned the relevant patents while any interests that remained with arnold following the  and  agreements along with his rights under the various agreements apparently were owned by ennis  in the following discussion the plaintiffs will be designated collectively as arnold and referred to in the singular the defendants may sometimes be referred to as hughes the defendants not named above are not involved in the claims regarding the  agreement but are in the suit based on other theories our disposition regarding jurisdiction applies to all the claims raised and therefore we need not differentiate among these defendants  as noted plaintiff arnold in  filed its complaint in a texas state court asserting both state and federal claims defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of texas under the provisions of  usc §  on the theory that the case was one which arose in whole or in part under the patent laws of the united states and therefore original and exclusive jurisdiction lay in the federal district court pursuant to  usc §  the record does not indicate that plaintiff opposed the transfer plaintiff did oppose the judgment eventually awarded by the district court however that court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants all counts except the patent infringement count were ruled in favor of the several defendants on the basis of various texas statutes of limitations the patent count was ruled in favor of the defendants on the ground of laches  plaintiff appealed from that judgment to the fifth circuit since the presumed basis for federal court jurisdiction was §  the appeal properly lay in this court the fifth circuit declined defendants motion to dismiss the appeal and transferred the matter to this court discussion a  before we may reach the merits of a case we must as a threshold issue attend to our jurisdiction this case is here on removal at the trial level from the state court in which plaintiff placed it unless expressly provided otherwise by statute a civil action brought in a state court may be removed to a federal district court but only if a federal district court could have exercised original jurisdiction over the cause  usc §   see eg caterpillar inc v williams  us    s ct    l ed d   only statecourt actions that originally could have been filed in federal court may be removed to federal court by the defendant the question we must answer therefore is whether federal subjectmatter jurisdiction would exist over this case had it originally been filed in federal court if the answer is yes then removal was proper and the matter is before us on the merits if the answer is no then removal was improper and federal courts are without jurisdiction to determine the cause   usc §  states that the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states  usc § a  whether the case originally could have been heard under §  depends on whether the plaintiffs in a wellpleaded complaint state a claim which arises under the patent law a claim arises under the patent law if patent law creates the cause of action or is a necessary element of one of the wellpleaded claims christianson v colt indus operating corp  us    s ct    l ed d   this is not a case in which patent law is a necessary element of some other wellpleaded claim thus if federal jurisdiction exists it is because patent law created a cause of action  the seemingly simple phrase arising under has engendered litigation and argument for at least a century schwarzkopf dev corp v ticoating  fd    uspq bna   fedcir justice holmes stated the rule to be that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action american well works co v layne  bowler co  us    s ct    l ed   though this may not be a selfevident prescription case law gives us considerable guidance into what the phrase means in the context of a case such as this  the right of a patentee to a remedy for patent infringement is created by the patent statute which provides that a patentee shall have remedy by civil action for infringement of his patent  usc §   the term patentee includes successors in title to the patent  usc § d  to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court under §  it is necessary that plaintiff allege facts that demonstrate that he and not the defendant owns the patent rights on which the infringement suit is premised furthermore this allegation of ownership must have a plausible foundation federal jurisdiction cannot lie based on allegations that are frivolous or insubstantial see cervantez v bexar county civil service commn  fd   th cir thus if plaintiff cannot in good faith allege such facts because absent judicial intervention to change the situation under the terms of a contract or deed of assignment the rights at issue are held by the defendant federal court is not the place to seek that initial judicial intervention  it may seem strange at first blush that the question of whether a patent is valid and infringed ordinarily is one for federal courts while the question of who owns the patent rights and on what terms typically is a question exclusively for state courts yet that long has been the law it is well settled that if the patentee pleads a cause of action based on rights created by a contract or on the common law of torts the case is not one arising under the patent laws see eg new marshall engine co v marshall engine co  us   s ct   l ed   state court has jurisdiction of suit for specific performance of contract to assign patent geneva furniture mfg co v s karpen bros  us   s ct   l ed   upholding federal jurisdiction over part of a bill charging contributory infringement rest of bill not sustainable because based on contract becher v contoure labs inc  us   s ct   l ed   explaining why state court has jurisdiction over bill to compel assignment of a patent tortiously secured by patentee see also schwarzkopf development corp v ticoating inc  fd   uspq bna  fedcir beghinsay intl inc v olebendt rasmussen  fd   uspq bna  fedcir see also christianson v colt indus operating corp  fd    uspqd   fedcir vacated on jurisdictional grounds and remanded  us   s ct   l ed d   uspqd    plaintiff arnold contends that his complaint to the state court clearly showed that he had assigned all right title and interest in the patents at issue to hughes that he had no ownership interest in the patents on which to sue unless and until the stateprovided remedy of rescission was granted and that his causes of action thus lay exclusively in state court defendants in support of the district courts decree in their favor argue that plaintiffs original petition contains a wellpleaded claim for patent infringement under  usc §  and that the need to decide a question of contract law prior to reaching the infringement question does not defeat federal subjectmatter jurisdiction  for the reasons we shall explain we reluctantly come to the conclusion that plaintiff is correct and that federal jurisdiction does not lie over the causes of action pleaded by arnold in his original petition filed in the state court of harris county we say reluctantly because judicial economy would suggest that plaintiff has had his day in court with regard to an initial determination of his claims at the trial level and that the correctness of that determination is now a matter of appellate review of its merits nor does plaintiff have much in the way of equities in his favor although defendants brought this problem upon themselves by initiating the removal of the case to federal court plaintiff apparently did nothing to resist the removal and did not even bother to raise the jurisdiction issue here on appeal though plaintiff thus may have no claim on our sympathies and though the result of a trial in state court may replicate the result reached by the federal district court considerations of judicial economy cannot trump a clear rule of law particularly one that goes to the very power of the court to decide the case b  plaintiffs complaint filed in the district court of harris county texas denominated plaintiffs original petition consists of twenty numbered parts containing  numbered paragraphs fifteen different defendants corporate and individual were named in part i in part ii headed jurisdiction and venue the jurisdictional paragraph paragraph  states that this court the harris county court has jurisdiction pursuant to article  of the tex civ prac  remcode ann because is sic involves contracts with a texas resident to be performed in part in this state and torts committed in part in this state the complaint then recites a series of background facts identifies the patents which were the subject of the several agreements described above and alleges inter alia the failures of the defendants to perform according to the terms of the agreements  the complaint then pleads with respect to the named defendants causes of action for various statebased claims part iv entitled fraud misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment contains paragraphs alleging that defendants deliberately made false representations of material fact regarding actual sales and other aspects of the agreements on which plaintiff relied part v entitled breach of fiduciary duties contains paragraphs alleging that defendants as a result of the assignments had a confidential or fiduciary relationship with plaintiff which by their conduct was breached part vi entitled breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing alleges that as an alternative to the fiduciary obligations defendants by acquiring an interest in plaintiffs patents and inventions had a duty of good faith and fair dealing again breached by their failure to properly account under the assignments part vii entitled tortious interference with contractual or business relations alleges that defendants knowing of the royalty obligations contained in the agreements conspired together to encourage breaches of those obligations part viii mislabeled vii entitled civil conspiracy alleges that defendants conspired to prevent plaintiff from receiving the royalties due under the licensing agreements part ix entitled constructive fraud alleges that the conduct as described in the prior paragraphs constitutes constructive fraud and part x entitled breach of contract contains paragraphs alleging that defendants actions in nonpayment of royalties due plaintiff constitutes breach of the assignment contracts  following the substantive allegations there is a part entitled rescission part xi in this section plaintiff based on the wrongs previously alleged seeks inter alia a judgment rescinding the contract assigning patents to defendants and requiring all defendants to reassign all right title and interest to said patents to plaintiffs paragraph  plaintiff states that since the contract between plaintiffs and defendants has been void since on or before  plaintiffs seek recision sic of the contracts assigning patents by hughes tool company to caldive inc diversified energies inc to hsi acquisition inc as defendants had no interest to assign paragraph  plaintiff further seeks judgment from the court requiring defendants to reassign all right title and interest in the patents paragraph   this section is followed by part xii entitled patent infringement in numbered paragraph  plaintiff alleges that alteratively sic since the agreements assigning the patents from plaintiffs to defendants has sic been null and void since at least  said defendants are and have been infringing upon plaintiffs patents  in direction violation of  uwc sic  et seq since that date in two subsequent paragraphs plaintiff alleges that the infringement was willful and that unless restrained it would continue  the remainder of the complaint contains claims for accounting part xiii and damages parts xivxvi including damages for actual damages mental anguish damages and exemplary damages arising from the various contractual breaches and other alleged wrongs in one of the paragraphs on actual damages plaintiff states alternatively in the event this court grants plaintiffs requested recision sic of the  assignment agreement or other agreements plaintiffs will be entitled to recover for defendants continuing acts of patent infringement paragraph  a later paragraph asks for treble damages for willful infringement in the event this court grants plaintiffs requested recision sic of the  assignment contract paragraph  after other miscellaneous paragraphs the complaint ends with a prayer for all damages due as permitted by law  viewed in its entirety the complaint leaves no doubt that plaintiffs suit is premised on a statelaw based set of claims arising out of an alleged breach of an assignment and royalty agreement plaintiffs repeated reference to the need for rescission of the assignment agreement and the desired legal consequences that would flow from a decree of rescission point inexorably to the fact that his claim is a claim for a contract wrong inclusion in the complaint of the statement the agreements assigning the patents from plaintiffs to defendants has sic been null and void since at least  does not change the clear gravamen of the complaint at best that statement is a conclusion of law based on plaintiffs assumption about what the facts will prove it falls far short of the necessary wellpleaded allegation of ownership of patent rights the very rights which are the subject of the dispute  when fully analyzed the complaint can only be read to say that in order for the federal district court to reach the patent infringement claim it first must resolve the ownership interests resulting from the long and convoluted chain of transactions and assignments therein outlined in addition the court would have to determine whether as a matter of contract remedy to rescind the assignments based on arnolds various claims of contract wrongs assuming that the district court decided that the relevant assignments should be rescinded and that arnold should be declared the owner of the patents only then could it reach the patent infringement issue c  defendants argue that under the law as it is understood today that is precisely what the federal district court is to do and in so doing the court does not transgress its jurisdictional limits to understand the evolving history as defendants see it we must go back almost a century and a half to a supreme court case decided in   in wilson v sandford  us  how   l ed   plaintiff filed his bill in the circuit court of the united states for the district of louisiana he alleged infringement of his patent and sought an injunction prohibiting further use of his machine by defendants he further alleged that he had earlier given a license to defendants permitting them to use his patented machine but that the license was expressly conditioned on their making the specified payments if the payments were not made as specified the license provided that any rights granted thereunder would revert to the plaintiff patentee  plaintiff alleged that since the payments were not made as specified the patent reverted to him and he thus was suing for a declaration and for an injunction the supreme court held that there was no jurisdiction under the patent act the injunction he asks for is to be the consequence of the decree of the court sanctioning the forfeiture that is a contract dispute not a patent law dispute said the court  wilson set the stage for luckett v delpark inc  us   s ct   l ed   in luckett plaintiff luckett entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with defendant delpark inc a license later made exclusive by a supplemental agreement allegedly delpark failed to pay luckett royalties under the agreement and luckett brought suit in federal district court in his complaint among other contentions luckett asserted that delpark was infringing his patents luckett requested inter alia that the license be canceled and that delpark be enjoined from continuing to make and deliver the alleged infringing articles the district court dismissed lucketts suit for lack of jurisdiction and the supreme court affirmed in reaching its decision the court reviewed at length the case law dealing with distinguishing cases that arise under the patent laws thus conferring federal subject matter jurisdiction from cases in which construction or enforcement of a contract or license is the issue cases in which subject matter jurisdiction lies not in federal courts but in state courts the court summarized its understanding of the law thusly  where a patentee complainant makes his suit one for recovery of royalties under a contract of license or assignment or for damages for a breach of its covenants or for a specific performance thereof or asks the aid of the court in declaring a forfeiture of the license or in restoring an unclouded title to the patent he does not give the federal district court jurisdiction of the cause as one arising under the patent laws nor may he confer it in such a case by adding to his bill an averment that after the forfeiture shall be declared or the title to the patent shall be restored he fears the defendant will infringe and therefore asks for an injunction to prevent it that was wilson v sandford sic if in that case the patentee complainant had based his action on his patent right and had sued for infringement and by anticipation of a defense of the assignment had alleged a forfeiture by his own declaration without seeking aid of the court jurisdiction under the patent laws would have attached and he would have had to meet the claim by the defendant that forfeiture of the license or assignment and restoration of title could not be had except by a decree of a court which if sustained would have defeated his prayer for an injunction on the merits but when the patentee exercises his choice and bases his action on the contract and seeks remedies thereunder he may not give the case a double aspect so to speak and make it a patent case conditioned on his securing equitable relief as to the contract  luckett  us at   sct at  emphasis added  more recently this court in air products and chemicals inc v reichhold chemicals inc  fd  fedcir relied heavily on the ratio decidendi expressed in luckett and cited extensively to the cases reviewed there in air products patentee air products granted a nonexclusive license to a party who later assigned its rights under the license to defendant reichhold id at  the license agreement contained a termination clause upon which air products allegedly relied in terminating reichholds license id air products alleged that subsequent to the termination reichhold started infringing and continued to infringe air products patent id air products filed suit against reichhold in federal district court predicating jurisdiction on section  id the district court read the complaint as primarily stating a claim sounding in contract involving construction of the license as a consequence the court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  on appeal this court reviewed the state of the law as set forth in luckett the court then stated that a court must review and analyze the plaintiffs pleadings with special attention directed to the relief requested by the plaintiff in making the determination as to whether a cause of action arises under the patent laws or is a cause of action based upon a licensing agreement id at   its review of the pleadings led the court to conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint the court noted that air products averred that it had unilaterally terminated the license agreement as it was entitled to do that as a result it was the owner of the patent in suit and that reichhold was infringing the patent which air products owned the fact that the question of whether the termination was proper remained in the case and that air products asked the trial court for a declaration of its full ownership of the patent arguably undercut its position the court nevertheless concluded that under the facts alleged it was not necessary for the patentee to first seek statelaw forfeiture of the license before bringing its patent suit the court thus distinguished earlier cases in which the patentees prior license presumptively still in effect was held to bar federal jurisdiction  defendants citing kunkel v topmaster intl inc  fd   uspqd  fedcir argue that the fact that a statelaw question must be decided as a precondition to a patent law question does not work to automatically deny jurisdiction in kunkel as in air products this court was called upon to decide whether a claim for patent infringement when coupled with claims seeking rescission of a license and other relief states a claim within the purview of the federal court or only within that of a state court as in air products the district court had dismissed kunkels suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction this court reversed stating that the patentee had adequately pled ownership of a patent still in force and infringement by defendants the court noted that a federal court is not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction when a plaintiff bases his claim upon and seeks remedies under the patent laws even though the complaint also anticipates a defense of license and thus puts the license question in issue id at   defendants reliance on air products and kunkel is misplaced to determine whether section  jurisdiction attaches the court must look to see whether the plaintiff has stated in a wellpleaded complaint a claim arising under the patent laws vink v schijf  fd    uspqd   fedcir the well pleaded complaint rule contemplates that the answer to whether an action arises under federal law must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiffs statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose  id quoting franchise tax bd of cal v construction laborers vacation trust for southern cal  us    s ct    l ed d   furthermore we have stated that the court must consider as a whole the substance of the claim in addition to the language of the complaint and may also consider jurisdictional facts outside the pleadings air products  fd at   uspq at   in this case viewing the complaint in its entirety we are left with the conclusion that plaintiffs suit is premised on a statelaw based set of claims arising out of alleged breaches of the assignment agreements essentially the entire complaint is directed to causes of action based on various statebased claims moreover plaintiff repeatedly refers to the need for rescission of the assignment agreements as indicated by paragraphs  and  of the complaint which request rescission and by paragraph  in which plaintiff states that in the event the trial court grants plaintiffs requested recision sic of the  assignment agreement and other agreements plaintiffs will be entitled to recover for defendants continuing acts of patent infringement these references point inexorably to the fact that the claim is one for a contract wrong see eg beghinsay intl inc v rasmussen  fd    uspq bna   fedcir schwarzkopf dev corp v ticoating inc  fd    uspq bna   fedcir  the sole possible basis for finding federal jurisdiction under section  is found in paragraph  of the complaint there plaintiff states that because the agreements assigning the patents from plaintiffs to defendants has sic been null and void since at least  said defendants are and have been infringing upon plaintiffs patents as enumerated in paragraph  in direct violation of  uwc sic  et seq since that date however this statement does not change the clear gravamen of the complaint moreover as explained below standing alone the statement fails to present a nonfrivolous allegation of ownership of the patents federal subject matter jurisdiction cannot attach based on frivolous allegations  while wilson luckett air products and kunkel all involved license agreements the present case involves an assignment licenses are considered as nothing more than a promise by the licensor not to sue the licensee spindelfabrik suessenschurr v schubert  salzer  fd    uspqd   fedcir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   and title to the patent does not change hands under a license agreement however assignments pass title to the patentees rights with all the accompanying rights of ownership from the patentee to the assignee see chisum patents § ab at  to   ortho pharmaceutical corp v genetics institute inc  fd   fedcir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   green v le clair  fd   th cir citing rude v westcott  us    s ct    l ed    therefore in the case of a license agreement having a rescission clause a patentee in a suit for infringement can properly assert that it owned the patent at the time of infringement and that the defendant is infringing the patent see eg air products  fd at  in such cases the plaintiff does not seek any specific equitable relief as a prerequisite to bringing the infringement claim id thus the district court can treat defendants claim of a license as a defense to the assertion that he is infringing and the court can decide that issue first as a matter of efficient management of the trial as we stated in air products  we recognize that in cases where a license is plead as a defense or where the license defense is anticipated in the complaint that the most expeditious conduct of the trial would necessitate that the license issue be resolved first for if the license issue is resolved in the defendants favor the infringement issue is mooted a district court  is not precluded in patent suits from resolving nonpatent questions and the fact that a question of contract law must be decided prior to reaching the infringement question does not defeat federal subject matter jurisdiction  air products  fd at   uspq at   however when the infringement suit involves an assignment unless the assignment may be declared null and void by operation of laweither through a forfeiture provision present in the agreement or under a provision of applicable state lawan assignor suing for infringement must first affirmatively seek equitable relief from a court to rescind or cancel the assignment until ownership is restored in the assignor there can be no act of infringement by the assignee federal question jurisdiction must exist at the time the complaint is filed for a federal court to exercise authority over the case keene corp v united states  us    s ct    l ed d   and without first receiving equitable relief that restores to the assignor title to the patent any claim of ownership by the assignor will be unfounded further because an action to rescind or cancel an assignment is a statelaw based claim see ausherman v stump  fd   th cir absent diversity jurisdiction it is to a state court that plaintiffs must look in seeking a forfeiture of the license air products  fd at   uspq at  see wilson  us  how at  luckett  us at   sct at   defendants put heavy reliance on kunkel and argue that consequently wilson and luckett are no longer good law it is true that kunkel states that wilson and luckett were based on a distinction between law and equity a distinction no longer applicable on account of the merger of law and equity courts by the federal rules of civil procedure of  kunkel  fd at  a close reading of the two supreme court cases however indicates that the result reached in those cases was not dependent on the existence of a distinction between causes of action at law and those in equity indeed as the quote above from luckett demonstrates the court included both causes of action at law for damages and causes of action in equity for specific performance in the same sentence and treated them alike in terms of the issue discussed whatever has been the consequence of the formal merger of law and equity in federal courts in terms of the manner of pleading and the power of a federal judge to grant both types of remedies the distinction between law and equity has continued viability today not the least in terms of theory underlying causes of action and availability of certain kinds of remedies the merger was of courts and process not underlying theories of claims and relief the result in kunkel is fully consistent with supreme court authority defendants use of it is not  in this case the assignment agreements specifically invoke texas law which governs the contractual rights and obligations of the parties minco inc v combustion engg inc  fd   fedcir in the state court complaint plaintiff asserted that due to defendants breaches of the assignments the assignments had become null and void thereby reestablishing ownership of the patents in plaintiff arnold in essence plaintiff alleged that the defendants actions had caused a forfeiture of the assignments however there is no forfeiture language in any of the agreements thus the agreements do not recite conditions subsequent upon the occurrence of which forfeiture takes place  as far as texas law generally is concerned we have found no authority to support the proposition that following a breach of the assignments the plaintiff could unilaterally declare the agreements null and void and thereby reobtain ownership of the patents that are covered by the assignments yet that is precisely what plaintiff asserts in paragraph  of the complaint texas case law indicates that a party must seek the aid of a court in order to obtain cancellation or rescission of an assignment thus obtaining reassignment of title see eg humphrey v camelot retirement community  swd   texapp stating that a trial court may grant rescission and that the decision to grant rescission lies within its sound discretion owens v ridgeway  swd   texcivapp noting that plaintiff brought suit to cancel and rescind certain assignment agreements district courts plainly do not have patent law jurisdiction over these kinds of actions under section  see schwarzkopf dev corp v ticoating inc  fd    uspq bna   fedcir paragraph  of the state court complaint fails to present a nonfrivolous allegation of ownership of the patents at issue sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the district court pursuant to  usc §   this case is a classic example of the importance of precise phrasing in a legal document and the phrasing in a complaint is the plaintiffs phrasing as this court in air products so aptly reminded  the party who brings suit is master to decide what law he will rely upon the fair v kohler die  specialty co  us    s ct    l ed   and that jurisdiction generally depends upon the case made and the relief demanded by the plaintiff healy v sea gull specialty co  us    s ct    l ed   air products  fd at   the anomalous pleading in this case of an inadequate patent claim in the midst of a contractbased law suit has resulted in a substantial waste of judicial and litigant resources the remedy for that however is not an equally unfounded assumption of jurisdiction given the clear guidance of the supreme court and of this courts precedents there can be no doubt that the case brought by arnold did not arise under the patent laws see christianson v colt indus operating corp  us   s ct   l ed d   since the wellpleaded claims in plaintiffs original petition filed in the district court of harris county could not have been the basis for original jurisdiction in the federal district court that court erred in permitting removal of the case from the state court and in assuming jurisdiction over the cause conclusion  accordingly the judgment of the federal district court in favor of defendants is vacated and the matter remanded to that court with instructions to return the case to the district court of harris county  vacated and remanded with instructions  circuit judge rich did not participate in the votes  luckett had also assigned the title of a second patent to another defendant and requested that the court order that defendant to formally reassign title back to luckett id luckett did not however make any assertions of infringement by this defendant see id  an assignment of the patent can only be effected by conveying either the entire patent an undivided part or share of the entire patent or all rights under the patent in a specified geographical region of the united states waterman v mackenzie  us    s ct    l ed   ritehite corp v kelley co  fd    uspqd   fedcir james f earl  free public
