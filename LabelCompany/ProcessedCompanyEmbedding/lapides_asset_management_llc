passion for lapides researchintensive investment process we are committed to building a firm the same way we build our client portfolios  thoughtfully over time and from the bottom up we are value investors specializing in investing in the securities of smaller companies by smaller we mean companies whose market capitalizations are defined as mid small and micro our investable range is approximately  million to  billion in market capitalization at the time of initial purchase which we then segment by product securities in the various funds may exceed or fall below these ranges as a result of appreciation or depreciation and will not necessarily be sold when outside the stated average market cap range  at times there may be add on purchases while the companies are outside the market cap range but no initial purchase will be made in a company that is outside the market cap range for separate accounts the specific market cap range is agreed upon by each client  a separate account has the ability to optin at current prices even if the companies exceed the market cap range we are a single strategy firm offering one investment process segmented into micro cap concentrated small cap and smallmid cap products offerings are managed in commingled limited partnerships or separate accounts depending upon account size and client preference our proven approach to value investing focuses on high quality businesses that  for whatever reason  have disappointed shareholders fallen out of favor or become misunderstood we believe our edge comes from our proprietary indepth research our unwavering commitment to our clients is to know our companies better than anyone else our research is global in nature  taking us around the world to better understand all aspects of the businesses of our portfolio investments our ultimate goal is to capture unrecognized meaningful change in a company before that change is widely understood and appreciated  and certainly before it is priced into the companys shares we sell when the market gets more enthusiastic than we are about a companys stock often after a recovery in operating fundamentals and subsequent multiple expansion in this way equities we buy as value investments are often sold to growthoriented investors hopefully at much higher valuations click here for important disclosure information  west putnam

meaningful absolute return within an attractive overall risk profile for our clients if our investment philosophy is the strategic basis for making investments it follows that our investment process defines the tactics that lead toward a purchase as we move through this process we first discover a suitable candidate then understand its business and products in order to best value its worth only when the reward for the risk taken is significantly attractive will we purchase shares once the investment is in our portfolio we continually monitor our original thesis and ultimately sell  hopefully at a significant gain importantly a strong appreciation for minimizing risk underlies everything we do our aim is to find for our clients portfolios the right companies at the right time at the right price please click below to read more on each step         prospect idea measure value build mosaic monitor thesis sell appropriately   manage risk             prospect idea we acquire our information directly and unfiltered then combine it with our knowledge of underlying industry dynamics the cumulative and generalist nature of our research teams experience is key to our ability to connect the many dots through comprehensive onsite visits and exhaustive indepth interviews with companies all over the world we develop a deeper understanding of potentially attractive investments for us a typical site visit to a company provides not only intelligence on a firm it also provides an opportunity to learn about a companys distributors vendors competitors and customers a skilled analyst is always prospecting  searching far and wide good ideas can come from anywhere in fact its almost easier to say where our ideas do not come from the brokerage community or from screening financial databases our objective is to find good companies that  for some temporary identifiable and correctable reason  have a discounted valuation in the marketplace under the right leadership performance and perception can materially improve buying our investments when they are out of favor allows us to bridge the gap between a companys current value and where it should be valued  the profitable transition over time from hidden gem into coveted jewel top measure value each of our investments must have a discount valuation and financial flexibility within the context of meaningful  however unrecognized  internal change our valuation process begins with traditional metrics such as the pricetoearnings ratio enterprise value to ebitda and free cash flow analysis importantly our valuations are based on longterm operating metrics and are measured against comparables we are nevertheless aware of the limits of assumptions in mathematical calculations so judgment and experience always trump a strictly formulaic approach financial flexibility is having the wherewithal to achieve the longterm strategic objectives that we believe are critical to reaching our investment premise during this phase of the investment process determining whether or not a company has financial flexibility and is trading at a sufficient discount is essential before proceeding top build mosaic our process has always been differentiated by its researchintensive nature the ancients built their mosaics by piecing together many small stones to create a picture our research methodology is likewise handson timeconsuming and enhanced by our investment teams decades of experience researching companies around the globe we build our mosaics out of small pebbles of information  some picked up right off the ground while many more are buried deep beneath the surface to be successful in an investment an investor must have an edge in information or an edge in perspective we buy a stock when we believe we have that edge again each lapides investment must have a discount valuation and financial flexibility within the context of meaningful  however unrecognized  internal change an understanding of that meaningful change is the picture our research mosaics yield top monitor thesis monitoring our thesis takes many different forms but we believe the real work begins once the first share is purchased when we intensify the process of substantiating our thesis and continually evaluating its validity this part of the process goes on for as long as we own a companys securities and even after as we may own a stock more than once our thesis must withstand rigorous scrutiny during the holding period we spend a great deal of time discussing issues and conditions with persons deeply involved in the company or industry line and staff executives other current and former employees customers competitors distributors vendors and anyone else in a position to evaluate the companys strategies and capabilities importantly we have the discipline to reappraise or readjust for significant events and changing environments top sell appropriately before determining whether it is appropriate to sell a companys stock we believe one must have a clear idea of why it was bought in the first place underscoring the importance of building the mosaic and monitoring our original thesis our sell discipline embodies balancing our expectations and the original thesis against the relative size of the position in the portfolio if the companys stock price fully reflects the impact of the meaningful internal change that was the original basis for our investment the position is sold we also sell when the markets become much more enthusiastic about our holding than we are  and that heightened enthusiasm is reflected in the valuation of course if we recognize that we have made a mistake in our initial analysis or if significant events alter the potential housed in our thesis we will also sell we approach our sell discipline with an acute sensitivity to other investors expectations knowing that their everchanging perspectives compel us to manage our positions proactively we are fully aware that selling appropriately involves balancing the concept of leaving money on the table against the knowledge that risk escalates with a rising valuation just as we accumulate our holdings in stages we typically average out when selling our cash position is a residual of the process top risk management we manage risk every step of the way  when prospecting for opportunities we must be able to understand the business  when valuing companies we are extremely sensitive to our assumptions trying to consider everything that can go wrong  by combining our deep understanding with our conviction in a company and by buying that companys equity at a meaningful discount to its potential value we seek to limit our downside considerably thus preserving capital and creating the opportunity for meaningful upside we also create the ability to further enhance our overall riskreward profile by averaging down purchasing more of a companys stock when the firms stock price falls  always conscious of the price impact of a sale at market we are patient sellers and we tend to average out over time top   click here for important disclosure information  west putnam ave th floor greenwich ct  t    f    �    lapides
