carli evp of worldwide sales vmware inc video transcript gary tubridy i’m with maurizio carli evp of worldwide sales from vmware maurizio welcome to the forum it’s great to have you here thanks for joining us maurizio carli thank you for the opportunity to be here gt maybe it is best to start with a quick description of the vmware business and your role in running worldwide sales mc vmware is one of the largest software companies nowadays and we are famous in the industry because introduce — we introduced a new software called virtualization and today everyone is utilizing this to give you an idea roughly one application out of two in whatever industry is running on our platform and we are giving basic to customer more costeffectiveness and agility in building an infrastructure where we detach the physical layer from the logical layer regarding my role i am responsible for the sales component of the company the company has around  employees and my responsibility is of the sales team is around  people gt so our event is all about a new role for sales and certainly in terms of representing that broad a portfolio to those kinds of functional users there certainly is a new role for sales at vmware can you tell me a little bit about the transformation that your sales organization has undergone mc originally as you can imagine selling a single product to optimize a single server was quite quoteunquote an easy activity meaning that was a matter to understand the footprint of a customer to put together a deal and then because was mainly a narrow eye kind of discussion to say the more you buy the more you can consolidate servers was a very simple sales motion today having a much more articulated portfolio not only would become more strategic but we had to move from selling a product to selling solution therefore we had to transform our sales force in being more capable to address clevel so cio cfo and business executives and moving from positioning a product into offering a solution to solve a business issue and to deliver it outcomes gt so that’s a big change are there some things that you did — and i call it having executive conversations – instead of talking about the product you are talking about something the product can do for an executive so you had to train and enable your sellers to have executive conversations are there some things that you’ve done to enable them to do that better mc so you are perfectly right so there were three actions that we had to take one the first and most important a mass server enablement plan to move from having our people knowledgeable about products into more capable to do what is called value selling so really to position our solution but not in terms of product functionality but in terms of what the customer could do to solve their business issue with our solution our products number one and this we did that — we do that year over year investing a lot in enablement we have internal resources but also using external companies number two not everyone in sales could make the transition so we had to significantly change the skill set of our sales population and third we are a company that is very much profitdriven and traditionally we had a simple patriarchal system typical distribution and reseller and oem today we sell transformational projects that require a lot of design a lot of services and requires the help of system integrator gt has your relationship with the marketing department changed as the complexity of what we deliver and the executives who we deliver it to requires some compelling messaging and marketing should be in the business of providing that perhaps have you changed your relationship with marketing to get that mc yes definitely in enlarging our portfolio and moving into solutions our marketing — our field marketing has to transform from positioning product to positioning solution but more important to moving from product functionality to use cases so if you like today when we go to a customer we try to position our solution in the way the customer has to understand how our solution can solve a business issue one example will be security instead to sell a product we say you have a security challenge because you want to secure our — your application across a different way you deploy and then you go down into a solution in the product that we start with high level messaging addressing the business pain of a customer gt i kind of appreciate it when a customer comes and says we’re going to make a change and i’m not sure how you fit in let’s talk about what might happen you’ve got an opportunity to take that problem and turn it into something much better mc exactly — this is what happened you know you have five seconds you say okay you don’t know where to stand but then because i truly believe that one beauty of vmware or my company is that we constantly innovate we constantly try to understand and to execute towards what is happening in the industry and despite we are not a cloud provider on a massive scale like the amazon or ibm or potentially google we decided to invest massively to become enabler to help our customer to move to the cloud in a smooth way to be sure that they can run connect and secure their application world into whatever infrastructure they want to run gt outstanding it sounds like you’re really busy but it sounds like it’s going to be very exciting mc now is my eighth year in this company i have to say that this is a fantastic company where every day we reinvent ourself and we look always forward to understand what customer needs and to satisfy the needs for today and for tomorrow gt outstanding maurizio thank you for joining us this year best of luck  mc thank you very much and a
