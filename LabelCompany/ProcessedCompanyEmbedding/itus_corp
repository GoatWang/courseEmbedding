previous next itus corp is latest patent monetizer to expand into product offerings itus corp itus the patent monetization company run by ceo robert berman said it has formed a new subsidiary anixa diagnostics corp for the purpose of developing and marketing noninvasive early cancer screening tests los angelesbased itus said anixa will be lead by dr amit kumar who will become executive chairman of anixa and also assume the role of vicechairman of itus itus is the second patent monetization company in recent weeks to launch a new unit focused on a commercial business joining finjan holdings inc fnjn which last week said it had formed a new unit to provide cybersecurity risk advisory service as well as launched a new mobile browser app that helps people detect cyber risks on the internet the move reflects berman’s effort to expand itus’ beyond its high risk monetization business and may boost its earnings power and also may help insulate the company from charges that its infringement litigation campaigns hurt rather than foster innovation patent monetizers who don’t sell products have been finding it harder and harder to turn a profit as defendants battle them in the courts moreover large jury verdicts have increasingly been thrown out or limited by appellate courts who also sometimes have invalidated the patents underlying the cases the  million award and royalty worth hundreds of millions of dollar vringo inc vrng won from google inc was later overturned and the patents invalidated by the court of appeals for the federal circuit similarly  million award virnetx holdings corp vhc won against apple inc was thrown out by the federal circuit and remanded back to the district court for a reassessment of damages the move also will allow itus to differentiate itself from patent monetizers who don’t sell products and who are often derisively referred to as patent trolls dr kumar has many years of experience in cancer diagnostics is a foremost expert in the utilization of cutting edge technolgies for early cancer screening and has successfully developed and guided several cancer diagnostic tests through the approval process and to the market with dr kumars expertise together with access to other leading scientists and renowned cancer institutes we currently have the resources that are necessary to bring noninvasive cancer diagnostic tests to market” dr kumar has previously worked as an executive founder and board member of several biotechnology companies he was president and ceo of combimatrix corp a developer of genomic diagnostic tests from september  to june  since leaving combimatrix dr kumar has been closely evaluating scientific data and carefully monitoring the advancement of scientific research in search of technologies that can be used to create highly impactful cancer screening tests and that are worthy of launching a new company itus said anixa has identified two technologies that it intends to use for its first cancer screening tests the first technology uses a biomarker that has been proven to be effective for the early detection of lung cancer the number one cause of cancer deaths for men and women the other technology focuses on biomarkers for the early detection of multiple solid tumors at both early and late stages of cancer shares of itus fell  or half a cent to  cents in overthecounter trading they’ve traded between  cents and  cents over the past year the company plans to hold a webbased conference call to present an update on itus and its new cancer diagnostic initiative anixa to listen
