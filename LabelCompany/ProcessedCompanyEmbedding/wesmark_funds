yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high low this fund scores low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns

funds investment strategies wesmark small company growth fund r the adviser selects stocks of companies which meet certain fundamental and technical standards of selection and have an aboveaverage potential for appreciation the fund will typically invest in companies in market sectors that offer the highest growth potential which historically have been telecommunication computer hardware and software technology healthcare and biotechnology however the fund may invest in other sectors if in the advisers opinion they offer a better opportunity for growth the adviser will select stocks of companies with growth characteristics such as aboveaverage earnings growth potential or where significant changes are taking place such as new products services or methods of distributions or overall business restructuring the funds investment philosophy will be to select rapidly growing companies with the expectation that this rapid growth will overcome any deficiencies in either balance sheet strength or high valuation opportunities that are identified in more mature industries may also be selected for investment by the fund r r the fund may purchase shares of exchangetraded funds etfs the shares of etfs are listed and traded on stock exchanges at market prices r r the fund may invest in etfs in order to achieve exposure to a specific market sector or for other reasons consistent with its investment strategy r r the adviser anticipates investing its cash balances in investments such as money market funds repurchase agreements commercial paper and shortterm us government agency and treasury securities r r the fund under normal circumstances will invest at least  of its net assets in investments in small companies in creating a diversified portfolio of common stocks of smallsized companies the adviser will define small companies as companies with market capitalizations similar to companies in the russell  or the sp  which are unmanaged broadbased capitalizationweighted indexes representing all major industries in the smallcap sector of the us stock market as of may   the russell s market capitalization range was  million to  billion and as of september   the sp s range was  million to  billion the capitalization ranges of the indexes frequently change as the market value of the stocks that comprise the indexes change or as stocks are added or removed from the indices r r if a company is within the capitalization range of an index at the time of investment but subsequently falls outside the index range the fund will not be required to sell such companys security r r because the fund refers to small company investments in its name it will notify shareholders at least  days in advance of any change in its investment policies that would permit the fund to normally invest less than  of its assets in investments in small companies r wesmark growth fund the fund strives to meet its investment goal by selecting growthoriented stocks of companies

fixed income securities and the percentage to invest in money market investments based on its view of economic and market conditions in making this determination the fund will stay within a percentage range for equity securities fixed income securities and money market instruments the following table shows the percentage ranges for the fund r equity      fixed income      money market        within the equity allocation the adviser anticipates investing primarily in the common stock of domestic companies with large and medium market capitalizations and may use a blend of styles in selecting

downgraded securities will be evaluated on a casebycase basis by the adviser the adviser will determine whether or not the security continues to be an acceptable investmentthe fund will invest in those sectors of the bond market that offer the highest yield in relation to historical yield spreads by recognizing changing relative yields and allocating the assets of the fund into the most attractive market and maturity sectors the fund will attempt to achieve above average returns the fund may invest in fixed income securities of any maturity ie short intermediate or long term r r the adviser anticipates investing its cash balances in investments such as money market funds repurchase agreements commercial paper and shortterm us government agency and treasury securities because the fund refers to fixed income securities in its name it will notify shareholders at least  days in advance of any change in its investment policies that would enable the fund to normally invest less than  of its assets in fixed income securities r wesmark west virginia municipal bond fund the fund attempts to achieve its investment objective by investing in a professionally managed portfolio consisting primarily of investment grade securities issued by the state of west virginia and its political subdivisions agencies and authorities and other issuers such as possessions or territories of the us the interest of which is exempt from federal and west virginia income tax west virginia municipal securities as a matter of fundamental investment policy which may not be changed without shareholder approval the fund will invest its assets so that under normal circumstances at least  of its net assets are invested in obligations the interest income from which is exempt from federal income tax and the income taxes imposed by the state of west virginia for purposes of this policy the taxfree interest must not be a preference item for purposes of computing the federal alternative minimum tax amt r the adviser may attempt to minimize market volatility by selecting intermediate term securities securities with an average maturity generally between five and seven years the fund will buy and sell securities to take advantage of opportunities to enhance yield these transactions may generate capital gains losses which have different tax treatment than taxexempt interest income the fund may invest a portion of its assets in nonwest virginia municipal bonds if in the judgement of the adviser the supply and yield of such securities would be beneficial to the funds performance r r temporary defensive investments r r the funds may temporarily depart from their principal investment strategies by investing their assets in cash cash items and shorterterm higherquality debt securities and similar obligations they may do this to minimize potential losses and maintain liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions during adverse market conditions this may cause a fund to give up greater investment returns to maintain the safety of principal that is the original amount invested by shareholders r what are the principal securities in which the funds invest in pursuing their

                   x r equity securities equity securities represent a share of an issuers earnings and assets after the issuer pays its liabilities a fund cannot predict the income it will receive from equity securities because issuers generally have discretion as to the payment of any dividends or distributions however equity securities offer greater potential for appreciation than many other types of securities because their value increases directly with the value of the issuers business the following describes the types of equity securities in which a fund may invest common stocks common stocks are the most prevalent type of equity security common stocks receive the issuers earnings after the issuer pays its creditors and any preferred stockholders as a result changes in an issuers earnings directly influence the value of its common stock preferred stocks preferred stocks have the right to receive specified dividends or distributions before the issuer makes payments on its common stock some preferred stocks also participate in dividends and distributions paid on common stock preferred stocks may also permit the issuer to redeem the stock a fund may also treat such redeemable preferred stock as a fixed income security fixed income securities fixed income securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time fixed income securities provide more regular income than equity securities however the returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with the issuers earnings this limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as compared to equity securities a securitys yield measures the annual income earned on a security as a percentage of its price a securitys yield will increase or decrease depending upon whether it costs less a discount or more a premium than the principal amount if the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity the price and yield on a discount or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early redemption securities with higher risks generally have higher yields the following describes the types of fixed income securities in which the funds may invest treasury securities treasury securities are direct obligations of the federal government of the united states treasury securities are generally regarded as having the lowest credit risks agency securities agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a federal agency or other government sponsored entity gse acting under federal authority some gse securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states these include the government national mortgage association small business administration farm credit system financial assistance corporation farmers home administration federal financing bank general services administration department of housing and urban development exportimport bank overseas private investment corporation and washington metropolitan area transit authority bonds other gse securities receive support through federal subsidies loans or other benefits for example the us treasury is authorized to purchase specified amounts of securities issued by or otherwise make funds available to the federal home loan bank system federal home loan mortgage corporation federal national mortgage association student loan marketing association and tennessee valley authority in support of such obligations a few gse securities have no explicit financial support but are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities these include the farm credit system the financing corporation and resolution funding corporation investors regard agency securities as having low credit risks but not as low as treasury securities a fund creates mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by a gse as if issued or guaranteed by a federal agency although such a guarantee protects against credit risks it does not reduce market and prepayment risks corporate debt securities corporate debt securities are fixed income securities issued by businesses notes bonds debentures and commercial paper are the most prevalent types of corporate debt securities a fund may also purchase interests in bank loans to companies the credit risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers in addition the credit risk of an issuers debt security may vary based on its priority for repayment for example higher ranking senior debt securities have a higher priority than lower ranking subordinated securities this means that the issuer might not make payments on subordinated securities while continuing to make payments on senior securities in addition in the event of bankruptcy holders of senior securities may receive amounts otherwise payable to the holders of subordinated securities some subordinated securities such as trust preferred and capital securities notes also permit the issuer to defer payments under certain circumstances for example insurance companies issue securities known as surplus notes that permit the insurance company to defer any payment that would reduce its capital below regulatory requirements mortgagebacked securities mortgagebacked securities represent interests in pools of mortgages the mortgages that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates maturities and other terms mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest rates interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as arms mortgagebacked securities come in a variety of forms many have extremely complicated terms the simplest form of mortgagebacked securities are passthrough certificates an issuer of passthrough certificates gathers monthly payments from an underlying pool of mortgages then the issuer deducts its fees and expenses and passes the balance of the payments on to the certificate holders once a month holders of passthrough certificates receive a pro rata share of all payments and prepayments from the underlying mortgages as a result the holders assume all the prepayment risks of the underlying mortgages collateralized mortgage obligations cmos cmos including interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics allocate payments and prepayments from an underlying passthrough certificate among holders of different classes of mortgagebacked securities this creates different prepayment and market risks for each cmo class ios and pos cmos may allocate interest payments to one class interest only or ios and principal payments to another class principal only or pos pos increase in value when prepayment rates increase in contrast ios decrease in value when prepayments increase because the underlying mortgages generate less interest payments however ios tend to increase in value when interest rates rise and prepayments decrease making ios a useful hedge against interest rate risks asset backed securities asset backed securities are payable from pools of obligations other than mortgages most asset backed securities involve consumer or commercial debts with maturities of less than ten years however almost any type of fixed income assets including other fixed income securities may be used to create an asset backed security asset backed securities may take the form of commercial paper notes or pass through certificates asset backed securities have prepayment risks like cmos asset backed securities may be structured like floating rate securities ios and pos credit enhancement credit enhancement consists of an arrangement in which a company agrees to pay amounts due on a fixed income security if the issuer defaults in some cases the company providing credit enhancement makes all payments directly to the security holders and receives reimbursement from the issuer normally the credit enhancer has greater financial resources and liquidity than the issuer for this reason the subadviser usually evaluates the credit risk of a fixed income security based solely upon its credit enhancement tax exempt securities tax exempt securities are fixed income securities that pay interest that is not subject to regular federal andor state income taxes typically states counties cities and other political subdivisions and authorities issue tax exempt securities the market categorizes tax exempt securities by their source of repayment general obligation bonds general obligation bonds are supported by the issuers power to impose property or other taxes the issuer must impose and collect taxes sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds however the issuers authority to impose additional taxes may be limited by its charter or state law special revenue bonds special revenue bonds are payable solely from specific revenues received by the issuer such as specific taxes assessments tolls or fees special revenue bondholders may not collect from the municipalitys general taxes or revenues for example a municipality may issue bonds to build a toll road and pledge the tolls to repay the bonds therefore a shortfall in the tolls could result in a default on the bonds r special transactions r r repurchase agreements r r repurchase agreements are transactions in which a fund buys a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreed upon time and price the repurchase price exceeds the sale price reflecting a funds return on the transaction this return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security a fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as securities dealers deemed creditworthy by the adviser r r the funds custodian or subcustodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements the adviser or subcustodian will monitor the value of the underlying security each day to ensure that the value of the security always equals or exceeds the repurchase price r investing in securities of other investment companies r the funds may invest its assets in securities of other investment companies including the securities of money market funds affiliated with federated investors inc federated as an efficient means of carrying out its investment policies and managing its uninvested cash these other investment companies are managed independently of the funds and incur additional expenses therefore any such investment by a fund may be subject to duplicate expenses however the adviser believes that the benefits and efficiencies of this approach should outweigh the additional expenses r r the small company growth fund the growth fund and the balanced fund may also invest in etfs as with traditional mutual funds etfs charge assetbased fees although these fees tend to be relatively low etfs do not charge initial sales charges or redemption fees and investors pay only customary brokerage fees to buy and sell etf shares r investment ratings for investment grade securities the adviser will determine whether a security is investment grade based upon the credit ratings given by one or more nrsro for example standard and poors a rating service assigns ratings to investment grade securities aaa aa a and bbb based on their assessment of the issuers ability to pay interest or principal default when due on each security lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk if a security has not received a rating a fund must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment that the security is comparable to investment grade what are the specific risks of investing in the funds r risks      small company growth fund      growth fund      balanced fund      bond fund

will reflect changes in prices of individual portfolio stocks or general changes in stock valuations consequently a funds share price may decline the adviser attempts to manage market risk by limiting the amount a fund invests in each companys equity securities however diversification will not protect a fund against widespread or prolonged declines in the stock market r credit risks r credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing to pay interest or principal when due if an issuer defaults a fund will lose money many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services such as standard  poors and moodys investor services these services assign ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of issuer default lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk if a security has not received a rating a fund must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying interest at a higher rate the difference between the yield of a security and the yield of a us treasury security with a comparable maturity the spread measures the additional interest paid for risk spreads may increase generally in response to adverse economic or market conditions a securitys spread may also increase if the securitys rating is lowered or the security is perceived to have an increased credit risk an increase in the spread will cause the price of the security to decline credit risk includes the possibility that a party to a transaction such as a repurchase agreement involving a fund will fail to meet its obligations this could cause a fund to lose the benefit of the transaction or prevent a fund from selling or buying other securities to implement its investment strategy r interest rate risks r r prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest rate changes for similar securities generally when interest rates rise prices of fixed income securities fall however market factors such as the demand for particular fixed income securities may cause the price of certain fixed income securities to fall while the prices of other securities rise or remain unchanged r r interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed income securities with longer durations duration measures the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates r r risks related to investing for value r r due to their relatively low valuations value stocks are typically less volatile than growth stocks for instance the price of a value stock may experience a smaller increase on a forecast of higher earnings a positive fundamental development or positive market development further value stocks tend to have higher dividends than growth stocks this means they depend less on price changes for returns and may lag behind growth stocks in an up market r r risks related to investing for growth r r due to their relatively high valuations growth stocks are typically more volatile than value stocks for instance the price of a growth stock may experience a larger decline on a forecast of lower earnings a negative fundamental development or an adverse market development further growth stocks may not pay dividends or may pay lower dividends than value stocks this means they depend more on price changes for returns and may be more adversely affected in a down market compared to value stocks that pay higher dividends r r risks related to company size r r generally the smaller the market capitalization of a company the fewer the number of shares traded daily the less liquid its stock and the more volatile its price market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current market price per share r r companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have unproven track records a limited product or service base and limited access to capital these factors also increase risks and make these companies more likely to fail than larger well capitalized companies r r risks associated with complex cmos r r cmos with complex or highly variable prepayment terms such as companion classes ios pos inverse floaters and residuals generally entail greater market prepayment and liquidity risks than other mortgagebacked securities for example their prices are more volatile and their trading market may be more limited r call and prepayment risks call risk is the possibility that an issuer may redeem a fixed income security before maturity a call at a price below its current market price an increase in the likelihood of a call may reduce the securitys price if a fixed income security is called a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates higher credit risks or other less favorable characteristics generally homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages at any time without penalty homeowners frequently refinance high interest rate mortgages when mortgage rates fall this results in the prepayment of mortgagebacked securities with higher interest rates conversely prepayments due to refinancings decrease when mortgage rates increase this extends the life of mortgagebacked securities with lower interest rates as a result increases in prepayments of high interest rate mortgagebacked securities or decreases in prepayments of lower interest rate mortgagebacked securities may reduce their yield and price this relationship between interest rates and mortgage prepayments makes the price of mortgagebacked securities more volatile than most other types of fixed income securities with comparable credit risks sector risks companies with similar characteristics may be grouped together in broad categories called sectors sector risk is the possibility that a certain sector may underperform other sectors or the market as a whole as the adviser allocates more of a funds portfolio holdings to a particular sector a funds performance will be more susceptible to any economic business or other developments which generally affect that sector r tax risks r r in order to be taxexempt municipal securities must meet certain legal requirements failure to meet such requirements may cause the interest received and distributed by a fund to shareholders to be taxable r changes or proposed changes in federal tax laws may cause the prices of municipal securities to fall income from a fund may be subject to the amt diversification risks r compared to diversified mutual funds a nondiversified fund may invest a higher percentage of its assets among fewer issuers of portfolio securities this increases the west virginia municipal bond funds risk by magnifying the impact positively or negatively that any one issuer has on the west virginia municipal bond funds share price and performance r r exchangetraded funds risks r r an investment in an etf generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a conventional fund ie one that is not exchange traded that has the same investment objectives strategies and policies the price of an etf can fluctuate up or down and a fund could lose money investing in an etf if the prices of the securities owned by the etf go down in addition etfs may be subject to the following risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds i the market price of an etfs shares may trade above or below their net asset value ii an active trading market for an etfs shares may not develop or be maintained or iii trading of an etfs shares may be halted if the listing exchanges officials deem such action appropriate the shares are delisted from the exchange or the activation of marketwide circuit breakers which are tied to large decreases in stock prices halts stock trading generally r west virginia sector risks because the west virginia municipal bond fund invests primarily in issuers from a single state the fund may be subject to additional risks compared to funds that invest in multiple states west virginias economy is heavily dependent upon certain industries such as coal mining manufacturing and tourism any downturn in these and other industries may adversely affect the economy of the state what do shares cost r you can purchase redeem or

less than  days at the time of purchase may be valued at amortized cost for mortgagebacked securities prices furnished by the independent pricing service are based on the aggregate investment value of the projected cash flows to be generated by the security for other fixed income securities prices furnished by an independent pricing service are intended to be indicative of the mean between the bid and asked prices currently offered to institutional investors for the securities r r where a last sale price or market quotation for a portfolio security is not readily available and no independent pricing service furnishes a price the value of the security used in computing nav is its fair value as determined in good faith under procedures approved by the funds board of trustees the board the funds may use the fair value of a security to calculate its nav when for example  a portfolio security is not traded in a public market or the principal market in which the security trades is closed  trading in a portfolio security is suspended and not resumed prior to the normal market close  a portfolio security is not traded in significant volume for a substantial period or  the funds adviser determines that the quotation or price for a portfolio security provided by a dealer or independent pricing service is inaccurate r r fair valuation procedures are also used where a significant event affecting the value of a portfolio security is determined to have occurred between the time as of which the price of the portfolio security is determined and the nyse closing time as of which a funds nav is computed an event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the securitys value will change in response to the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value significant events include significant general securities market movements occurring between the time as of which the price of the portfolio security is determined and the close of trading on the nyse for domestic fixed income securities such events may occur where the cutoff time for the market information used by the independent pricing service is earlier than the end of regular trading on the nyse in such cases use of fair valuation can reduce an investors ability to seek to profit by estimating a funds nav in advance of the time as of which nav is calculated r r in some cases events affecting the issuer of a portfolio security may be considered significant events announcements concerning earnings acquisitions new products management changes litigation developments a strike or natural disaster affecting the companys operations or regulatory changes or market developments affecting the issuers industry occurring between the time as of which the price of the portfolio security is determined and the close of trading on the nyse are examples of potentially significant events there can be no assurance that the fund could purchase or sell a portfolio security at the price used to calculate the funds nav in the case of fair valued portfolio securities lack of information and uncertainty as to the significance of information may lead to a conclusion that a prior valuation is the best indication of a portfolio securitys present value fair valuations generally remain unchanged until new information becomes available

their investment strategies the funds may in addition to the securities listed in the funds prospectus invest in the following securities for any purpose that is consistent with their investment objectives equity securities equity securities represent a share of an issuers earnings and assets after the issuer pays its liabilities a fund cannot predict the income it will receive from equity securities because issuers generally have discretion as to the payment of any dividends or distributions however equity securities offer greater potential for appreciation than many other types of securities because their value increases directly with the value of the issuers business the following describes the types of equity securities in which the funds may invest common stocks common stocks are the most common type of equity security while holders of common stocks may receive a portion of the issuers earnings in the form of dividends dividends are generally only paid after the issuer pays its creditors and any preferred stockholders in addition issuers generally have discretion as to the payment of any dividends therefore a fund cannot predict the income it will receive if any from common stocks however common stocks offer greater potential for appreciation than many other types of securities because their value generally increases with the value of the issuers business as a result changes in an issuers earnings may directly influence the value of its common stock preferred stocks preferred stocks have the right to receive specified dividends or distributions before the issuer makes payments on its common stock some preferred stocks also participate in dividends and distributions paid on common stock preferred stocks may also permit the issuer to redeem the stock the funds may also treat such redeemable preferred stock as a fixed income security because preferred stock dividends usually must be paid before common stock dividends preferred stocks generally entail less risk than common stocks however preferred stocks do not represent a liability of the issuer and therefore do not offer as great a degree of protection of capital or assurance of continued income as investments in corporate debt securities real estate investment trusts reits reits are real estate investment trusts that lease operate and finance commercial real estate reits are exempt from federal corporate income tax if they limit their operations and distribute most of their income such tax requirements limit a reits ability to respond to changes in the commercial real estate market warrants warrants give a fund the option to buy the issuers equity securities at a specified price the exercise price at a specified future date the expiration date a fund may buy the designated securities by paying the exercise price before the expiration date warrants may become worthless if the price of the stock does not rise above the exercise price by the expiration date this increases the market risks of warrants as compared to the underlying security rights are the same as warrants except companies typically issue rights to existing stockholders fixed income securities fixed income securities pay interest dividends or distributions at a specified rate the rate may be a fixed percentage of the principal or adjusted periodically in addition the issuer of a fixed income security must repay the principal amount of the security normally within a specified time fixed income securities provide more regular income than equity securities however the returns on fixed income securities are limited and normally do not increase with the issuers earnings this limits the potential appreciation of fixed income securities as compared to equity securities a securitys yield measures the annual income earned on a security as a percentage of its price a securitys yield will increase or decrease depending upon whether it costs less a discount or more a premium than the principal amount if the issuer may redeem the security before its scheduled maturity the price and yield on a discount or premium security may change based upon the probability of an early redemption securities with higher risks generally have higher yields the following describes the types of fixed income securities in which a fund may invest treasury securities treasury securities are direct obligations of the federal government of the united states treasury securities are generally regarded as having the lowest credit risks agency securities agency securities agency securities are issued or guaranteed by a federal agency or other government sponsored entity gse acting under federal authority some gse securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states these include the government national mortgage association small business administration farm credit system financial assistance corporation farmers home administration federal financing bank general services administration department of housing and urban development exportimport bank overseas private investment corporation and washington metropolitan area transit authority bonds other gse securities receive support through federal subsidies loans or other benefits for example the us treasury is authorized to purchase specified amounts of securities issued by or otherwise make funds available to the federal home loan bank system federal home loan mortgage corporation federal national mortgage association student loan marketing association and tennessee valley authority in support of such obligations a few gse securities have no explicit financial support but are regarded as having implied support because the federal government sponsors their activities these include the farm credit system financing corporation and resolution funding corporation investors regard agency securities as having low credit risks but not as low as treasury securities a fund treats mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by a gse as if issued or guaranteed by a federal agency although such a guarantee protects against credit risks it does not reduce market and prepayment risks corporate debt securities corporate debt securities are fixed income securities issued by businesses notes bonds debentures and commercial paper are the most prevalent types of corporate debt securities a fund may also purchase interests in bank loans to companies the credit risks of corporate debt securities vary widely among issuers in addition the credit risk of an issuers debt security may vary based on its priority for repayment for example higher ranking senior debt securities have a higher priority than lower ranking subordinated securities this means that the issuer might not make payments on subordinated securities while continuing to make payments on senior securities in addition in the event of bankruptcy holders of senior securities may receive amounts otherwise payable to the holders of subordinated securities some subordinated securities such as trust preferred and capital securities notes also permit the issuer to defer payments under certain circumstances for example insurance companies issue securities known as surplus notes that permit the insurance company to defer any payment that would reduce its capital below regulatory requirements commercial paper commercial paper is an issuers obligation with a maturity of less than nine months companies typically issue commercial paper to pay for current expenditures most issuers constantly reissue their commercial paper and use the proceeds or bank loans to repay maturing paper if the issuer cannot continue to obtain liquidity in this fashion its commercial paper may default the short maturity of commercial paper reduces both the market and credit risks as compared to other debt securities of the same issuer bank instruments bank instruments are unsecured interest bearing deposits with banks bank instruments include bank accounts time deposits certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances yankee instruments are denominated in us dollars and issued by us branches of foreign banks eurodollar instruments are denominated in us dollars and issued by nonus branches of us or foreign banks mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities represent interests in pools of mortgages the mortgages that comprise a pool normally have similar interest rates maturities and other terms mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest rates interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as arms mortgage backed securities come in a variety of forms many have extremely complicated terms the simplest form of mortgage backed securities are passthrough certificates an issuer of passthrough certificates gathers monthly payments from an underlying pool of mortgages then the issuer deducts its fees and expenses and passes the balance of the payments on to the certificate holders once a month holders of passthrough certificates receive a pro rata share of all payments and prepayments from the underlying mortgages as a result the holders assume all the prepayment risks of the underlying mortgages collateralized mortgage obligations cmos cmos including interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics allocate payments and prepayments from an underlying passthrough certificate among holders of different classes of mortgage backed securities this creates different prepayment and market risks for each cmo class sequential cmos in a sequential pay cmo one class of cmos receives all principal payments and prepayments the next class of cmos receives all principal payments after the first class is paid off this process repeats for each sequential class of cmo as a result each class of sequential pay cmos reduces the prepayment risks of subsequent classes pacs tacs and companion classes more sophisticated cmos include planned amortization classes pacs and targeted amortization classes tacs pacs and tacs are issued with companion classes pacs and tacs receive principal payments and prepayments at a specified rate the companion classes receive principal payments and prepayments in excess of the specified rate in addition pacs will receive the companion classes share of principal payments if necessary to cover a shortfall in the prepayment rate this helps pacs and tacs to control prepayment risks by increasing the risks to their companion classes ios and pos cmos may allocate interest payments to one class interest only or ios and principal payments to another class principal only or pos pos increase in value when prepayment rates increase in contrast ios decrease in value when prepayments increase because the underlying mortgages generate less interest payments however ios tend to increase in value when interest rates rise and prepayments decrease making ios a useful hedge against interest rate risks floaters and inverse floaters another variant allocates interest payments between two classes of cmos one class floaters receives a share of interest payments based upon a market index such as the london interbank offered rate libor the other class inverse floaters receives any remaining interest payments from the underlying mortgages floater classes receive more interest and inverse floater classes receive correspondingly less interest as interest rates rise this shifts prepayment and interest rate risks from the floater to the inverse floater class reducing the price volatility of the floater class and increasing the price volatility of the inverse floater class z classes and residual classes cmos must allocate all payments received from the underlying mortgages to some class to capture any unallocated payments cmos generally have an accrual z class z classes do not receive any payments from the underlying mortgages until all other cmo classes have been paid off once this happens holders of z class cmos receive all payments and prepayments similarly remics have residual interests that receive any mortgage payments not allocated to another remic class the degree of increased or decreased prepayment risks depends upon the structure of the cmos however the actual returns on any type of mortgage backed security depend upon the performance of the underlying pool of mortgages which no one can predict and will vary among pools asset backed securities asset backed securities are payable from pools of obligations other than mortgages most asset backed securities involve consumer or commercial debts with maturities of less than ten years however almost any type of fixed income assets including other fixed income securities may be used to create an asset backed security asset backed securities may take the form of commercial paper notes or pass through certificates asset backed securities have prepayment risks like cmos asset backed securities may be structured like floating rate securities ios and pos zero coupon securities zero coupon securities do not pay interest or principal until final maturity unlike debt securities that provide periodic payments of interest referred to as a coupon payment investors buy zero coupon securities at a price below the amount payable at maturity the difference between the purchase price and the amount received at maturity represents interest on the zero coupon security investors must wait until maturity to receive interest and principal which increases the interest rate and credit risks of a zero coupon security credit enhancement credit enhancement consists of an arrangement in which a company agrees to pay amounts due on a fixed income security if the issuer defaults in some cases the company providing credit enhancement makes all payments directly to the security holders and receives reimbursement from the issuer normally the credit enhancer has greater financial resources and liquidity than the issuer for this reason the adviser usually evaluates the credit risk of a fixed income security based solely upon its credit enhancement common types of credit enhancement include guarantees letters of credit bond insurance and surety bonds credit enhancement also includes arrangements where securities or other liquid assets secure payment of a fixed income security if a default occurs these assets may be sold and the proceeds paid to security holders either form of credit enhancement reduces credit risks by providing another source of payment for a fixed income security convertible securities convertible securities are fixed income securities that a fund has the option to exchange for equity securities at a specified conversion price the option allows a fund to realize additional returns if the market price of the equity securities exceeds the conversion price for example a fund may hold fixed income securities that are convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of  per share if the market value of the shares of common stock reached  a fund could realize an additional  per share by converting its fixed income securities convertible securities have lower yields than comparable fixed income securities in addition at the time a convertible security is issued the conversion price exceeds the market value of the underlying equity securities thus convertible securities may provide lower returns than nonconvertible fixed income securities or equity securities depending upon changes in the price of the underlying equity securities however convertible securities permit a fund to realize some of the potential appreciation of the underlying equity securities with less risk of losing its initial investment a fund treats convertible securities as both fixed income and equity securities for purposes of their investment policies and limitations because of their unique characteristics tax exempt securities tax exempt securities are fixed income securities that pay interest that is not subject to regular federal andor state income taxes typically states counties cities and other political subdivisions and authorities issue tax exempt securities the market categorizes tax exempt securities by their source of repayment general obligation bonds general obligation bonds are supported by the issuers power to impose property or other taxes the issuer must impose and collect taxes sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds however the issuers authority to impose additional taxes may be limited by its charter or state law special revenue bonds special revenue bonds are payable solely from specific revenues received by the issuer such as specific taxes assessments tolls or fees special revenue bondholders may not collect from the municipalitys general taxes or revenues for example a municipality may issue bonds to build a toll road and pledge the tolls to repay the bonds therefore a shortfall in the tolls could result in a default on the bonds private activity bonds private activity bonds are special revenue bonds used to finance private entities for example a municipality may issue bonds to finance a new factory to improve its local economy the municipality would lend the proceeds from its bonds to the company using the factory and the company would agree to make loan payments sufficient to repay the bonds the bonds would be payable solely from the companys loan payments not from any other revenues of the municipality therefore any default on the loan normally would result in a default on the bonds the interest on many types of private activity bonds is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax amt a fund may invest in bonds subject to amt tax increment financing bonds tax increment financing tif bonds are payable from increases in taxes or other revenues attributable to projects financed by the bonds for example a municipality may issue tif bonds to redevelop a commercial area the tif bonds would be payable solely from any increase in sales taxes collected from merchants in the area the bonds could default if merchants sales and related tax collections failed to increase as anticipated municipal notes municipal notes are shortterm tax exempt securities many municipalities issue such notes to fund their current operations before collecting taxes or other municipal revenues municipalities may also issue notes to fund capital projects prior to issuing longterm bonds the issuers typically repay the notes at the end of their fiscal year either with taxes other revenues or proceeds from newly issued notes or bonds variable rate demand instruments variable rate demand instruments are tax exempt securities that require the issuer or a third party such as a dealer or bank to repurchase the security for its face value upon demand the securities also pay interest at a variable rate intended to cause the securities to trade at their face value the fund treats demand instruments as shortterm securities because their variable interest rate adjusts in response to changes in market rates even though their stated maturity may extend beyond thirteen months municipal leases municipalities may enter into leases for equipment or facilities in order to comply with state public financing laws these leases are typically subject to annual appropriation in other words a municipality may end a lease without penalty by not providing for the lease payments in its annual budget after the lease ends the lessor can resell the equipment or facility but may lose money on the sale the fund may invest in securities supported by pools of municipal leases the most common type of lease backed securities is certificates of participation cops however the fund may also invest directly in individual leases foreign securities foreign securities are securities of issuers based outside the united states the funds consider an issuer to be based outside the united states if o it is organized under the laws of or has a principal office located in another country o the principal trading market for its securities is in another country or o it or its subsidiaries derived in its most current fiscal year at least  of its total assets capitalization gross revenue or profit from goods produced services performed or sales made in another country foreign securities are primarily denominated in foreign currencies along with the risks normally associated with domestic securities of the same type foreign securities are subject to currency risks and risks of foreign investing trading in certain foreign markets is also subject to liquidity risks depositary receipts depositary receipts represent interests in underlying shares issued by a foreign company depositary receipts are not traded in the same market as the underlying security american depositary receipts adrs are also traded in us dollars eliminating the need for foreign exchange transactions the foreign securities underlying european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs and international depositary receipts idrs are traded globally or outside the united states depositary receipts involve many of the same risks of investing directly in foreign securities including currency risks and risks of foreign investing foreign exchange contracts in order to convert us dollars into the currency needed to buy a foreign security or to convert foreign currency received from the sale of a foreign security into us dollars the international equity fund may enter into spot currency trades in a spot trade the fund agrees to exchange one currency for another at the current exchange rate the fund may also enter into derivative contracts in which a foreign currency is an underlying asset the exchange rate for currency derivative contracts may be higher or lower than the spot exchange rate use of these derivative contracts may increase or decrease the funds exposure to currency risks derivative contracts derivative contracts are financial instruments that require payments based upon changes in the values of designated or underlying securities currencies commodities financial indices or other assets some derivative contracts such as futures forwards and options require payments relating to a future trade involving the underlying asset other derivative contracts such as swaps require payments relating to the income or returns from the underlying asset the other party to a derivative contract is referred to as a counterparty many derivative contracts are traded on securities or commodities exchanges in this case the exchange sets all the terms of the contract except for the price investors make payments due under their contracts through the exchange most exchanges require investors to maintain margin accounts through their brokers to cover their potential obligations to the exchange parties to the contract make or collect daily payments to the margin accounts to reflect losses or gains in the value of their contracts this protects investors against potential defaults by the counterparty trading contracts on an exchange also allows investors to close out their contracts by entering into offsetting contracts for example a fund could close out an open contract to buy an asset at a future date by entering into an offsetting contract to sell the same asset on the same date if the offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price a fund realizes a gain if it is less a fund realizes a loss exchanges may limit the amount of open contracts permitted at any one time such limits may prevent a fund from closing out a position if this happens a fund will be required to keep the contract open even if it is losing money on the contract and to make any payments required under the contract even if it has to sell portfolio securities at unfavorable prices to do so inability to close out a contract could also harm a fund by preventing it from disposing of or trading any assets it has been using to secure its obligations under the contract a fund may also trade derivative contracts overthecounter otc in transactions negotiated directly between a fund and the counterparty otc contracts do not necessarily have standard terms so they cannot be directly offset with other otc contracts in addition otc contracts with more specialized terms may be more difficult to price than exchange traded contracts depending upon how a fund uses derivative contracts and the relationships between the market value of a derivative contract and the underlying asset derivative contracts may increase or decrease a funds exposure to interest rate stock market currency and credit risks and may also expose a fund to liquidity and leverage risks otc contracts also expose a fund to credit risks in the event that a counterparty defaults on the contract a fund may trade in the following types of derivative contracts including combinations thereof futures contracts futures contracts provide for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of an underlying asset at a specified price date and time entering into a contract to buy an underlying asset is commonly referred to as buying a contract or holding a long position in the asset entering into a contract to sell an underlying asset is commonly referred to as selling a contract or holding a short position in the asset futures contracts are considered to be commodity contracts futures contracts traded otc are frequently referred to as forward contracts options options are rights to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument for a specified price the exercise price during or at the end of a specified period the seller or writer of the option receives a payment or premium from the buyer which the writer keeps regardless of whether the buyer uses or exercises the option options can trade on exchanges or in the otc market and may be bought or sold on a wide variety of underlying assets or instruments including financial indices individual securities and other derivative instruments such as futures contracts options that are written on futures contracts will be subject to margin requirements similar to those applied to futures contracts a fund may o buy put options on portfolio securities securities indices and listed put options on futures contracts in anticipation of a decrease in the value of the underlying asset o write covered call options on portfolio securities and listed call options on futures contracts to generate income from premiums and in anticipation of a decrease or only limited increase in the value of the underlying asset if a call written by a fund is exercised the fund foregoes any possible profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying asset over the exercise price plus the premium received o write secured put options on portfolio securities to generate income from premiums and in anticipation of an increase or only limited decrease in the value of the underlying asset in writing puts there is a risk that a fund may be required to take delivery of the underlying asset when its current market price is lower than the exercise price o when a fund writes options on futures contracts it will be subject to margin requirements similar to those applied to futures contracts and o buy or write options to close out existing options positions a fund may also write call options on financial futures contracts to generate income from premiums and in anticipation of a decrease or only limited increase in the value of the underlying asset if a call written by a fund is exercised the fund foregoes any possible profit from an increase in the market price of the underlying asset over the exercise price plus the premium received a fund may also write put options on financial futures contracts to generate income from premiums and in anticipation of an increase or only limited decrease in the value of the underlying asset in writing puts there is a risk that a fund may be required to take delivery of the underlying asset when its current market price is lower than the exercise price when a fund writes options on futures contracts it will be subject to margin requirements similar to those applied to futures contracts municipal bond insurance the west virginia municipal bond fund may purchase municipal securities covered by insurance which guarantees the timely payment of principal at maturity and interest on such securities policy or policies these insured municipal securities are either  covered by an insurance policy applicable to a particular security whether obtained by the issuer of the security or by a third party issuerobtained insurance or  insured under master insurance policies issued by municipal bond insurers which may be purchased by the fund the premiums for the policies may be paid by the fund and the yield on the funds portfolio may be reduced thereby the fund may require or obtain municipal bond insurance when purchasing municipal securities which would not otherwise meet the funds quality standards the fund may also require or obtain municipal bond insurance when purchasing or holding specific municipal securities when in the opinion of the funds adviser such insurance would benefit the fund for example through improvement of portfolio quality or increased liquidity of certain securities the funds adviser anticipates that between  and  of the funds net assets will be invested in municipal securities which are insured issuerobtained insurance policies are noncancelable and continue in force as long as the municipal securities are outstanding and their respective insurers remain in business if a municipal security is covered by issuerobtained insurance then such security need not be insured by the policies purchased by a fund the fund may purchase two types of policies issued by municipal bond insurers one type of policy covers certain municipal securities only during the period in which they are in the funds portfolio in the event that a municipal security covered by such a policy is sold from a fund the insurer of the relevant policy will be liable for those payments of interest and principal which are due and owing at the time of the sale the other type of policy covers municipal securities not only while they remain in the funds portfolio but also until their final maturity if they are sold out of the funds portfolio so that the coverage may benefit all subsequent holders of those municipal securities the fund will obtain insurance which covers municipal securities until final maturity even after they are sold out of the funds portfolio only if in the judgment of the adviser the fund would receive net proceeds from the sale of those securities after deducting the cost of such permanent insurance and related fees significantly in excess of the proceeds it would receive if such municipal securities were sold without insurance payments received from municipal bond issuers may not be taxexempt income to shareholders of the fund the fund may purchase municipal securities insured by policies from mbia corp mbia ambac indemnity corporation ambac financial guaranty insurance company fgic or any other municipal bond insurer which is rated aaa by sp or aaa by moodys each policy guarantees the payment of principal and interest on those municipal securities it insures the policies will have the same general characteristics and features a municipal security will be eligible for coverage if it meets certain requirements set forth in the policy in the event interest or principal on an insured municipal security is not paid when due the insurer covering the security will be obligated under its policy to make such payment not later than  days after it has been notified by the fund that such nonpayment has occurred mbia ambac and fgic will not have the right to withdraw coverage on securities insured by their policies so long as such securities remain in the funds portfolio nor may mbia ambac or fgic cancel their policies for any reason except failure to pay premiums when due mbia ambac and fgic will reserve the right at any time upon  days written notice to the fund to refuse to insure any additional municipal securities purchased by the fund after the effective date of such notice the fund reserves the right to terminate any of the policies if they determine that the benefits to a fund of having its portfolio insured under such policy are not justified by the expense involved additionally the fund reserves the right to enter into contracts with insurance carriers other than mbia ambac or fgic if such carriers are rated aaa by sp or aaa by moodys special transactions repurchase agreements repurchase agreements are transactions in which a fund buys a security from a dealer or bank and agrees to sell the security back at a mutually agreed upon time and price the repurchase price exceeds the sale price reflecting a funds return on the transaction this return is unrelated to the interest rate on the underlying security a fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with banks and other recognized financial institutions such as securities dealers deemed creditworthy by the adviser the funds custodian or subcustodian will take possession of the securities subject to repurchase agreements the adviser or subcustodian will monitor the value of the underlying security each day to ensure that the value of the security always equals or exceeds the repurchase price repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks reverse repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements are repurchase agreements in which a fund is the seller rather than the buyer of the securities and agrees to repurchase them at an agreed upon time and price a reverse repurchase agreement may be viewed as a type of borrowing by a fund reverse repurchase agreements are subject to credit risks in addition reverse repurchase agreements create leverage risks because a fund must repurchase the underlying security at a higher price regardless of the market value of the security at the time of repurchase delayed delivery transactions delayed delivery transactions including when issued transactions are arrangements in which a fund buys securities for a set price with payment and delivery of the securities scheduled for a future time during the period between purchase and settlement no payment is made by the fund to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund the fund records the transaction when it agrees to buy the securities and reflects their value in determining the price of its shares settlement dates may be a month or more after entering into these transactions so that the market values of the securities bought may vary from the purchase prices therefore delayed delivery transactions create interest rate risks for the fund delayed delivery transactions also involve credit risks in the event of a counterparty default these transactions create leverage risks to be announced securities tbas as with other whenissued transactions a seller agrees to issue a tba security at a future date however the seller does not specify the particular securities to be delivered instead a fund agrees to accept any security that meets specified terms for example in a tba mortgagebacked transaction a fund and the seller would agree upon the issuer interest rate and terms of the underlying mortgages however the seller would not identify the specific underlying mortgages until it issues the security tba mortgagebacked securities increase interest rate risks because the underlying mortgages may be less favorable than anticipated by the fund dollar rolls dollar rolls are transactions where a fund sells mortgage backed securities with a commitment to buy similar but not identical mortgagebacked securities on a future date at a lower price normally one or both securities involved are tba mortgagebacked securities dollar rolls are subject to interest rate risks and credit risks securities lending a fund may lend portfolio securities to borrowers that the adviser deems creditworthy in return the fund receives cash or liquid securities from the borrower as collateral the borrower must furnish additional collateral if the market value of the loaned securities increases also the borrower must pay the fund the equivalent of any dividends or interest received on the loaned securities the fund will reinvest cash collateral in securities that qualify as an acceptable investment for the fund however the fund must pay interest to the borrower for the use of cash collateral loans are subject to termination at the option of the fund or the borrower the fund will not have the right to vote on securities while they are on loan but it will terminate a loan in anticipation of any important vote the fund may pay administrative and custodial fees in connection with a loan and may pay a negotiated portion of the interest earned on the cash collateral to a securities lending agent or broker securities lending activities are subject to interest rate risks and credit risks these transactions create leverage risks investing in securities of other investment companies r the funds may invest its assets in securities of other investment companies including the securities of money market funds affiliated with federated investors as an efficient means of carrying out its investment policies and managing its uninvested cash these other investment companies are managed independently of the funds and incur additional expenses therefore any such investment by the funds may be subject to duplicate expenses however the adviser believes that the benefits and efficiencies of this approach should outweigh the additional expenses the small company growth fund growth fund balanced fund and bond fund may also invest in etfs as with traditional mutual funds etfs charge assetbased fees although these fees tend to be relatively low etfs do not charge initial sales charges or redemption fees and investors pay only customary brokerage fees to buy and sell etf shares r investment ratings for investment grade securities the adviser will determinate whether a security is investment grade based upon the credit ratings given by one or more nationally recognized rating services for example standard and poors a rating service assigns ratings to investment grade securities aaa aa a and bbb based on their assessment of the likelihood of the issuers inability to pay interest or principal default when due on each security lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk if a security has not received a rating a fund must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment that the security is comparable to investment grade investment risks there are many factors which may effect an investment in a fund the funds principal risks are described in its prospectus additional risk factors are outlined below small west company virginia growth growth balanced bond municipal risks fund fund fund fund bond fund interest rate risks x x x x x credit risks x

liquidity risks x x x x x exchange traded funds risks x x x x west virginia risks x interest rate risks  o prices of fixed income securities rise and fall in response to interest rate changes for similar securities generally when interest rates rise prices of fixed income securities fall however market factors such as the demand for particular fixed income securities may cause the price of certain fixed income securities to fall while the prices of other securities rise or remain unchanged o interest rate changes have a greater effect on the price of fixed income securities with longer durations duration measures the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates credit risks o credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will default on a security by failing to pay interest or principal when due if an issuer defaults a fund will lose money o many fixed income securities receive credit ratings from services such as standard  poors and moodys investor services these services assign ratings to securities by assessing the likelihood of issuer default lower credit ratings correspond to higher credit risk if a security has not received a rating a fund must rely entirely upon the advisers credit assessment o fixed income securities generally compensate for greater credit risk by paying interest at a higher rate the difference between the yield of a security and the yield of a us treasury security with a comparable maturity the spread measures the additional interest paid for risk spreads may increase generally in response to adverse economic or market conditions a securitys spread may also increase if the securitys rating is lowered or the security is perceived to have an increased credit risk an increase in the spread will cause the price of the security to decline o credit risk includes the possibility that a party to a transaction involving a fund will fail to meet its obligations this could cause a fund to lose the benefit of the transaction or prevent a fund from selling or buying other securities to implement its investment strategy call risks o call risk is the possibility that an issuer may redeem a fixed income security before maturity a call at a price below its current market price an increase in the likelihood of a call may reduce the securitys price o if a fixed income security is called a fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in other fixed income securities with lower interest rates higher credit risks or other less favorable characteristics leverage risks o leverage risk is created when an investment exposes a fund to a level of risk that exceeds the amount invested changes in the value of such an investment magnify the funds risk of loss and potential for gain risks related to company size o generally the smaller the market capitalization of a company the fewer the number of shares traded daily the less liquid its stock and the more volatile its price market capitalization is determined by multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current market price per share o companies with smaller market capitalizations also tend to have unproven track records a limited product or service base and limited access to capital these factors also increase risks and make these companies more likely to fail than larger well capitalized companies risks of foreign investing o foreign securities pose additional risks because foreign economic or political conditions may be less favorable than those of the united states securities in foreign markets may also be subject to taxation policies that reduce returns for us investors o foreign companies may not provide information including financial statements as frequently or to as great an extent as companies in the united states foreign companies may also receive less coverage than united states companies by market analysts and the financial press in addition foreign countries may lack uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards or regulatory requirements comparable to those applicable to us companies these factors may prevent a fund and its adviser from obtaining information concerning foreign companies that is as frequent extensive and reliable as the information available concerning companies in the united states o foreign countries may have restrictions on foreign ownership of securities or may impose exchange controls capital flow restrictions or repatriation restrictions which could adversely affect the liquidity of a funds investments currency risks o exchange rates for currencies fluctuate daily the combination of currency risk and market risk tends to make securities traded in foreign markets more volatile than securities traded exclusively in the us o the adviser attempts to manage currency risk by limiting the amount a fund invests in securities denominated in a particular currency however diversification will not protect a fund against a general increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies risks of investing in derivative contracts o a funds use of derivative contracts involves risks different from or possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments first changes in the value of the derivative contracts in which a fund invests may not be correlated with changes in the value of the underlying asset or if they are correlated may move in the opposite direction than originally anticipated second while some strategies involving derivatives may reduce the risk of loss they may also reduce potential gains or in some cases result in losses by offsetting favorable price movements in portfolio holdings third there is a risk that derivatives contracts may be mispriced or improperly valued and as a result a fund may need to make increased cash payments to the counterparty finally derivative contracts may cause a fund to realize increased ordinary income or shortterm capital gains which are treated as ordinary income for federal income tax purposes and as a result may increase taxable distributions to shareholders derivative contracts may also involve other risks such as stock market credit liquidity and leverage risks liquidity risks o trading opportunities are more limited for equity securities that are not widely held this may make it more difficult to sell or buy a security at a favorable price or time consequently a fund may have to accept a lower price to sell a security sell other securities to raise cash or give up an investment opportunity any of which could have a negative effect on a funds performance infrequent trading of securities may also lead to an increase in their price volatility o liquidity risk also refers to the possibility that a fund may not be able to sell a security or close out a derivative contract when it wants to if this happens a fund will be required to continue to hold the security or keep the position open and the fund could incur losses o otc derivative contracts generally carry greater liquidity risk than exchangetraded contracts r exchangetraded funds risks o an investment in an etf generally presents the same primary risks as an investment in a conventional fund ie one that is not exchange traded that has the same investment objectives strategies and policies the price of an etf can fluctuate up or down and a fund could lose money investing in an etf if the prices of the securities owned by the etf go down in addition etfs may be subject to the following risks that do not apply to conventional funds i the market price of an etfs shares may trade above or below their net asset value ii an active trading market for an etfs shares may not develop or be maintained or iii trading of an etfs shares may be halted if the listing exchanges officials deem such action appropriate the shares are delisted from the exchange or the activation of marketwide circuit breakers which are tied to large decreases in stock prices halts stock trading generally west virginia investment risks because it is invested primarily in securities issued by the state of west virginia its local governments and their agencies the west virginia municipal bond fund is subject to the risks of west virginias economy and the financial conditions of the state and local government and agencies in  west virginia had approximately  citizens a decrease from  of  persons or  compared to a  increase nationally the  age group made up  of the states population in  making it the third oldest in the nation behind florida and pennsylvania of the states citizens over  years old  had completed high school or an equivalency program and  had obtained bachelor degrees compared to national figures of  and  respectively the states median household income in  was  an increase of  from  compared to a national increase of  although this increase was comparable to the national increase west virginia still ranked th in the nation for median household income west virginias economy is heavily dependent on industries such as coal mining chemicals and manufacturing which are undergoing significant consolidation and change it is also dependent on governmental health and similar service industries in many rural counties in the state the area hospital and the local school board are the primary employers however most of the states hospitals are operating on slim margins and the school enrollment is declining in most areas in  services made up  of the states earnings while government accounted for  and retail trade accounted for  since  manufacturing jobs have steadily declined while service jobs have moved in lockstep upward in  manufacturing accounted for  of the states earnings the current ratio of service to manufacturing jobs is about to the steel industry in the state like most of the domestic steel industry has suffered losses the coal industry on the other hand has received a new emphasis from the bush administrations energy policies however the coal industry faces two challenges the kyoto treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and recent litigation significantly curtailing mountaintop mining these may affect the economic feasibility of conducting mining operations in the future although west virginia is ranked second in the nation for coal production the number of employees has decreased from  in  to  in  nevertheless due to the increasingly strong market for coal the coal mining industry added almost  jobs in  and approximately  jobs between  and  the state is also focused on further developing its tourist industry which generated  billion from over  million day visitors and  billion from approximately  million overnight visitors in  a  increase compared to a  increase nationally perhaps one of west virginias largest assets is its surplus of power west virginia has the highest surplus of power generated and not used within the state contrasted with  states and the district of columbia which each had a power deficit during the first  months of  and had to import power west virginia ranks th in net electrical generation while ranking th in electrical consumption generally the state continues to work toward diversification of its economy and improvement of its roads and other infrastructure both efforts have yielded some success in recent years the west virginia council for community and economic development the public organization that devises the strategic plan for state economic development continues to develop a vision shared a plan for building a stronger economy in west virginia one of the components of this plan involves strengthening current industries and recruiting new industries to the state such target industries include energy and environmental technology and plastics biotechnology and information technology which have established a strong presence in the northeast portion of the state since  approximately  new jobs have been created and approximately  billion in new investment has been generated west virginia has focused considerable efforts on infrastructure including roads schools water and sewer since  approximately  billion has been invested in roads and bridges and in  the state issued the last in a series of  million in general obligation road bonds since  a total of  billion has been committed to water and sewer projects and  million to other infrastructure projects across the state despite the aforementioned job creation and new investment the states economy has reflected the national downward trend between  and  the state realized a loss of  businesses and  jobs overall however in  the state added  jobs the unemployment rate in the state dropped from  in  to  in  as the nations rate remained steady from  in january  to  in december  although the average unemployment rate in  was in line with the national rate west virginia posted unemployment rates as low

a fund may be based on estimates of book income for the year book income generally consists solely of the coupon income generated by the portfolio whereas taxbasis income includes gains or losses attributable to currency fluctuation due to differences in the book and tax treatment of fixedincome securities denominated in foreign currencies it is difficult to project currency effects on an interim basis therefore to the extent that currency fluctuations cannot be anticipated a portion of distributions to shareholders could later be designated as a return of capital rather than income

not be liable to the trust the funds or any fund shareholder for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase holding or sale of any security or for anything done or omitted by it except acts or omissions involving willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties imposed upon it by its contract with the trust as required by the  act the funds board has reviewed the funds investment advisory contract the boards decision to approve the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements during its review of the contract the board considers many factors among the most material of which are the funds investment objectives and long term performance the advisers management philosophy personnel and processes the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry comparable fees in the mutual fund industry the range and quality of services provided to the funds and its shareholders by the wesbanco organization in addition to investment advisory services and a funds relationship to other funds in the wesmark family of funds in assessing the advisers performance of its obligations the board also considers whether there has occurred a circumstance or event that would constitute a reason for it to not renew an advisory contract in this regard the board is mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognizes that most shareholders have invested in the funds on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and in the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund the board also considers the compensation and benefits received by the adviser this includes fees received for services provided to the funds by other entities in the wesbanco organization and research services received by the adviser from brokers that execute fund trades as well as advisory fees in this regard the board is aware that various courts have interpreted provisions of the  act and have indicated in their decisions that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers compensation the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of a fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize economies of scale as a fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with a fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts bearing on the advisers service and fee the funds board is aware of these factors and takes them into account in its review of the funds advisory contract the board considers and weighs these circumstances and is assisted in its deliberations by the advice of independent legal counsel in this regard the board requests and receives a significant amount of information about the funds and the wesbanco organization wesbanco provides much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnishes additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contracts occurs in between regularly scheduled meetings the board may receive information on particular matters as the need arises thus the boards evaluation of an advisory contract is informed by reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy personnel and processes the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or peer group funds and comments on the reasons for performance a funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of a fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading a funds portfolio securities the

standard methods for calculating performance applicable to all mutual funds the sec also permits this standard performance information to be accompanied by nonstandard performance information unless otherwise stated any quoted share performance reflects the effect of nonrecurring charges such as maximum sales charges which if excluded would increase the total return and yield the performance of shares depends upon such variables as portfolio quality average portfolio maturity type and value of portfolio securities changes in interest rates changes or differences in the funds expenses and various other factors share performance fluctuates on a daily basis largely because net earnings andor the value of portfolio holdings fluctuate daily both net earnings and offering price per share

municipal bond fund as adjusted to reflect the funds expenses the ctf was not registered under the  act and was therefore not subject to the restrictions under the  act if the ctf had been registered under the  act the performance may have been adversely affected total return total return represents the change expressed as a percentage in the value of shares over a specific period of time and includes the reinvestment of income and capital gains distributions the average annual total return for shares is the average compounded rate of return for a given period that would equate a  initial investment to the ending redeemable value of that investment the ending redeemable value is computed by multiplying the number of shares owned at the end of the period by the nav per share at the end of the period the number of shares owned at the end of the period is based on the number of shares purchased at the beginning of the period with  less any applicable sales charge adjusted over the period by any additional shares assuming the annual reinvestment of all dividends and distributions total returns after taxes are calculated in a similar manner but reflect additional standard assumptions required by the sec when shares of a fund are in existence for less than a year a fund may advertise cumulative total return for that specific period of time rather than annualizing the total return yield the yield of shares is calculated by dividing i the net investment income per share earned by the shares over a day period by ii the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period this number is then annualized using semiannual compounding this means that the amount of income generated during the day period is assumed to be generated each month over a month period and is reinvested every six months the yield does not necessarily reflect income actually earned by shares because of certain adjustments required by the sec and therefore may not correlate to the dividends or other distributions paid to shareholders to the extent investment professional and brokerdealers charge fees in connection with services provided in conjunction with an investment in

payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments

events aabonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit quality the obligors ability to pay interest and repay principal is very strong although not quite as strong as bonds rated aaa

over time by adverse economic changes however business and financial alternatives can be identified which could assist the obligor in satisfying its debt service requirements bbonds are considered highly speculative while bonds in this class are currently meeting debt service requirements the probability of continued timely payment of principal and interest reflects the obligors limited margin

enewsletter archive email signup why choose green century our threepronged approach offers investors the opportunity to make an impact through the power of their investments in a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can    investing in sustainable companies  leading shareholder advocacy program  supporting environmental and public health nonprofits  sustainable investment strategy for  years green century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values green century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental social and governance esg performance may offer financial advantages for example we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment communities in which they operate and public health they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation green century offers three mutual funds the green century msci international index fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental social and governance performance the green century equity fund invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longestrunning socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index the green century balanced fund invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide sri and valuesbased exclusions fossil fuel companies – coal oil and gas nuclear power companies military weapons and civilian firearm companies producers of genetically modified organisms gmos tobacco companies examples of sustainable companies with outstanding esg ratings energy efficiency renewables water treatment  conservation air pollution control sustainable infrastructure and transportation companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts sustainable agriculture companies including organic and natural food suppliers companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain green century uses valuesbased or socially responsible and impact sri investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries this aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal oil and gas companies green century also employs environmental social and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector while some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies green century uses both to deliver high impact investments fossil fuel free investing green century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the us our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest  fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves green century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical andor financial reasons they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for extract process and refine and transmit coal oil and gas as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves as more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind “low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free it might be but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment  since there is no standardized characterization of the term you should review the prospectus see below for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption review the prospectus marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion such as avoiding fossil fuel companies and should be spelled out in the prospectus the prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives investment strategies risks as well as other details without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in green century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus you can review the prospectus of the green century funds by clicking here our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets httpgreencenturystagingwpenginecomwpcontentuploadspdfvideomp     what about performance there are growing concerns about investing in coal oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices capital expenditures on highcost projects such as offshore and arctic drilling and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets fossil fuel divestment at green

future here are the top five reasons to consider divesting from fossil fuel companies  get your investments in line with your values climate change is a serious threat to our society and burning

passing needed energy policies  may reduce exposure to stranded carbon assets the fossil fuel industry now controls reserves of coal oil and gas that – if extracted and burned – will release five times more carbon dioxide than scientists agree is safe if governments restrict carbon emissions companies owning those fossil fuel reserves may not be able to extract and sell them the reserves may become stranded assets and investors may then be left with devalued assets divesting now could allow investors to reduce their exposure to a possible collapse of the socalled “carbon bubble”  reinvest

a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can    investing in sustainable companies  leading shareholder advocacy program  supporting environmental and public health nonprofits  sustainable investment strategy for  years green century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values green century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental social and governance esg performance may offer financial advantages for example we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment communities in which they operate and public health they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation green century offers three mutual funds the green century msci international index fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental social and governance performance the green century equity fund invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longestrunning socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index the green century balanced fund invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide sri and valuesbased exclusions fossil fuel companies – coal oil and gas nuclear power companies military weapons and civilian firearm companies producers of genetically modified organisms gmos tobacco companies examples of sustainable companies with outstanding esg ratings energy efficiency renewables water treatment  conservation air pollution control sustainable infrastructure and transportation companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts sustainable agriculture companies including organic and natural food suppliers companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain green century uses valuesbased or socially responsible and impact sri investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries this aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal oil and gas companies green century also employs environmental social and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector while some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies green century uses both to deliver high impact investments fossil fuel free investing green century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the us our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest  fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves green century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical andor financial reasons they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for extract process and refine and transmit coal oil and gas as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves as more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind “low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free it might be but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment  since there is no standardized characterization of the term you should review the prospectus see below for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption review the prospectus marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion such as avoiding fossil fuel companies and should be spelled out in the prospectus the prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives investment strategies risks as well as other details without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in green century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus you can review the prospectus of the green century funds by clicking here our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets httpgreencenturystagingwpenginecomwpcontentuploadspdfvideomp     what about performance there are growing concerns about investing in coal oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices capital expenditures on highcost projects such as offshore and arctic drilling and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets fossil fuel
