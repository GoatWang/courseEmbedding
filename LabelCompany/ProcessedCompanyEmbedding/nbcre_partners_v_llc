company by eric feigenbaum deciding between an llp and an llc has to do with managing liabilities michael hitoshidigital visiongetty images related articles  difference  what is the difference between an llc  an llp  llc vs limited liability partnership  llc vs limited liability partnership  limited partnership  what is the difference between a limited partnership  a limited liability partnership  liability partnership advantages  limited liability partnership advantages  disadvantages limited liability companies allow you to enjoy the liability protections of a corporation with many of the structural and tax advantages of a partnership most states offer both limited liability company and limited liability partnership formations while the two have some commonalities they also have some very distinct differences particularly with regard to liability exposure your choice may depend largely on your business type and your goals limited liability company llc owners called members can manage their businesses or hire professional managers in addition llcs enjoy a lot of flexibility for instance they can have as many members as they like and corporations are allowed to be members llcs enjoy freedom from the statemandated membership and management reporting requirements that corporations have most important llcs do not have to pay taxes instead their profits and losses are passed through to their members individual tax returns in the same way as a partnership as a result members enjoy the advantages of avoiding the double taxation of corporations as well as receiving tax relief from the poor performance of their llcs limited liability partnership llps have the same tax advantages of llcs they cannot however have corporations as owners perhaps the most significant difference between llcs and llps is that llps must have at least one managing partner who bears liability for the partnerships actions with an llp whoever is in charge is legally exposed in the same way owners of a simple partnership are exposed silent partners and investors in an llp receive liability protection as long as they do not take on a managerial role if they do a court could pierce the veil of liability protection common types of llp the most common type of llp is a professional business law firms and sometimes group medical practices use the llp format when a founding partner or group of partners are in charge and run the firm while other partners are silent and have bought in as they have earned partnership status because junior partners have no real say over the direction of the firm aside from their personal practice the llp protects them from any problems caused by managements decisions managing partners usually own a significantly larger share of the company than junior or silent partners common types of llc small businesses of all kinds use the llc format many states require businesses with more than one owner to form as an llc so the form is ideal for small to midsize businesses with multiple owners compared to simple partnerships llcs offer the benefit of a separation between personal and legal assets and liabilities however llcs must report their revenues and earnings annually to the internal revenue service in a form  which the irs then uses to check against members tax filings unlike simple partnerships llcs must register with their state secretary of state llcs enjoy the same advantage as simple partnerships in being able to structure and run themselves in an way they see fit all owners are protected from financial liability regardless of whether they play an active role in the direction of the company irs recognition as far as the irs is concerned llcs dont exist as a taxfiling entity when it comes to tax reporting by default llcs report as partnerships do  like llps alternatively the irs allows llcs to elect to report income as corporations do llcs usually report as partnerships since thats the key to passthrough taxation and avoiding double taxation references  legalzoon advantages of an llpllccom llc or incuniversity of north carolina at charlotte llcs vs llpsirs limited liability companynolo limited
