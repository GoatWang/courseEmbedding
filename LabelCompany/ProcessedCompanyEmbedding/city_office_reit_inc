portfolio and in this article we will provide the research that resulted in our latest pickwe are adding cio to our small cap reit portfolio as we believe there is some alpha that can be generatedwe model cio to return  by the end of sometimes good things come in small sizes but they dont always stick out like a sore thumb i wish it was easy but the facts are clear you have to work hard to find the real gems it should be no surprise then that when the reit market rallies its led by the institutional buyers that have a much higher degree of analyst coverage and much lower risk tolerances alternatively smallcap reits have always been seen as riskier bets than large caps in my newsletter forbes real estate investor we own a number of small cap reits and we have been pleased with the yeartodate performance that has returned  our top five smallcap reits have returned over  year to date and our  small cap is preferred apartment communitiesnysemktapts  up  year to date we also had some pain in our small cap reit portfolio new senior nysesnr returned  see article here and chatham lodging nysecldt returned  year to date we still see value in these companies and hopefully they will be our top performers in  it stands to reason small caps are more susceptible to wide swings in price due to lower trading volumes this greater volatility deters action and often invites selling this lack of visibility means unexpected news about a small cap can cause a spike in its share price in addition when mutual funds and other large investors buy or sell many shares at once it can cause volatility in a stock with a small market cap but these apparent drawbacks have little effect on returns for longterm holders we are adding a new company to our portfolio and in this article we will provide the research that resulted in our latest pick city office reit is poised to profit city office reit city office reit nysecio is a newly organized maryland corporation formed on november   to acquire own and operate highquality office properties located within its specified markets in the united states based in vancouver canada cio listed on the nyse on april   over two years ago by raising  million at a price of  per share it is the smallest office reit in our research lab see the last ticker on the left below cio owns  properties  million square feet located in growing markets with strong fundamentals the buildings are located in seattle portland boise phoenix salt lake city denver dallas san antonio austin houston tampa and orlando to be clear cio is very small  all of the properties owned by the reit generate annual noi of just  million the company focuses on assets valued at  million with targeted cap rates of  we have not been a big fan of traditional office reits as we have favored more stable medical office building reits like healthcare trust of america nysehta and physicians realty trust nysedoc however we do like the favorable job growth that will ultimately lead to better credit quality and attractive rent growth population growth is the real driver and as illustrated below cio is focused on markets with strong economic fundamentals and demographics here is a snapshot of the current portfolio note the inplace occupancy is  and the weighted average gross rental rate per square foot is  around  of the reits portfolio revenue is generated from government agencies investmentgrade companies or their subsidiaries the largest tenant is the state of colorado that generates  of cios annual base rent or abr since the ipo since it went public in april  the company has increased square footage by over  million square feet also ffo has increased by  per share from  to  while decreasing the core ffo payout ratio from  to  in september  cio acquired  office center in dallas tx this square foot building is  leased and was acquired at a yearone cap rate of  in september  cio acquired intellicenter in tampa fl this square foot building is  leased and it was acquired at a  cap rate in february  the company internalized management by acquiring the external advisor for  shares of cio stock plus  million this provides enhanced alignment with investors and creates fewer conflicts of interest the balance sheet from a liquidity standpoint cio closed on a  million equity raise on april th at quarter end prior to the equity raise the company had cash of approximately  million and approximately  million remaining undrawn and authorized under its current  million credit facility cio also had  million of restricted cash available to fund future tis lcs and capital projects cios total debt net of deferred financing costs was  million or  million when deducting the noncontrolling interest share of certain debts the companys net debttoenterprise value was  as of q the net proceeds from the followon offering were used to pay down all of the floating rate debt and contributed approximately  million to the cash balance cio said it expects to acquire between  million and  million over the coming quarters the company has no debt maturities in  and  the conservative debt structure  fixed rate has an average debt maturity of  years with a weighted average interest rate of  also it has stable longterm lease contracts year weighted average remaining lease term with wellstaggered leases the earnings wrap as cio communicated on the last few calls the first half of  will be a transitional period  square feet of space is under construction for st lukes and kaiser foundation at cios washington group plaza and amberglen properties no rent was received from these tenants during the first quarter while their space was being completed despite the rent drag the reit maintained strong core ffo of  for the quarter which was slightly ahead of expectations also excluding the two properties cios samestore net operating income from other properties grew an impressive  over the prior quarter cios firstquarter affo was  million or  per share affo was negatively affected by the straightline rent adjustments of  million of which the dun  bradstreet corporation lease at corporate parkway and the united healthcare lease at  center represents  million and  million respectively due to anticipated free rent periods that were disclosed on the companys guidance on the last earnings call these amounts will continue into q and by q the straightline rent adjustments will return to lower levels we point this out primarily because we want to explain the dividend safety and payout ratio for ffo and affo cio has paid  per share in dividends since going public in april  in  cios affo payout ratio was  and in q we can see that the payout ratio is now above  as noted above the company attributed that to straightline rent reporting and also as mentioned cio has several new large leases coming online in q and q the q ffo payout ratio is  much lower than the ffo payout in most of  around  initiating a buy beware its a small cap as noted above we are adding cio to our small cap reit portfolio as we believe there is some alpha that can be generated however we must reiterate that this company is tiny and shares could move up or down as the wind blows although we have a limited history to rely on we like the robust growth profile  million in acquisitions since ipo and the fact that management and directors own  as of q heres how the company has performed since the ipo heres how cio can be valued based on the current dividend yield heres how cio is valued based on pffo multiples to sum it all up city office reit is cheap yes bargains are sometimes inexpensive because they have no shelf space it appears there are just three analysts covering the company four if you count us but we believe there are other catalysts besides lack of wall street coverage from a macro prospective we believe job growth and population growth support more demand for highquality office space as cio continues to grow we believe the diversification will enhance the safety of the dividend and the company will be able to generate dividend growth the quality of cios revenue appears strong and we like the fact that management has internalized operations further suggesting an alignment of interest we model cio to return  by the end of  although we would like to see our small cap reit portfolio produce similar results we must maintain adequate diversification and thus our initial investment in cio will be of modest proportions forbes real estate investor subscribers will see the new company added in the july edition as
