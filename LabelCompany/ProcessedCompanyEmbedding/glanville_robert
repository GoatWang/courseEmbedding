reviews nicolia john pattorney john n ratedjohn paul nicoliaback to profileabout me a career of hundreds of clients one at a time™ please allow me to tell you a bit about my law practice of  years i concentrate in personal injury law and have had my own firm since  some may remember me with the firm of nicholas perot where i also practiced personal injury from i have settled millions of dollars worth of negligenceinsurance claims for clients ranging from auto accidents to dog bites to just about any type of personal injurymy advertising is mostly word of mouth and i take pride in the fact that i am accessible straightforward and i am told a great listener and easy to confide inand i do not hide behind my secretary meaning that it is my priority to promptly take and return calls i can be reached  at  or   and i consider my hundreds of injured clients and their concerned families over my lengthy career to be confidential friends as much as confidential clientsand most importantly each case is as unique as the next and i never take a client for granted hence my motto  a career of hundreds of clients one at a time any past clients or new clients feel free to call day or night to arrange for a free consultation or to just keep in touch and always feel free to have someone you know call me to privately talk about any type of legal issue which is of concern to them or youand make it my concern as wellsargent  collinsalex n ratedmy experience with sargent  collins was positive they represented me three times in real estate transactions for the past five years the initial contact with nicholas sargent was always brief i briefly explain my need to the secretary nicholas returns my call in the same business day we speak about property and the contract and he gives me a quote the rest of the interaction typically goes through one of the paralegals i like that i can call or email or pdf or fax i think overall they represented me in a professional manner were flexible where it was necessary and charged a very reasonable amount for the service prior to working with sargent  collins i hired a lawyer who bitterly disappointed me on my request to process contract as fast as possible he quietly left for  month vacation required me to attend city clerks office to pay and process documentation and charged me almost twice as much after that experience working with sargent  collins brought a much needed relief can i recommend sargent  collins i believe  yes lawyers are not your friends but as long as your request is legitimate and you act professionally i believe sargent  collins will treat you right randy s margulis esq attorney at lawjayshearer ratedhe is such a personable lawyerhe is such a personable lawyer i had a situation concerning custody and needed to be represented i had a public defender before him and the guy was hopeless i retained randy and he ensured my needs and intentions were fulfilled he returned every phone call and kept me
