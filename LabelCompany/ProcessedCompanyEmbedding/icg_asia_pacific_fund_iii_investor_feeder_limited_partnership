analysis for asiapacific hedge fund managers legal and tax structuring in hong kong and singapore insightlegal asia consulting hong kong singapore april   hong kong and singapore remain keenly competitive jurisdictions that seek to attract hedge fund managers far outpacing other apac jurisdictions  however the requirements for and benefits of setting up hedge funds and investment management structures differ between the two  insightlegal asia consulting wwwinsightlegalasiacom specializes in ‘clarifying complexity’ and herein we examine the key legal and tax structuring issues that investment managers should consider when setting up a hedge fund or fund management company in hong kong and singapore specifically our objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the two regimes by identifying certain material legal and tax issues that should be addressed upfront when considering an asiapacific presence   introduction hong kong and singapore compete openly in most segments of the financial markets and hedge funds are no exception  in this discussion we seek to answer the following question what are the key benefits and disadvantages of selecting hong kong as opposed to singapore from a hedge fund managers’ perspective in so doing we i first examine the legal and regulatory issues associated with setting up a hedge fund and fund management company in hong kong  then ii we apply the same analysis to the singaporean context  finally we iii consider the most material legal and tax issues likely to arise when structuring a hedge fund and techniques for addressing them proactivelyand prophylactically—rather than retroactively in litigation or investigation part one structuring a hedge fund in hong kong hong kong overview let us begin by highlighting certain obvious advantages offered by hong kong as a location for hedge fund managers hong kong is china’s premier offshore financial center and in addition to serving as the preeminent prc gateway is a regional hub for prime brokerage custodial and administrative services hong kong’s favourable low tax system grants tax exemptions to offshore funds except for profits tax on hk “sourced” income in terms of dividends capital gains and interest income furthermore there is no stamp duty on nonhk share transfers fund managers are well regulated which is beneficial since it lends international credibility to compliant hedge fund managers hong kong’s legal system and recognizable common law heritage is a strength providing stability coupled with a highly marketoriented government and  hong kong does not restrict hedge fund managers in terms of strategies especially in the exempt and institutional segments of the market hong kong’s regulatory framework “hedge funds” in hong kong essentially hong kong’s securities and futures ordinance “sfo” treats all funds as collective investment schemes “cis” which encompasses mutual funds hedge funds structured investments aka structured products unlisted structured investments and mpf and orso schemes mandatory mutual fund schemes for employees the main effect resulting from hong kong’s regulatory approach of placing of all of the above funds under a single cis regime is that offshore funds are overwhelmingly used eg cayman bvi and bermuda due to the limited choice of hk domiciled fund structures ie less aggressive permissible strategies and slower authorization processes importantly from a tax standpoint a fund will be considered nonresident for hong kong tax purposes and thus exempt from hong kong profits tax if the “central management and control” of such fund is exercised outside hong kong even though transactions are executed through intermediaries regulated by the securities and futures commission “sfc” in specified asset classes namely securities futures and fx for an analysis of hong kong tax considerations at the fund manager structuring level please refer to the discussion in part three licensing the submanager is based in hong kong will be required under the sfo to obtain type  license asset management  alternatively a type  license advising on securities or type  license advising on futures contracts may be required in certain cases which is potentially attractive in that they present lower regulatory hurdles  the key components to obtain an sfc license are as follows business plancompliance manual  these documents set out the nature and scope of the business operational workflow organizational structure and internal controls  they demonstrate to the sfc that the firm i understands its business ii has the experience and systems to manage the business and its risks and that it iii will be able to comply with sfc regulatory requirements internal controls  the firm’s risk management compliance valuation and conflict of interest policies and procedures are examined by the sfc but firms whose parents are licensed or registered by the us securities and exchange commission or the uk financial services authority are typically fasttracked capital requirements  a firm licensed for asset management is required to have paidup capital “puc” of hk and to maintain liquid capital of at least hk  if the firm does not hold client assets there are no puc requirements and liquid capital requirements can be reduced to as low as hk responsible officers  every licensed firm must have  individuals approved by the sfc as responsible officers “ros”  at least  ro must fully satisfy the sfc that they have adequate local regulatory knowledge industry knowledge relevant experience and management experience  typically the fund manager himself will be a ro licensing exam  the ro must pass a regulatory examinationunless exemptwhich usually applies to individuals who are or have previously been licensed as a ro are normally exempt from the regulatory examination  the following individuals are eligible for exemption at the sfc’s discretion if the individual is licensed or registered for investment management or advisory business in the us or uk or has more than  years of relevant experience in other recognized markets the firm for which the individual will act as ro will only serve professional investors the firm is able to confirm that regulatory and compliance support will be provided to the individual and the individual takes a postlicensing refresher course on local regulations relevant experience to satisfy the requirement for relevant experience the sfc generally requires a ro to have at least  years of experience in the management of public funds ie cis sold to the public proprietary trading alternative investments or investment research marketing offers and invitations to the public to acquire shares or other interests in hedge funds are subject to regulatory authorization requirementsunless exempt  although the sfc has a regulatory framework for the authorization of hedge funds it is rarely used  fund managers prefer to rely on exemptions to save time and to have greater flexibility in terms of capitalraising investor reporting and investment strategies  the most commonly used exemptions are as follows professional investors  sfc authorization may not be required if the hedge fund is sold only to professional investors “pis”  pis includes institutional investors and noninstitutional investors  the former includes bankers dealers insurance companies and certain regulated cis the latter includes high net worth individuals “hnwis” meaning individuals with a portfolio of not less than hk million corporations whose sole business is to hold investments and which are whollyowned by hnwis as defined above corporations or partnerships with a portfolio of not less than hk million or total assets of not less than hk million trust corporations registered under the trustee ordinance or regulated under the laws of a place outside hong kong having total assets under  sophisticated investors marketing materials for a hedge fund structured as a company may be exempt from the authorization requirements if the shares are offered only to persons whose ordinary business is to buy or sell shares or debentures whether as principal or agent minimun subscription marketing materials of a hedge fund structured as a company may be exempt from the authorization requirement if i the materials contain a prescribed warning statement and ii the minimum denomination or the minimum consideration payable by any person for the shares to be subscribed is not less than hk part two structuring a hedge fund in singapore singapore hedge fund overview singapore has established itself as a key hedge fund center and competes closely with hong kong for market share  the growth of hedge funds in singapore can be specifically attributed to several factors including excellent tax and regulatory incentives for fund managers in sharp contrast to the eu’s taxation juggernauts and the illconceived directive on alternative investment fund managers “aifmd” the monetary authority of singapore “mas” proactively promotes singapore as a hedge fund hub without overburdening startups with excessive licensing and other regulatory hurdles singaporean regulations are efficient and clear thereby providing faster licensing and access to the market and singapore’s stable economy skilled workforce reasonable industry regulations and a probusiness environment complement the hedge fund industry singapore’s regulatory framework “hedge funds” in singapore according to the mas’s code on collective investment schemes “ccis” “there are different characteristics and investment strategies that define hedge funds  generally speaking a hedge fund seeks to deliver an “absolute” return independent of the directional move of equity fixed income or cash markets  in considering whether a fund constitutes a hedge fund the mas will consider whether the fund engages in strategies that use leverage short selling arbitrage or derivatives and involves investment in nonmainstream asset classes ie investments other than listed equities bonds and cash hedge fund structures – onshore and offshore   onshore funds  a fund constituted in singapore is subject to the hedge fund licensing and regulatory regime of singapore  onshore funds can be marketed to both domestic investors as well as foreign investors although in practice they are primarily marketed to domestic retail investors the permitted fund structures for onshore funds are as follows closeended funds ie corporations openended unit trust funds and limited liability partnerships “llps” offshore funds  funds constituted in offshore jurisdictions are subject to offshore legislation  offshore funds can be offered to domestic investors in singapore subject to certain conditions  sophisticated investors typically prefer offshore funds as they offer a degree of privacy   licensing onshore fund managers and distributors small fund managers with less than  qualified investors are exempt from licensing requirements  to conduct one or more of the regulated financial services activities all other fund managers and distributors unless otherwise exempt need to hold a single license which is either i a capital markets services license or ii a financial advisers license the securities and futures act “sfa” regulates the following activities and issues a capital markets services licence “cmsl” to persons engaged in dealing in securities trading in futures contracts leveraged foreign exchange trading  advising on corporate finance fund management real estate investment trust reit management securities financing and providing custodial services for securities the financial advisers act “faa” regulates the following activities and issues a financial advisers licence “fal” to persons engaged in providing advice on investment products including securities which includes unit trusts futures contracts foreign exchange and leveraged foreign exchange contracts and life insurance policies which includes investmentlinked life insurance products and structured products issuing reports on investment products marketing collective investment schemes ie unit trusts and arranging life insurance products except for fund managers with less than  qualified investors or those who are exempted under other conditions any corporation or person who wishes to carry on business in any of the above regulated activities needs to obtain the requisite cmslfal license or cmslfal representative license  a hedge fund manager operating under the exemption can market funds managed by itself but cannot market thirdparty funds without a license  importantly there are no capital requirements for fund managers operating under an exemption  however exempt managers are required to comply with similar market conduct and practices as licensed bodies offshore fund managers offshore fund managers marketing offshore funds to singapore investors must be licensed or regulated in the offshore jurisdiction and must be ‘fit and proper’ as per the mas guidelines on fit and proper criteria marketing onshore funds to retail investors disclosure requirements  all hedge fund marketing material including the cover page of the hedge fund prospectus should disclose the inherent risks of investing in a hedge fund and important information such as some investments may not be actively traded and may involve uncertainties  only limited information on how the schemes will be managed will be available that there is limited liquidity and most of the underlying hedge funds are subject to minimal regulation  minimum initial subscription requirement  different categories of funds have the following minimum subscription requirements for single hedge funds s per investor for fund of hedge funds “fohf” s per investor and for capital protectedguaranteed hedge funds no minimum subscription amount qualifications of fund managers hedge fund managers should have at least  executives  each executive must have at least  years of hedge fund management experience  an additional requirement of  years fofh management experience is required for managers of fofhs investing in other schemes a singapore single hedge fund may invest in another single hedge fund which is not a feeder fund  similarly a singapore fohf may invest in another fohf which should only invest directly in other hedge funds and not through another fohf or feeder fund  limited liability  the liability of investors must be limited to their investment in the scheme diversification of fohfs  a fohf should be diversified across at least  hedge fund managers offshore funds to retail investors an offshore fund can be marketed to retail investors in singapore subject to the following conditions the fund must be recognized by the mas  the fund manager must be licensed or regulated in the offshore jurisdiction where its principal place of business is based and must be ‘fit and proper’ the offshore fund’s prospectus or profile statement must be approved by the mas the offshore jurisdiction in which the scheme is constituted must offer adequate protection to investors in singapore comparable to that provided by the singapore securities and futures act “sfa” for onshore funds the investment guidelines of the offshore jurisdiction that govern offshore funds must be substantially similar to that of singapore’s  there must be a singapore based representative for the fund to act as a liaison between investors and the foreign manager such representative must be an individual a company incorporated in singapore or a foreign company registered in singapore under the companies act a prospectus in compliance with the sfa must be lodged and registered with the mas and the fund manager together with its related companies must manage at least sm of discretionary funds in singapore the minimum initial subscription requirement for different categories of funds is as follows for single hedge funds s per investor fohfs s per investor and for capital protectedguaranteed hedge funds no minimum subscription amount marketing exemptions marketing onshore and offshore funds to accredited investors and other relevant personsonshore and offshore hedge funds that are marketed to accredited investors as defined in sec a of the sfa do not require the submission of a prospectus or any other offering document to the mas marketing onshore and offshore funds to institutional investors  onshore and offshore hedge funds that are offered to institutional investors as defined in sec a of the sfa are exempt from prospectus requirements and there is no requirement for submitting any other offering document to the mas  furthermore there are no minimum subscription requirements   hedge fund taxation singapore uses a territorial basis for taxation  in other words companies and individuals are taxed on singapore sourced income  foreign sourced income branch profits dividends service income c will be taxed when it is remittedor deemed remittedinto singapore unless the income was already subjected to taxes in a jurisdiction with headline tax rates of at least   although the concept of locality of the source of income seems simple its application can often be complex and contentious  no universal rule applies to every scenario   for a fuller analysis of tax considerations when structuring a singaporean hedge fund see the discussion in part three ivb other incentives enhanced tier fund management scheme  with effect  april  to  march  an enhanced tier was introduced to the existing fund management incentives for funds with a minimum size of s million at the point of application amongst other conditions  under the enhanced tier system restrictions are imposed on neither the residency status of the fund vehicles nor that of investors  the enhanced tier also applies to funds that are constituted in the form of limited partnerships  additionally the  or  investment limit imposed on resident nonindividual investors has been lifted for funds that fall under this enhanced tier part three hedge fund structuring – legal and tax issues overview of structuring the first point of inquiry of fund managers looking at establishing an apac presence concerns where to locate the fund’s management and operations  below we look at the core legal and tax issues relevant to structuring hedge funds in general subsequently we extract aspects of our above analysis of the hk and singapore specific issues to better clarify the structuring options available to hedge fund managers operating in asiapacific key tax and legal issues when structuring a hedge fund how the manager envisages the capitalraising process and where his target investors are likely to be based is the analytical starting point in terms of structuring a hedge fund most importantly will it be a global strategy marketed to a range of global investors is the intent to raise money from us tax payers and us taxexempt investors us tax considerations us investors can be split into two categories us taxable investors  for these investors investing in a hedge fund may be subject to onerous tax rules applicable to investments in a passive foreign investment company “pfic”  these rules penalize the sheltering of passive investment income in a pfic to defer tax  to avoid pfic rules us taxable investors prefer to invest in flowthrough entities such as partnerships or corporations that can elect to be treated as a partnership for us tax purposes and us tax exempt investors for investors in this category eg pension funds endowments c investing in flowthrough entities by contrast may be subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income “ubti” where the fund earns income using leverage  for this reason us tax exempt investors prefer to avoid flowthrough entities such as partnerships and instead opt for a corporation structure in a tax favourable jurisdiction   the former wish to have opaque tax structures eg llps whereas the latter and nonus investors prefer tax transparent structures eg cayman companies  therefore a critical initial distinction is how each legal vehicle will elect to be classified for us tax purposes  typically a manager will wish to establish at least two vehicles to support these different types of investors and such vehicles are commonly referred to as ‘feeder funds’ structuring master feeder funds in a classic masterfeeder fund three separate vehicles comprise the hedge fund a us feeder fund established as a llp in the us a nonus feeder fund established as a corporation in a tax neutral jurisdiction and a master fund established in a tax neutral jurisdiction either as a llp or as a non per se corporation that elects to be treated as a partnership for us tax purposes   under this masterfeeder structure us taxable investors invest in the us feeder fund while nonus investors and us tax exempt investors eg pension funds invest in the nonus feeder fund  both the us feeder fund and the nonus feeder fund then invest all their assets into the master fund which holds all the assets and executes all the trades with the prime brokers  in short the two feeder funds provide a dual entry point into the master fund  european structures for hedge fund managers targeting eu investors the most suitable fund structures are i irish qualifying investor funds “qifs” and ii luxembourg specialized investment funds “sifs”  both qifs and sifs are more flexible than ucits fund structures but not as flexible as cayman fund structures  this eu onshoreregulated route might benefit the hedge fund manager in terms of raising capital but they will have to accept that eu regulators are potentially going to intervene and instruct them to do things differently legal and regulatory issues when structuring the management entity what is often more critical than the structure of the fund itself is the proper establishment of the fund management entity  to be successful this requires a solid management structure and a clear partnership agreement to help avoid potential future disputes and reputational issues  in particular hedge fund disputes tend to originate within the fund management structure as opposed to the funds themselves limited liability partnerships “llp” essentially a taxtransparent corporate entity llps help to avoid double taxation   specifically management fees and incentive fees pass straight through to partners as if they were earning such fees themselves directly ie not through the fund  also the fact that they are partners in the firmnot employeesavoids employee related tax and compensation issues  it is crucial to understand that the success or failure of most llps is determined by the quality of the partnership agreement partnership agreements “pa” the pa must be carefully constructed to address any relevant default provisions that will apply by operation of law in the jurisdiction of the fund manager unless the manager does not specifically exclude them in the pa  examples of material default provisions may include all members may be entitled to share equally in the capital and profits of the llp every member may take part in the management of the llp and no majority of the members can expel any member unless such a power to do so has been expressly conferred in the pa secondly the pa should determine the extent to which duties of good faith are exercised within the partnership  any partnership arrangement is subject to fiduciary duties or duties of good faith  however it is somewhat uncertain the extent to which the partners of an llp owe duties of good faith either to the entity or to individual members another area to consider in the pa is what happens when one of the partners decides to leave the firm  managers should consider buyout options so that each partner is clear on the financial implications of leaving either voluntarily to pursue their own interests or because of a dispute  there should be nothing left open to interpretation in a welldrafted pa finally another difficult area that might arise relates to nonperformance of individuals this can lead to a potentially destabilizing environment but how one defines nonperformance is far from straightforward and should be addressed in the pa profit arrangements in an llp the economic returns of the management company are derived from i management fees typically between one to two per cent of the fund’s aum and ii incentive fees which are typically  per cent of the fund’s profits  these fees go to the llp and the pa must provide for what is termed “residual profit” specifically the amount left over after operational costs regulatory capital requirements remuneration of employees c regulatory considerations this raises the final material issue of consideration when establishing the management companyregulation   for example under the poorly conceived european aifmd that came into effect in july  a deferral mechanism will need to be established which could become an issue  this means that under the pa rather than each partner receiving his full profit allocation profits need to be reinvested back into the fund and distributed back to the partner over a three to fiveyear period however most sophisticated fund managers will rarely use just a uk llp instead they will have a cayman management entity which then appoints a uk llp to operate in an advisory capacity under the aifmd startup managers have to therefore decide whether to structure the management company purely as an llp and fall within the directive or remain outside of it by placing the balance of power with a cayman management entity this structure is useful for managers who succeed in building the business and end up with management entities in for example new york singapore hong kong or london all of which would be contracted to the cayman entity tax considerations in apac hedge fund structures in many instances structuring a hedge fund is driven as much by tax considerations as it is by capitalraising target investors and fund strategies  the fund manager will typically wish to minimize its own tax liability andto facilitate capital raisingensure that the fund’s profits are sheltered whenever possible from tax hong kong based fund managers for hedge fund managers based in hong kong the asset management company or investment manager is typically established in a tax neutral jurisdiction eg cayman bvi and the submanagement company submanager in established in hong kong  this allows the investment manager to delegate discretion over investments to the submanager which in turn employs the local hedge fund manager to manage the fund  under this structure investment management and performance fees go to the asset management company in the tax neutral jurisdiction  the investment manager pays the submanager a small fee which covers the operational costs of the submanager with a modest markup this structure avoids the management and performance fees being taxed by hong kong since hong kong only taxes the submanager on the modest fees earned by it from the offshore asset management company  as one might expect the tax neutral jurisdiction does not tax the management and performance fees earned by the offshore investment manager therefore all such fees remain tax exempt throughout the life of such a structure the presence of a submanager in hong kong who makes discretionary investment decisions on behalf of the fund is unlikelyby itselfto result in the “central management and control” of the fund being deemed to be exercised in hong kong  however to ensure that the “central management and control” standard is not reached it is advisable to hold board meetings outside of hong kong  appoint a majority of nonhong kong directorsand ensure that the board has an actual function singapore based hedge fund managers in relation to hedge funds the place of business will determine the source of income  for instance an offshore hedge fund managed by a singapore based fund manager may be liable to tax in singapore by virtue of the active role played by the fund manager in managing the investments of the fund  in other words the fund will be deemed as “carrying out business in singapore” and income derived from the fund may be considered as singapore sourced incometherefore liable to tax in singapore  however singapore has introduced certain tax incentives and exemptions to reduce or eliminate such tax liability including offshore funds  an offshore fund that is managed by a singaporebased fund manager is exempt from singapore tax on specified income from designated investments provided the offshore fund is a qualifying fund  specified income refers to profits gains dividends and interest from designated investments  designated investments include traditional investments such as stocks shares securities bonds deposits futures contracts c   a qualifying fund is one that is not  beneficially owned by singapore investors including singapore resident individuals singapore resident corporate entities and singaporebased permanent establishments of nonresidents does not have a singapore presence and can only be in the form of companies trusts or individual accounts a qualifying investor also enjoys tax exemptions on income derived from qualifying funds  a qualifying investor is an individual investor or a bona fide nonresident nonindividual investor that does not have a singapore presence or business activity other than as a fund manager has a permanent establishment in singapore but does not use funds from its operation in singapore to invest in the qualifying fund certain specified singapore government entities and a singapore resident corporate investor that owns not more than  or  if the fund has  or more investors of the qualifying fund onshore funds  in  the singapore government introduced the singapore resident fund scheme under which the above mentioned tax exemption scheme for offshore funds was extended to funds constituted in singapore as well subject to the following conditions the fund vehicle must only be a company the fund must be constituted in singapore and have its administration performed in singapore and the fund must be approved by the mas concessionary tax rate for fund managers  under the financial sector incentive scheme for fund managers fund managers in singapore are taxed at a concessionary rate of  on fee income subject to certain conditions and mas approval  this scheme applies to fund managers who employ at least three fund management or investment advisory professionals the professionals’ basic monthly income must exceed s these schemes have bolstered the fund management industry in singapore since it offers the additional advantage of singapore’s extensive treaty network that helps to reduce tax liability in treaty countries that the fund invests in conclusion as is the case elsewhere the essential questions of capitalraising fund strategy tax legal and regulatory issues remain critical to the establishment of fund management structures in apac  within apac hong kong and singapore remain keenly competitive in terms of attracting hedge fund managers and the key features of each jurisdiction in terms of their legal regulatory and tax frameworks have been analyzed above  the domicile of the fund itself remains primarily a matter of tax licensing and marketing concerns whereas the fund management structure is driven by a combination of legal issues involving control of the fund as well as tax implications based on the choice of legal entities and jurisdictions  although there is no onesizefitsall answer to the question posed at the beginning of this comparative analysis hopefully this discussion highlights the more challenging issues that need to assessed and tackled upfront before setting up hedge fund structures in asiapacific—not
