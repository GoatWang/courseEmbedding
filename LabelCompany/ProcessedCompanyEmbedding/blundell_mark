series he even returned to ff for the european championship racing taking pole and finishing fourth overall with  came another championship in ff this time the european title at this point in his career blundell decided it was time to take his continuing success and move on to international racing he bypassed the traditional stepping stone of formula three and started racing in formula  despite having to cope with an underfunded and underpowered car he showed incredible talent and strung together a series of promising results he even started a few races at formula three for tomstoyota showing ability there as well  meant a switch to the works lola team in f at that time one of the biggest teams in the series in a closely contested season blundell managed a very

tyrrell it was not as successful a year as  and blundell managed only one podium finish in the  spanish grand prix which was the last formula one podium finish for tyrrell at the end of the season owing to lack of sponsorship tyrrell released him this would prove to be a blessing in disguise as the retirement of nigel mansell meant a return to mclaren for blundell this time in a race seat teamed with future twotime world champion mika häkkinen blundell recorded five points finishes and once again took tenth in the final standings  also saw continued success in sports cars with a fourth

was an immediate success eventually becoming one of the topranked riders in britain winning a few championships at the age of  he made the switch to four wheels in britains formula ford again he was rewarded with instant success and in his first season he placed second in both british junior formula ford championships despite  wins and  poles the following year mark won both the esso british and snetterton ff crowns the next year he upgraded his ride to the more powerful ff category and promptly won the bbc grandstand series he even returned to ff for the european championship racing taking pole and finishing fourth overall with  came another championship in ff this time the european title at this point in his career blundell decided it was time to take his continuing success and move on to international racing he bypassed the traditional stepping stone of formula three and started racing in formula  despite having to cope with an underfunded and underpowered car he showed incredible talent and strung together a series of promising results he even started a few races at formula three for tomstoyota showing ability there as well  meant a switch to the works lola team in f at that time one of the biggest teams in the series in a closely contested season blundell managed a very respectable sixth place in the final standings formula oneedit the following year he made a deal with the sports car team at nissan landing a factory seat he also managed a test drive with one of the top teams in formula one – williams by  blundell had abandoned f to concentrate on sports cars that same year he earned pole position at the prestigious le mans  hours race driving a nissan rck blundell became the youngest driver to achieve pole position at the le mans  hours with a second margin

world championship standings it was a oneyear deal with ligier however and in  he signed with tyrrell it was not as successful a year as  and blundell managed only one podium finish in the  spanish grand prix which was the last formula one podium finish for tyrrell at the end of the season owing to lack of sponsorship tyrrell released him this would prove to be a blessing in disguise as the retirement of nigel mansell meant a return to mclaren for blundell this time in a race seat teamed with future twotime world champion mika häkkinen blundell recorded five points finishes and once again took tenth in the final standings  also saw continued success in sports cars with a fourth place showing in le mans but was mark blundells final year in formula one as the signing of david

named british driver of the year by autosport magazine  was not a year for the books and a massive crash early in  left him to languish at the bottom of the table he returned to pacwest for a final
