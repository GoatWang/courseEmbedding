smallcap and midcap issuers the fund can invest up to  of its total assets in securities of small unseasoned companies the fund primarily invests in us companies but may also purchase securities of issuers in any country including developed and emerging market countries while the fund has no limits on the percentage of its assets it can invest in foreign securities normally it does not expect to invest substantial amounts of its assets in foreign securities and generally limits investments in emerging markets to not more than  of its total assets the fund emphasizes securities that the portfolio manager believes are undervalued in selecting investments for the fund the portfolio managers look for stocks of small and midcap companies that they believe have been undervalued by the market a security may be undervalued because the market is not aware of the issuers intrinsic value does not yet recognize its future potential or the issuer may be temporarily out of favor the fund seeks to realize gains in the prices of those securities when other investors recognize their real or prospective worth the portfolio managers use a bottom up approach to select securities one at a time before considering industry trends those companies may have a low ratio of their stock price to earnings for example the portfolio managers also analyze factors such as a companys book value sales earnings growth potential and cash flows after considering these criteria the portfolio manager may also look at broader industry and economic trends that could affect the growth potential of particular small and midcap stocks the portfolio managers currently focus on companies with the following characteristics which may vary in particular cases and may change over time ■ favorable supplydemand conditions for key products ■ development of new products or businesses ■ quality of management ■ competitive position in the marketplace ■ effective allocation of capital the fund may sell securities that the portfolio manager believes no longer meet the above criteria but is not required to do so principal risks the price of the funds shares can go up and down substantially the value of the funds investments may change because of broad changes in the markets in which the fund invests or because of poor investment selection which could cause the fund to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives there is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective when you redeem your shares they may be worth more or less than what you paid for them these risks mean that you can lose money by investing in the fund risks of investing in stock the value of a funds portfolio may be affected by changes in the stock markets stock markets may experience significant shortterm volatility and may fall sharply at times adverse events in any part of the equity or fixedincome markets may have unexpected negative effects on other market segments different stock markets may behave differently from each other and us stock markets may move in the opposite direction from one or more foreign stock markets the prices of individual stocks generally do not all move in the same direction at the same time for example growth stocks may perform well under circumstances in which value stocks in general have fallen a variety of factors can affect the price of a particular companys stock these factors may include but are not limited to poor earnings reports a loss of customers litigation against the company general unfavorable performance of the companys sector or industry or changes in government regulations affecting the company or its industry to the extent that securities of a particular type are emphasized for example foreign stocks stocks of small or midsized companies growth or value stocks or stocks of companies in a particular industry its share value may fluctuate more in response to events affecting the market for those types of securities risks of value investing value investing entails the risk that if the market does not recognize that the funds securities are undervalued the prices of those securities might not appreciate as anticipated a value approach could also result in fewer investments that increase rapidly during times of market gains and could cause the fund to underperform funds that use a growth or nonvalue approach to investing value investing has gone in and out of favor during past market cycles and when value investing is out of favor or when markets are unstable the securities of value companies may underperform the securities of growth companies risks of small and midcap companies the stock prices of small and midcap companies may be more volatile and their securities may be more difficult to sell than those of larger companies they may not have established markets may have fewer customers and product lines may have unseasoned management or less management depth and may have more limited access to financial resources smaller companies may not pay dividends or provide capital gains for some time if at all      industry and sector focus  at times the fund may increase the relative emphasis of its investments in a particular industry or sector the prices of stocks of issuers in a particular industry or sector may go up and down in response to changes in economic conditions government regulations availability of basic resources or supplies or other events that affect that industry or sector more than others to the extent that the fund increases the relative emphasis of its investments in a particular industry or sector its share values may fluctuate in response to events affecting that industry or sector to some extent that risk may be limited by the funds policy of not concentrating its investments in any one industry  risks of foreign investing foreign securities are subject to special risks securities traded in foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than those traded in us markets foreign issuers are usually not subject to the same accounting and disclosure requirements that us companies are subject to which may make it difficult for the fund to evaluate a foreign companys operations or financial condition a    change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency and in the value of any income or distributions the fund may receive on those securities the value of foreign investments may be affected by exchange control regulations foreign taxes higher transaction and other costs delays in the settlement of transactions changes in economic or monetary policy in the united states or abroad expropriation or nationalization of a companys assets or other political and economic factors in addition due to the interrelationship of global economies and financial markets changes in political and economic factors in one country or region could adversely affect conditions in another country or region investments in foreign securities may also expose the fund to timezone arbitrage risk foreign securities may trade on weekends or other days when the fund does not price its shares as a result the value of the funds net assets may change on days when you will not be able to purchase or redeem the funds shares at times the fund may emphasize investments in a particular country or region and may be subject to greater risks from adverse events that occur in that country or region foreign securities and foreign currencies held in foreign banks and securities depositories may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight      risks of developing and emerging markets  risks of foreign investing may be greater for investments in developing or emerging market countries developing or emerging market countries may have less welldeveloped securities markets and exchanges that may be substantially less liquid than those of more developed markets settlement procedures in developing or emerging markets may differ from those of more established securities markets and settlement delays may result in the inability to invest assets or to dispose of portfolio securities in a timely manner securities prices in developing or emerging markets may be significantly more volatile than is the case in more developed nations of the world and governments of developing or emerging market countries may also be more unstable than the governments of more developed countries such countries economies may be more dependent on relatively few industries that may be highly vulnerable to local and global changes developing or emerging market countries also may be subject to social political or economic instability the value of developing or emerging market currencies may fluctuate more than the currencies of countries with more mature markets investments in developing or emerging market countries may be subject to greater risks of government restrictions including confiscatory taxation expropriation or nationalization of a companys assets restrictions on foreign ownership of local companies and restrictions on withdrawing assets from the country in addition the ability of foreign entities to participate in privatization programs of certain developing or emerging market countries may be limited by local law investments in securities of issuers in developing or emerging market countries may be considered speculative who is the fund designed for the fund is designed primarily for investors seeking capital appreciation those investors should be willing to assume the risks of shortterm share price fluctuations and losses that are typical for funds emphasizing small and midcap stock investments since the fund does not seek current income and its income from investments will likely be small it is not designed for investors
