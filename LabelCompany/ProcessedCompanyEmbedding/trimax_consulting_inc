     organization history and business   trimax consulting inc “the company” was incorporated in nevada on may   the company was established for the purpose of real estate consulting and the purchasing of tax liens   note      summary of significant accounting policies    revenue recognition   revenue is derived from sales of products to distributors and consumers revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin “sab” no  “revenue recognition in financial statements” as revised by sab no  as such the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title transfer has occurred the price is fixed or readily determinable and collectability is probable sales are recorded net of sales discounts and terms are recorded by contract   accounts receivable   accounts receivable is reported at the customers’ outstanding balances less any allowance for doubtful accounts  interest is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable   allowance for doubtful accounts   an allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses  management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical writeoff percentages and information collected from individual customers  accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired   stock based compensation   when applicable the company will account for stockbased payments to employees in accordance with asc  “stock compensation” “asc ”  stockbased payments to employees include grants of stock grants of stock options and issuance of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant        the company accounts for stockbased payments to nonemployees in accordance with asc  “equitybased payments to nonemployees”  stockbased payments to nonemployees include grants of stock grants of stock options and issuances of warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the value of the vested portion of the award over the requisite service period as measured at its thencurrent fair value as of each financial reporting date   the company calculates the fair value of option grants and warrant issuances utilizing the binomial pricing model  the amount of stockbased compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest  asc  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time stock options are granted and warrants are issued to employees and nonemployees and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates  the term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock option or warrant  the company estimates forfeiture rates for all unvested awards when calculating the expense for the period  in estimating the forfeiture rate the company monitors both stock option and warrant exercises as well as employee termination patterns  the resulting stockbased compensation expense for both employee and nonemployee awards is generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period in which the company expects to receive the benefit which is generally the vesting period   loss per share   the company reports earnings loss per share in accordance with asc topic  earnings per share basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing income loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares available diluted earnings loss per share is computed similar to basic earnings loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive diluted earnings loss per share has not been presented since there are no dilutive securities   cash and cash equivalents   for purpose of the statements of cash flows the company considers cash and cash equivalents to include all stable highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less   concentration of credit risk   the company primarily transacts its business with one financial institution the amount on deposit in that one institution may from time to time exceed the federallyinsured limit         use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   business segments   asc  “segment reporting” requires use of the “management approach” model for segment reporting the management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance the company determined it has one operating segment as of september     investment in real property tax liens – the investments in real property tax liens are accounted for as investments in troubled debt and are carried at cost collection of interest penalties and expense reimbursements is not certain and is recognized upon being realized the company has evaluated the collectability of the tax liens and believes the investments are realizable over time as the first position liens are secured by the related real property and the estimated fair value of the real property is in excess of the carrying value of the tax liens and the estimated cost to foreclose and sell the real property therefore no impairment was recognized on the tax liens as of september     income taxes   the company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of asc topic  “income taxes” the method of accounting for income taxes under asc  is an asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting bases of other assets and liabilities   emerging growth company   we are an “emerging growth company” as that term is used in the jumpstart our business startups act of  the “jobs act” and as such may elect to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements for future filings        recent accounting pronouncements   on june   the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  development stage entities topic  – elimination of certain financial reporting requirements including an amendment to variable interest entities guidance in topic  consolidation which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity dse in its entirety from current accounting guidance the company has elected early adoption of this new standard   the company has implemented all other new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   note    income taxes   deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and

to change         we expect to fund our budgeted  capital expenditures with cash flows from operations proceeds from additional potential noncore asset divestitures and borrowings under our senior credit agreement we strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position in the event our cash flows or proceeds from additional potential noncore asset dispositions are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms we may curtail our capital spending         our financial results depend upon many factors but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production the amount we realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices and our related commodity price hedging activities which are affected by changes in market demand and supply as impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors accordingly finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in an economical manner is critical to our longterm success

business financial condition cash flows and results of operations are not the only risks we face we may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or as a result of developments occurring in the future conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations risks related to the exchange offers and the new notes if you do not properly tender your old notes you will continue to hold unregistered outstanding notes and your ability to transfer outstanding notes will be adversely affected         we will only issue new notes in exchange for old notes that you timely and properly tender therefore you should allow sufficient time to ensure timely delivery of the old notes and you should carefully follow the instructions on how to tender your old notes neither we nor the exchange agent is required to tell you of any defects or irregularities with respect to your tender of old notes please read the exchange offersexchange offer procedures and description of the new notes         if you do not exchange your old notes for new notes in the exchange offer you will continue to be subject to the restrictions on transfer of your old notes described in the legend on the certificates for your old notes in general you may only offer or sell the old notes if they are registered under the securities act and applicable state securities laws or offered and sold under an exemption from these requirements we do not plan to register any sale of

or failure to exchange old notes you may find it difficult to sell your new notes         the new notes are a new issue of securities and although the new notes will be registered under the securities act the new notes will not be listed on any securities exchange because there is no public market for the new notes you may not be able to resell them         we cannot assure you that an active market will exist for the new notes or that any trading market that does develop will be liquid if an active market does not develop or is not maintained the market price and liquidity of our new notes may be adversely affected if a market for the new notes develops they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price the trading market for the new notes may be adversely affected by  changes in the overall market for noninvestment grade securities  changes in our financial performance or prospects  the financial performance or prospects for companies in our industry generally  the number of holders of the notes  the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes and  prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions  table of contents         historically the market for noninvestment grade debt has been subject to substantial volatility in prices the market for the new notes if any may be subject to similar volatility prospective investors in the new notes should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of such investment for an indefinite period of time some holders who exchange their old notes may be deemed to be underwriters         if you exchange your old notes in the exchange offers for the purpose of participating in a distribution of the new notes you may be deemed to have received restricted securities and if so will be required to comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the securities act in connection with any resale transaction risks related to our indebtedness and the notes we have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets and our ability to make payments on the notes is therefore dependent upon the performance of our subsidiaries         we are a holding company and our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our operating assets we have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries as a result our ability to make required payments on the notes depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by among other things any future indebtedness of our subsidiaries if we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to pay the principal amount at the maturity of the notes or to repurchase the notes upon an occurrence of a change of control we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as a refinancing of the notes we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes if we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness we may not be able to make payments on the notes         if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness including financial and operating covenants we could be in default under the terms of such agreements in the event of any such default  the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest  the lenders under our credit agreement could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder cease making further loans and commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets and  we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation         if we breach our covenants under our senior credit agreement or the indentures governing the notes and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders if this occurs we would be in default under our senior credit agreement or the indenture governing such notes the lenders could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations         our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the notes and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this to a certain extent is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry general economic and financial conditions the  table of contents impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors all of which are beyond our control         we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness we may have to undertake alternative financing plans such as  refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments such as remanufacturing our rigs and related equipment or  seeking to raise additional capital         however we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that implementing any such alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations in addition any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness including the notes would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms         our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations including our obligations under the notes or to obtain alternative financings could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects restrictive covenants in the indentures governing the notes and in our senior credit agreement could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations fund our capital needs respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests         the indentures governing the notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us these restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to among other things  pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  engage in mergers or consolidations or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  make certain dispositions and transfers of assets and  engage in transactions with affiliates         in addition our senior credit agreement contains a number of significant covenants that among other things restrict our ability to  dispose of assets  incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock  pay dividends on our capital stock  create liens on our assets  enter into sale or leaseback transactions  table of contents  enter into specified investments or acquisitions  repurchase redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt  merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries  engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates or  pursue other corporate activities         we may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing the notes and our senior credit agreement also our senior credit agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control and as a result we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests these financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings make needed capital expenditures withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities a decline in oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices or a prolonged period of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas prices at lower levels could result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial covenants under our senior credit agreement which could require us to refinance or amend the senior credit agreement resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us         a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our senior credit agreement a default under our senior credit agreement or the indentures governing the notes if not cured or waived could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder the accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable if that should occur we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing were then available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us moreover any new indebtedness we incur may impose financial restrictions and other covenants on us that may be more restrictive than the senior credit agreement or the indentures governing the notes see description of the new notes the notes and the guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness and that of our subsidiary guarantors         the notes and the guarantees will be general unsecured senior obligations ranking effectively junior in right of payment to any secured debt of ours and that of each subsidiary guarantor respectively including obligations under our senior credit agreement to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the debt at december   the borrowing base under our senior credit agreement was  million and we had no borrowings outstanding any amounts borrowed thereunder would be secured debt and effectively senior in right of payment to the notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness the indentures governing the notes will permit us and the subsidiary guarantors to incur additional secured debt in the future         if we or a subsidiary guarantor is declared bankrupt becomes insolvent or is liquidated or reorganized any secured debt of ours or that subsidiary guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from our assets or the assets of the guarantor as applicable securing that debt before any payment may be made with respect to the notes or the affected guarantees holders of the notes will participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that does not rank junior to the notes including the  senior unsecured convertible note due  held by halres llc and including all of our other general creditors and the holders of our secured debt to the extent such debt is not satisfied with the proceeds of the collateral therefor based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or  table of contents creditor in our remaining assets in any of the foregoing events we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes as a result holders of the notes would likely receive less ratably than holders of secured indebtedness our debt level in the future and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition results of operations and business prospects and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes         our level of indebtedness in the future and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt could have important consequences for our operations including by  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the notes or other indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other activities  limiting managements discretion in operating our business  limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  detracting from our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally  placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors and  making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates because debt under any senior revolving credit facility may vary with prevailing interest rates         we may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances if we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic and financial conditions we are able to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness         at december   our  billion senior credit agreement had a borrowing base of  million for secured borrowings subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations and we had no borrowings outstanding borrowings under the senior credit agreement are secured and as a result effectively senior to the notes and the guarantees of the notes by the guarantors to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness in addition the holders of our senior notes totaling  billion and the  unsecured convertible note due  which has a current principal balance of approximately  million along with holders of any future debt we may incur that ranks equally with the notes will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency liquidation reorganization dissolution or other windingup of us this may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you if new  table of contents debt is incurred the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify increased leverage could for example  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness if we fail to comply with the requirements of our indebtedness that failure could result in an event of default of such indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital capital expenditures and other business activities  limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  diminish our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally and  place us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors         if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels the related risks that we and they now face could increase we may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control         upon the occurrence of certain change of control events followed within  days by a lowering of the rating on the notes by either moodys investors service inc moodys or standard  poors ratings services sp we would be required to offer to repurchase all or any part of the notes then outstanding for cash at  of the principal amount the source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any change of control will be our available cash or cash generated from our operations or other sources including  sale of assets or  sales of equity         we cannot assure you that sufficient funds would be available at the time of any change of control to repurchase your notes additionally a change of control is an event of default under our senior credit agreement that would permit the lenders to accelerate the debt outstanding under such facility finally using available cash to fund the potential consequences of a change of control may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future which could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business operations a subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under united states bankruptcy or similar state law which would prevent the holders of the notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims         under united states bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws our subsidiary guarantees of the notes can be voided or claims under the subsidiary guarantees may be subordinated to all other debts of that subsidiary guarantor if among other things the subsidiary guarantor at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee or in some states when payments become due under the guarantee received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the guarantee and  was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence  table of contents  was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantors remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital or  intended to incur or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature         our subsidiary guarantees may also be voided without regard to the above factors if a court found that the subsidiary guarantor entered into the guarantee with the actual intent to hinder delay or defraud its creditors         a court would likely find that a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee if the subsidiary guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the guarantees if a court were to void a subsidiary guarantee you would no longer have a claim against the subsidiary guarantor sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources including the remaining subsidiary guarantors if any in addition the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from the subsidiary guarantor         the measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the governing law generally a guarantor would be considered insolvent if  the sum of its debts including contingent liabilities were greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets  the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts including contingent liabilities as they become absolute and mature or  it could not pay its debts as they become due         the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor will be limited as necessary to prevent each subsidiary guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law we cannot assure you that this limitation will protect the subsidiary guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or if it does that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would suffice if necessary to pay the notes in full when due the notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes         you would not have any claim as a creditor against any of our future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables whether secured or unsecured of those subsidiaries will be effectively senior to your claims against those subsidiaries as a result your ability to make a claim against those subsidiaries may be limited many of the covenants contained in the indenture will terminate if the notes are rated investment grade by both of sp and moodys         many of the covenants in the indentures governing the notes will terminate if the notes are rated investment grade by both of sp and moodys provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing these covenants will restrict among other things our ability to pay dividends to incur debt and to enter into certain other transactions there can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade or that if they are rated investment grade that the notes will maintain such ratings however termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force please see description of the new notescovenant

notes to require that the company repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover recapitalization or similar transaction         also the companys senior secured revolving credit facility currently treats certain change of control events with respect to the company as an event of default entitling the lenders to terminate all further lending commitments to accelerate all loans then outstanding and to exercise other remedies the occurrence of a change of control may result in a default under future indebtedness of the company and its subsidiaries and give the lenders thereunder the right to require the company to repay obligations outstanding thereunder moreover the exercise by holders of their right to require the company to repurchase the notes could cause a default under

transfer conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase substantially all there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law accordingly the ability of a holder of notes to require the company to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale lease transfer conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole may be uncertain in addition holders of notes may not be entitled to require the company to repurchase their notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of the board of directors of the company including in

between participants in dtc will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with dtc rules and will be settled in sameday funds transfers between participants in euroclear and clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures         we expect that dtc will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account dtc interests in a global note are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction however if there is an event of default under the notes dtc reserves the right to exchange the applicable global note for notes in certificated form certificated notes which it will distribute to its participants and which may be legended as set forth under the heading transfer restrictions         we understand that dtc is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the state of new york a banking organization within the meaning of new york banking law a member of the federal reserve system a clearing corporation within the meaning of the uniform commercial code and a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act dtc was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic bookentry changes in accounts of its participants thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates         although dtc euroclear and clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in a global note among participants of dtc euroclear and clearstream they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and such procedures may be discontinued at any time neither the company the guarantors the trustee nor any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by dtc euroclear or clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations exchange of global notes for certificated notes         a global note is exchangeable for certificated notes if  dtc a notifies the company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the global notes or b has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act and in either event the company fails to appoint a successor depositary within  days or  there has occurred and is continuing an event of default and dtc notifies the trustee of its decision to exchange the global notes for certificated notes         in all cases certificated notes delivered in exchange for any global note or beneficial interests in global notes will be registered in the names and issued in any approved denominations requested by or on behalf of dtc in accordance with its customary procedures and may bear the restrictive legend referred to in transfer restrictions  table of contents certain us federal income tax consequences         the following is a summary based on present law of the material united states federal income tax
