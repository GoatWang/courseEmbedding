vendettas bucoos jason christie series and kvds but the okuma tcs blows them all away for not a whole lot of money more the balance of these rods are great very light and very powerful grips and handle are very comfy too cant say enough good about them great job okuma and scott martin from unknown  comments i have never used okuma tackle but i am a fan of scott martin so i figured i would give these rods a shot  i got the  h about a month and a half ago and have been putting it through its paces ever since  i cant find a single thing i dont like about this rod  the balance is perfect and it is very light  this is now my go to rod  the designation on this rod is frogswimbait but i have done everything on this rod from throwing shaky heads to an arig  aside from throwing a dropshot i dont think there is anything i wouldnt use this rod for  the guides are perfect size they arent completely micro but they arent big buy any means  i saw a video where scott described them as medium micro guides  i have flipped  lb braid to a  lb fluro leader with an alberto knot without a single issue with the knot passing through the guides  i will definitely be getting more okuma tcs rods from dan pa  comments i got the  h and it is absolutely amazing its so light and ans so well balanced but the thing is is that its so weird how the  h is  to  lb test and the  is  to  lb test but whatever if you were ever going to get a flipping and pitching rod i highly recommend that you should get it from michael united states  comments i have the  foot  frogswimbait rod and it is an awesome rod scott mentions in one of his videos how it is a great all around rod and i could not agree more i use it for so many techniques from jigs swimbaits frogs chatterbaits just about anything if you dont wanna spend over  for a rod like myself this is a great rod for you from bill  comments the matt daddy tcs extra heavy is great for punching flipping  pitching   awesome but not for casting the action is superb but with the first offset eye casting distance over forty feet may result in a backlash awesome job on a rod for matt punching pitching  flipping but this rod must be made for casting enthusiast as well   the best rod action okuma has ever built  from william  thomaston ga  comments just purchased the  xheavy mat daddy and a  heavy i got to fish with them all weekend they both appear to be constructed well with no flaws in craftsmanship that i can find the following is my assessment of both rods separately heavy is as light as a loomis and every bit as fishable i threw a swim jig on it all weekend and never got a bite so i cant attest to the sensitivity but it feels like it is right where it should be very easy rod to handle it is not as heavy as some heavy rods i have used i dont know what has changed with rod makers in the last  years or so but when i used to look for medium heavy rods for certain applications now it requires me to find a heavy rod all things considered i am pleased with my purchase xheavy i have owned numerous high end flipping rods and i will say that this rod is the best out there for the price i have never fished a rod that can handle pitching heavy weights as smooth as this one does effortless it is super light and sensitive feels like a  rod in your hand because it is so well balanced and light plenty of strength too i am always skeptical of reviews that claim how light or sensitive a rod is i always have to see for myself because i have been led astray too many times and i have the receipts to prove it it blows away my fitzgerald  xheavy and is on par with my old kistler helium lta the biggest difference to me is this one is under  if you are looking for a flipping rod for heavy weights without having to spend a lot of  this is your rod from steve  central florida  comments i picked up the  frogswimbait rod  love it  caught a  pounder in some heavy grass on it on a keitech fat impact on a  hook on lb braid handled it no problem  bought another same exact rod from mike slidell la  comments i have a  h frog rod and a  m crankjerkbait rod both are just fantastic very well made the  m has a beautiful action and keeps fish on trebles buttoned up well i have abused the heck out of the  h frog rod even caught a  and an  lber on it and it handled them both beautifully the  even buried itself in the weeds the rod was about doubled over but it got the fish in with a nice side salad included the tip has a great action and it transitions smoothly to a very strong backbone i will never use a different frog rod from pat  comments flat out high end rod and feels like it the handle on the top grip flares out a little bit on the end making is so comfortable it just flat out works from tony ca  comments got the  ft  in flippingjig rod i mostly am pitching and not exactly flipping what was called once doodlesocking in some places so i need a rod where the upper  loads well enough with  oz bullet weights  jigs to help cast the lures the more rigid brutal rods make the casting more like launching the lures more like a high speed derricking i went through  or  different rods  configurations until i settled on this one the tcs flippingjig  had the optimum flex in the top  to pitch baits a good distance it is very light the ergonomics are quite good the upflared front grip feels great the small guides are not so small that they snag on the knot between my braid and the monofilament leader i have a   frog designated rod that prevents me from having much of a leader because the knot will snag if its inside the guides the micro guide is a fad and is stupid it creates problems  small guides are fine tiny clearance guides are asking for trouble with leaders the price was a bit above my  or so target but the extra  i spent didnt hurt me at all okuma has come from an unknown company some years ago to making great rods this is my nd okuma rod the other is a citrix spinning rod excellent happy with both  from jason pa  comments i recently purchased two of the mat daddy  heavy action rods for flipping the grass and buck brush here in east texas i find the rod to be a great value  very sensitive  light it has a good parabolic bend which helps keep the fish pinned one of my favorite things about the rod is the first eye being very near the reel seat this helps manage braid very well i wish i had gone with the extra heavy action instead of the heavy action it just doesnt seem to have quite the backbone i was looking for overall a great rod at a fair price  comments ive got  of these rods and they all have equally impressed me the  h mat daddy rod is a brute the  h flippingjig rod has very strong backbone and but a soft enough tip not to compromise sensitivity the  mh martin apc rod is perfect for all of your moving baits from swim jigs to crankbaits the  m jerkcrank rod has a very soft tip but enough backbone to control a  lb fish from daniel monroe la  comments these are super nice sticks i use the mh for buzz baits spinnerbaits chatter baits  skipping docks the h is a great frog rod in water willow or brush i use the h as an all purpose jig stick  a h for jungle warfare from t maddux trion ga  comments i purchased the  h flippinjig rod and i am very impressed the lightness of the rod is incredible and it has enough back bone to pull fish from heavy cover i am looking forward to purchasing the mat daddy from andreas chassell mi  comments  this rod is awesome i have the ft  heavy and i teamed it up with a lews  for manly top water i pulled in a  pounder along with  pounds of weeds using my frog this rod has a lot of back bone its an amazing rod i love it and will be buying a lot more of these rods especially for the price you cannot beat them great rods from joe id  comments love these rods i have  in rotation now and beat the living snot out of them with no issues problem is it  takes  purchases of the same model to find  that are consistant with the actions weight and balance points the guides sometimes come misaligned and crooked very poor quality control im glad i got them from tackle warehouse otherwise id be stuck with defective rods  get these in your hands before buying on line from steve nj  comments have used the  mh for about a year now and am very pleased  lure ratings are accurate and the mod fast action bends at probably  from tip  i use the rod for shallow and medium cranks and havent had an issue  the rod is easy on the eyes and reel seat is comfortable  the hook keeper is in a tricky spot at handle which may lead to trebles in hand  would probably be a good bladed jig and lipless crank rod too if i could ever put away squarebills from montanaro touchdown city wv  comments when people are going to buy this rod they need to take into consideration that most of the rod actions are moderate fast here that makes it feel softer than the usual fast and extra fast action hope this helps from stephen manchester ct  comments these are great rods that are often overlooked i purchased one just to try it out and then i purchased a few more afterward very light sensitive and comfortable cosmetics are awesome as well the action on these rods might be a bit softer that most people had already stated when in comparison to other brands but it handled the fishes just fine for me from chuong san jose ca  comments i purchased the  mh this rod is going to be my crank baitspinner bait rod i love the guides they are smaller than traditional but not as tiny as micro i agree with the review from kg the rod feels more like a medium action than mh this works for me tossing crank baits from cj canada comments i purchased the ft medium heavy as a rod to use for every day jig and worm fishing the first thing i noticed when i received the rod was how soft the action was definitely more of a medium bordering on ml action than a mh much softer than any mh rod ive ever used or felt the balance and sensitivity are nice but it does not have enough strength to handle jigs over oz this rod will make a very nice spinnerbait senko and crank bait rod but thats not what i bought it for my advice would be to get one of these in your hands before you buy it to make sure you get the proper action for its intended use i wish i had bought the heavy action from kg back to top shop by brand tackle warehouse
