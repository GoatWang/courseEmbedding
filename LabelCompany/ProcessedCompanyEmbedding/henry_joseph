selfinductance he also discovered mutual inductance independently of michael faraday – though faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device he invented a precursor to the electric doorbell specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire  and electric relay  the si unit of inductance the henry

scottish immigrants ann alexander henry and william henry his parents were poor and henrys father died while he was still young for the rest of his childhood henry lived with his grandmother in galway new york he attended a school which would later be named the joseph henry elementary school in his honor after school he worked at a general store and at the age of thirteen became an apprentice watchmaker and silversmith josephs first love was theater and he came close to becoming a professional actor his interest in science was sparked at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled popular lectures on experimental philosophy in  he entered the albany academy where he was given free tuition even with free tuition he was so poor that he had to support himself with teaching and private tutoring positions he intended to go into medicine but in  he was appointed an assistant engineer for the survey of the state road being constructed between the hudson river and lake erie from then on he was inspired to a career in either civil or mechanical engineering historical marker in academy park albany new york commemorating henrys work with electricity henry excelled at his studies so much so that he would often help his teachers teach science and in  was appointed professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at the albany academy by principal t romeyn beck some of his most important research was conducted in this new position his curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general he was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful electromagnet improving on william sturgeons electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire using this technique he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for yale he also showed that when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel but when using a setup with multiple batteries there should be only one single long coil the latter made the telegraph feasible because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit henry with discoveries predating faraday and hertz however henry is not credited due to not publishing his work joseph henry taken between  and  possibly by mathew brady using his newly developed electromagnetic principle henry in  created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion this was the earliest ancestor of modern dc motor it did not make use of rotating motion but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole rocking back and forth the rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells causing a polarity change and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery this apparatus allowed henry to recognize the property of self inductance british scientist michael faraday also recognized this property around the same time since faraday published his results first he became the officially recognized discoverer of the phenomenon in  henry worked in conjunction with professor stephen alexander to determine the relative temperatures for different parts of the solar disk they used a thermopile to determine that sunspots were cooler than the surrounding regions this work was shown to the astronomer angelo secchi who extended it but with some question as to whether henry was given proper credit for his earlier work in the fall of  history author jeremy tk farley released the civil war out my window diary of mary henry the page book featured the diary of henrys daughter mary from the years of  to  throughout the diary henry is repeatedly mentioned by his daughter who showed a keen affection to her father influences in aeronauticsedit prof henry was introduced to prof thaddeus lowe a balloonist from new hampshire who had taken interest in the phenomenon of lighterthanair gases and exploits into meteorology in particular the high winds which we call the jet stream today it was lowes intent to make a transatlantic crossing by utilizing an enormous gasinflated aerostat henry took a great interest in lowes endeavors promoting him among some of the more prominent scientists and institutions of the day in june  lowe had made a successful test flight with his gigantic balloon first named the city of new york and later renamed the great western flying from philadelphia to medford new york lowe would not be able to attempt a transatlantic flight until late spring of the  so henry convinced him to take his balloon to a point more west and fly the balloon back to the eastern seaboard an exercise that would keep his investors interested lowe took several smaller balloons to cincinnati ohio in march  on  april he launched on a fateful flight that landed him in confederate south carolina with the southern states seceding from the union during that winter and spring of  and the onset of civil war lowe abandoned further attempts at a transatlantic crossing and with henrys endorsement went to washington dc to offer his services as an aeronaut to the federal government henry submitted a letter to us secretary of war at the time simon cameron of pennsylvania which carried henrys endorsement hon simon cameron dear sir in accordance with your request made to me orally on the morning of the th of june i have examined the apparatus and witnessed the balloon experiments of mr lowe and have come to the following conclusions st the balloon prepared by mr lowe inflated with ordinary street gas will retain its charge for several days d in an inflated condition it can be towed by a few men along an ordinary road or over fields in ordinarily calm weather from the places where it is galled ie swelled or inflated to another twenty or more miles distant d it can be let up into the air by means of a rope in a calm day to a height sufficient to observe the country for twenty miles around and more according to the degree of clearness of the atmosphere the ascent may also be made at night and the camp lights of the enemy observed th from experiments made here for the first time it is conclusively proved that telegrams can be sent with ease and certainty between the balloon and the quarters of the commanding officer th i feel assured although i have not witnessed the experiment that when the surface wind is from the east as it was for several days last week an observer in the balloon can be made to float nearly to the enemys camp as it is now situated to the west of us or even to float over it and then return eastward by rising to a higher elevation this assumption is based on the fact that the upper strata of wind in this latitude is always flowing eastward mr lowe informs me and i do not doubt his statement that he will on any day which is favorable make an excursion of the kind above mentioned th from all the facts i have observed and the information i have gathered i am sure that important information may be obtained in regard to the topography of the country and to the position and movements of an enemy by means of the balloon now and that mr lowe is well qualified to render service in this way by the balloon now in his possession th the balloon which mr lowe now has in washington can only be inflated in a city where street gas is to be obtained if an exploration is required at a point too distant for the transportation of the inflated balloon an additional apparatus for the generation of hydrogen gas will be required the necessity of generating the gas renders the use of the balloon more expensive but this where important results are required is of comparatively small importance for these preliminary experiments as you may recollect a sum not to exceed  or  was to be appropriated and in accordance with this mr lowe has presented me with the in closed statement of items which i think are reasonable since nothing is charged for labor and time of the aeronautic i have the honor to remain very respectfully your obedient servant joseph henry secretary smithsonian institution on henrys recommendation lowe went on to form the united states armyunion army balloon corps and served two years with the army of the potomac as a civil war aeronaut later yearsedit henrys grave oak hill cemetery washington dc as a famous scientist and director of the smithsonian institution henry received visits from other scientists and inventors who sought his advice henry was patient kindly selfcontrolled and gently humorous one such visitor was alexander graham bell who on  march  carried a letter of introduction to henry henry showed an interest in seeing bells experimental apparatus and bell returned the following day after the demonstration bell mentioned his untested theory on how to transmit human speech electrically by means of a harp apparatus which would have several steel reeds tuned to different frequencies to cover the voice spectrum henry said bell had the germ of a great invention henry advised bell not to publish his ideas until he had perfected the invention when bell objected that he lacked the necessary knowledge henry firmly advised get it on  june  bells experimental telephone using a different design was demonstrated at the centennial exhibition in philadelphia where henry was one of the judges for electrical exhibits on  january  bell demonstrated his instruments to henry at the smithsonian institution and henry invited bell to demonstrate them again that night at the washington philosophical society henry praised the value and astonishing

inflated with ordinary street gas will retain its charge for several days d in an inflated condition it can be towed by a few men along an ordinary road or over fields in ordinarily calm weather from the places where it is galled ie swelled or inflated to another twenty or more miles distant d it can be let up into the air by means of a rope in a calm day to a height sufficient to observe the country for twenty miles around and more according to the degree of clearness of the atmosphere the ascent may also be made at night and the camp lights of the enemy observed th from experiments made here for the first time it is conclusively proved that telegrams can be sent with ease and certainty between the balloon and the quarters of the commanding officer th i feel assured although i have not witnessed the experiment that when the surface wind is from the east as it was for several days last week an observer in the balloon can be made to float nearly to the enemys camp as it is now situated to the west of us or even to float over it and then return eastward by rising to a higher elevation this assumption is based on the fact that the upper strata of wind in this latitude is always flowing eastward mr lowe informs me and i do not doubt his statement that he will on any day which is favorable make an excursion of the kind above mentioned th from all the facts i have observed and the information i have gathered i am sure that important information may be obtained in regard to the topography of the country and to the position and movements of an enemy by means of the balloon now and that mr lowe is well qualified to render service in this way by the balloon now in his possession th the balloon which mr lowe now has in washington can only be inflated in a city where street gas is to be obtained if an exploration is required at a point too distant for the transportation of the inflated balloon an additional apparatus for the generation of hydrogen gas will

smithsonian institution he was the secretary for the national institute for the promotion of science a precursor of the smithsonian institution he was highly regarded during his lifetime while building electromagnets henry discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of selfinductance he also discovered mutual inductance independently of michael faraday – though faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device he invented a precursor to the electric doorbell specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an electric wire  and electric relay  the si unit of inductance the henry is named in his honor henrys work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph

reading  external links biographyedit henry was born in albany new york to scottish immigrants ann alexander henry and william henry his parents were poor and henrys father died while he was still young for the rest of his childhood henry lived with his grandmother in galway new york he attended a school which would later be named the joseph henry elementary school in his honor after school he worked at a general store and at the age of thirteen became an apprentice watchmaker and silversmith josephs first love was theater and he came close to becoming a professional actor his interest in science was sparked at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled popular lectures on experimental philosophy in  he entered the albany academy where he was given free tuition even with free tuition he was so poor that he had to support himself with teaching and private tutoring positions he intended to go into medicine but in  he was appointed an assistant engineer for the survey of the state road being constructed between the hudson river and lake erie from then on he was inspired to a career in either civil or mechanical engineering historical marker in academy park albany new york commemorating henrys work with electricity henry excelled at his studies so much so that he would often help his teachers teach science and in  was appointed professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at the albany academy by principal t romeyn beck some of his most important research was conducted in this new position his curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general he was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful electromagnet improving on william sturgeons electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire using this technique he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for yale he also showed that when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel but when using a setup with multiple batteries there should be only one single long coil the latter made the telegraph feasible because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit henry with discoveries predating faraday and hertz however henry is not credited due to not publishing his work joseph henry taken between  and  possibly by mathew brady using his newly developed electromagnetic principle henry in  created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion this was the earliest ancestor of modern dc motor it did not make use of rotating motion but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole rocking back and forth the rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells causing a polarity change and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery this apparatus allowed henry to recognize the property of self inductance british scientist michael faraday also recognized this property around the same time since faraday published his results first he became the officially recognized discoverer of the phenomenon in  henry worked in conjunction with professor stephen alexander to determine the relative temperatures for different parts of the solar disk they used a thermopile to determine that sunspots were cooler than the surrounding regions this work was shown to the astronomer angelo secchi who extended it but with some question as to whether henry was given proper credit for his earlier work in the fall of  history author jeremy tk farley released the civil war out my window diary of mary henry the page book featured the diary of henrys daughter mary from the years of  to  throughout the diary henry is repeatedly mentioned by his daughter who showed a keen affection to her father influences in aeronauticsedit prof henry was introduced to prof thaddeus lowe a balloonist from new hampshire who had taken interest in the phenomenon of lighterthanair gases and exploits into meteorology in particular the high winds which we call the jet stream today it was lowes intent to make a transatlantic crossing by utilizing an enormous gasinflated aerostat henry took a great interest in lowes endeavors promoting him among some of the more prominent scientists and institutions of the day in june  lowe had made a successful test flight with his gigantic balloon first named the city of new york and later renamed the great western flying from philadelphia to medford new york lowe would not be able to attempt a transatlantic flight until late spring of the  so henry convinced him to take his balloon to a point more west and fly the balloon back to the eastern seaboard an exercise that would keep his investors interested lowe took several smaller balloons to cincinnati ohio in march  on  april he launched on a fateful flight that landed him in confederate south carolina with the southern states seceding from the union during that winter and spring of  and the onset of civil war lowe abandoned further attempts at a transatlantic crossing and with henrys endorsement went to washington dc to offer his services as an aeronaut to the federal government henry submitted a letter to us secretary of war at the time

science was sparked at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled popular lectures on experimental philosophy in  he entered the albany academy where he was given free

mathematics and natural philosophy at the albany academy by principal t romeyn beck some of his most important research was conducted in this new position his curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general he was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make a more powerful electromagnet improving on william sturgeons electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire using this technique he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for yale he also showed that when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel but when using a setup with multiple batteries there should be only one single long coil the latter made the telegraph feasible because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit henry with discoveries predating faraday and hertz however henry is not credited due to not publishing his work joseph henry taken between  and  possibly by mathew brady using his newly developed electromagnetic principle henry in  created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion this was the earliest ancestor of modern dc motor it did not make use of rotating motion but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole rocking back and forth the rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells causing a polarity change and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery this apparatus allowed henry to recognize the property of self inductance british scientist michael faraday also recognized this property around the same time since faraday published his results first

several days d in an inflated condition it can be towed by a few men along an ordinary road or over fields in ordinarily calm weather from the places where it is galled ie swelled or inflated to another twenty or more miles distant d it can be let up into the air by means of a rope in a calm day to a height sufficient to observe the country for twenty miles around and more according to the degree of clearness of the atmosphere the ascent may also be made at night and the camp lights of the enemy observed th from experiments made here for the first time it is conclusively proved that telegrams can be sent with ease and certainty between the balloon and the quarters of the commanding officer th i feel assured although i have not witnessed the experiment that when the surface wind is from the east as it was for several days last week an observer in the balloon can be made to float nearly to the enemys camp as it is now situated to the west of us or even to float over it and

required at a point too distant for the transportation of the inflated balloon an additional apparatus for the generation of hydrogen gas will be required the necessity of generating the gas renders the use of the balloon more expensive but this where important results are required is of comparatively small importance for these preliminary experiments as you may recollect a sum not to exceed  or

receives product suggestion on twitter tesla implements it  days later december   by henry joseph  grant elon musk didn’t end up starting diverse startups like paypal tesla and spacex by not being proactive and if tesla’s latest product update is any indication musk remains as entrepreneurial as ever in his role as tesla ceoon th december a twitter user sent elon musk this tweetelonmusk the san mateo supercharger is always full with idiots who leave their tesla for hours even if already charged— loic le meur loic december    loic le meur who’s an entrepreneur himself was complaining about the lack of available slots at tesla supercharger slots he said that users were using tesla’s superchargers as free parking spots leaving their cars on the chargers even after they were fully chargednow musk has  million twitter followers and receives thousands of such tweets per day but he immediately responded to this tweet saying he’ll “take action”loic youre right this is becoming an issue supercharger spots are meant for charging not parking will take action— elon musk elonmusk december   tesla was going to charge  for every minute a fully charged tesla would stand at its parking stations after a five minute grace period this simple change would ensure that people wouldn’t leave their cars at parking stations preventing others from using themand what’s incredible is the pace at which the product change was implemented tesla might still call itself a startup but it hardly is one – it has over  employees and large engineering teams to have a product feature conceptualised implemented and shipped in a week is nothing short of miraculousbut then musk also sends rockets into space so the normal rules don’t apply to him really  connect with and follow

faraday are the founding fathers of the electrical industry and electrical technology electric motors generators transformers radio and the telegraph all function on electromagnetic principles discovered by these men who worked on opposite sides of the atlantic henry not only pioneered electrical technology almost  years before thomas edison but led the smithsonian national academy of science and occupied important positions such as president lincolns science advisor the world of physics and electronics now uses the scientific unit henry h to measure inductance henry is the founding father of the national weather service and led study of the atmosphere contents  timeline of the electromagnet henrys most famous innovation  biography of joseph henry a early years b the birth of the electrical industry c henrys electric motor d henry and the telegraph e later years as a national leader and further study  related technologies  learn about the transformer and other modern devices that are based on henrys work  invention of the electromagnet timeline of major points s  alessandro volta italy experiments with chemistry to make electric sparks   volta develops the first battery based on luigi galvanis work and his own study voltas battery sets the stage for innovators like henry and davy later on using a relatively stable battery to supply current creates a flurry of discoveries  to   sir humphry davy makes the first electric light by inventing the arc lamp and incandescent light although neither are usable as products  electric light becomes the first innovation of electricity before the other major innovation of the electric motor later on   hans christian orsted discovered that electric currents create magnetic fields   william sturgeon was the first to take an varnished iron core and wrap it with bare copper wire when he energized it became magnetized for a moment then lost magnetism when the current escaped into the iron core he could not do a multilayered wrap which did not allow the magnet to be very strong   joseph henry discovers that it is necessary to use isolated wires copper wrapped in silk to make the wrap around the iron core this is very important and allows the magnet to hold a magnetic field the electromagnet has remained basically the same ever since s  henry builds many electromagnets of different sizes   joseph henry moves from albany academy to princeton nj princeton funds a trip to england where henry meets his contemporary michael faraday faradays work is based on moving a copper wire relative to a stationary magnet henrys work is based on using electricity to create a powerful electromagnet which induces current in a second electromagnet and electricity is than created on the other side this is the basis of a transformer below see our short video where dr frank wicks talks about the contributions of both henry and faraday and the meeting of the two in england in   min below about it   ironville new york joseph henry creates the first commercial electric product ever by working with allen penfield they create an ore separator henry created a powerful electromagnet that could lift  pounds  kilos that magnet would magnetize iron spikes that were fitted in a spinning drum those spikes combed through powdered iron ore the purest of iron stuck to the spikes and was brushed off into another bin this was the first commercial electrical product in history when vermont blacksmith thomas davenport visited this machine he was inspired and developed the first powerful electric motor in history just three years later   henry creates motion from electricity his first motors henry creates the oscillating beam motor and in another experiment is able to send power over  mile of wire to cause a striker to hit a bell at the albany academy   henry develops the intensity battery this helps make morses telegraph possible below our embedded video on the first magnetic ore separator the first electrical product or click link  biography joseph henry december    may   was an american scientist and engineer while building electromagnets he discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of selfinductance he also discovered mutual inductance independently of michael faraday but faraday was the first to publish his results his work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the electrical telegraph jointly invented by morse and wheatstone the si unit of inductance the henry is named after him a early years joseph henry was born on december th  in albany ny to two immigrants from scotland ann alexander henry and william henry his parents were poor and josephs father died while he was still a young boy so for the rest of his childhood joseph lived with his grandmother in galway ny he attended a school which would later be named joseph henry elementary school in his honor after school he worked at a general store and later at the age of thirteen he went to work as an apprentice watchmaker and silversmith josephs first love was theater and he came very close to becoming a professional actor his interest in science was piqued at the age of sixteen by a book of lectures on scientific topics titled popular lectures on experimental philosophy in  he was persuaded by some influential friends to pursue a more academic career he entered albany academy where he was given free tuition he was poor so even with free tuition joseph henry had to support himself with teaching and private tutoring positions initially he intended to go into the field of medicine but in  he was appointed an assistant engineer for the survey of state road being constructed between the hudson river and lake erie a distance of  miles from then on he was inspired to a career in engineering electromagnetism work at the albany academy joseph henry excelled at his studies so much so that he would often be helping his teachers teach science and by  he was appointed professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at the albany academy in albany new york some of henrys most important research was conducted in this new position josephs curiosity about terrestrial magnetism lead him to experiment with magnetism in general above photo of one of henrys earliest magnets attached what is probably a battery this photo was taken with ew rice jr holding it in the s right the bell and magnet here are from henrys  experiment where he was the first to send electricity over long distance  mile of wire which caused a striker to hit this bell this helped inspire the invention of the telegraph amusing fact henry used the term projectile power of a battery to describe the voltage of a battery he used this term because he wanted more power to be pushed through longer wires he wrapped longer and longer wires around his electromagnets and quickly ran into the problem of the weakness of batteries at the time henry was the first to tightly coil insulated wire around a ferrous core to make an extremely powerful electromagnet improving on william sturgeons electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire using this technique he built the most powerful electromagnet at the time for yale university the yale magnet he also showed that when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel but when using a set up with multiple batteries there should be only one single long coil used the latter made the telegraph feasible on may rd  henry marries harriet alexander b the birth of the electrical industry in the months of june and july of  henry builds an electromagnet for penfield and taft ironworks in ironville ny henry was already familiar with the mines in the area as he was seeking pure soft iron to work with in his experiments the device developed for ore separation see our timeline at the top of the page is the first commercial use of electricity in history see our page on henrys work at ironville ny  edison tech center videos the first commercial electrical device henrys ore separator  min iron in our electrical world  learn about irons role in electromagnetics how modern ore separators work  min the magnet above probably overheated and caused the damage blackened areas where the current was strong enough to go through the silk insulation later pioneers would explore and improve insulation and wire design left he built a frame and apparatus for lifting using the worlds most powerful electromagnet at the time it was demonstrated at the albany academy in albany new york c henrys electric motor joseph henry took what he had learned a step further and in  created one of the first machines to use electromagnetism for motion this was the one of the earliest ancestors of the modern dc motor it didnt make use of rotating motion but was merely an electromagnet perched on a pole rocking back and forth the rocking motion was caused by on of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells causing a polarity change and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery henrys work on motors allowed thomas davenport to invent the first real electric motor in  davenport used his motor to operated a small model car and train this helped lead to street cars developed by frank sprague and the electric car joseph henrys oscillating beam motor photo from the smithsonian d henry and the telegraph one year after henrys oscillating beam motor and mile transmission of power to ring a bell samuel f b morse took the idea further and conceived the idea for the telegraph  morse alfred vail and leonard gale used henrys intensity batteries in  to do important experiments sending power over long wires after much improvements the telegraph became the first wide scale commercial use of electricity s in the s the technology produced significant profit for shareholders while henry was one of the key inventors of the telegraph he was an academic man and did not profit to the extent that morse and others did henry did benefit in being respected as the most important scientist in north america at the time and gained power and position in washington in the end of our video with electrical pioneers elihu thomson and ew rice they acknowledge the great importance of joseph henry to the electrical industry in  thomson mentions that his early inspiration to be an engineer in electricity came when he recreated some simple rocking devices similar to henrys oscillating beam motor the yale magnet photo by the smithsonian henry discovers electromagnetic induction in july  henry publishes results in the sillimans american journal of science on his work with selfinduction he had conducted experiments with his electromagnets and sparks measured the results using a galvanometer henry creates an important foundation in physics knowledge and creates a first understanding of the principle that drives transformers and generators learn about the concept of induction on our page here e henry secures his future as a leader by the s henry had secured himself as an important figure in the united states engineeringscientific community he was voted to be the first secretary of the smithsonian on december   henry restructured the young organization and crafted goals and organizationalfinancial structure for the smithsonian he continued to work with the smithsonian for the next  years in  he formally launched his program to study atmospheric and weather patterns in north america henrys program involved over  volunteers from the caribbean to canada his work led to the creation of the national weather service later in  henrys innovations in the telegraph actually are what helped make weather data efficient to gather in real time henry led many scientific societies and encouraged young people to pursue the sciences he became the second president of the national academy of sciences nas henry pushed for international cooperation in science and engineering he worked hard in efforts to have the smithsonian share information with other european institutions during the american civil war  henry became lincolns science advisor he worked in developing ways to conserve resources for the war effort the smithsonian became involved with the surgeongeneral in
