first sustained attempt to read the gospel of mark both as an ancient biography and as a form of ancient rhetoric ben witherington applies to mark the sociorhetorical approach for which he is well known opening a fresh new perspective on the earliest gospel written when the fledging christian faith was experiencing a major crisis during the jewish war mark provides us with the first window on how the life and teachings of jesus were presented to a largely nonjewish audience according to witherington the structure of mark demonstrates that this gospel is biographically focused on the identity of jesus and the importance of knowing who he isthe christ the son of god this finding reveals that christology stood at the heart of the earliest christians faith it also shows how important it was to these earliest christians to persuade others about the nature of jesus both as a historical figure and as the savior of the world author bio▼▲ ben witherington iii is amos professor of new

stars out of  may   buddy boone witherington has written several of the sociorhetorical commentaries for eerdmans this one on marks gospel is just tremendous dr witherington sets the paradigm for interpreting mark by identifying it as an ancient biography in which the writer utilizes ancient rhetoric witherington sees mark writing to a largely nonjewish audience and this obviously impacts the

of  contemplativereflections  stars out of  book review god is june   contemplativereflections quality  value  meets expectations  in god is mark jones surveys the various communicable and incommunicable attributes of god through a devotional perspective jones emphasizes that when studying gods attributes we must consider all these characteristics collectively as revealed through the bible moreover it is incorrect to consider one attribute as being more important than another as all of gods attributes are equally essential and necessary another point that the author asserts is that jesus as god incarnate possessing both divine and human natures displays gods character in a tangible way to us thus we can draw numerous implications on how we should live by imitating christ who is the only human which reflected gods image perfectly in each chapter jones discusses on one attribute using a threefold approach that examines how the doctrine of the attribute is found in scripture how the attribute is found in christ as the godman and how the attribute applies to the christian life the author is careful to explain each attribute in the simplest terms backed by evidence from the bible and observations from historical sources such as augustine and the westminster confession of faith furthermore jones skillfully draws out many helpful applications that most readers may not have realized when considering gods attributes in the past i would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an accessible resource in learning about who god is and how he interacts with his creatures especially through his son jones laments that there has been a steady decline in the attention given to gods attributes in both public and private worship i would further add that christians need to go beyond just believing that god exists we need to increase our understanding and appreciation of gods attributes so that we can live faithfully and grow spiritually when we consider gods majesty glory and sovereignty the temporary discomforts and suffering we face becomes much more bearable when we face temptations and difficulties we can find comfort that our immutable omniscient and omnipotent god will give us strength to carry on when we fall into sin we can rest assured that our merciful loving and patient god will not give up on his children when we advance in our knowledge of who god is we will indelibly grow in our faith obedience and love for the triune god in compliance with federal trade commission regulations i was provided a review copy of

commentary on scripture does what very few of todays students of the bible could do for themselves with the aid of computer technology the vast array of writings from the church fathers—including much that is available only in the ancient languages—have been combed for their comment on scripture from these results scholars with a deep knowledge of the fathers and a heart for the church have hand selected material for each volume shaping annotating and introducing it to todays readers each portion of commentary has been chosen for its salient insight its rhetorical power and its faithful representation of the consensual exegesis of the early church about this volume the ancient christian commentary mark covers the gospel of mark and can also be purchased as part of a moneysaving bundle the early church valued the gospel of mark for its preservation of the apostolic voice and gospel narrative of peter yet the early church fathers very rarely produced sustained commentary on mark this briskpaced and robust little gospel so much enjoyed by modern readers was overshadowed in the minds of the fathers by the magisterial gospels of matthew and john but now with the assistance of computer searches an abundance of comment has been discovered to be embedded and interleaved amidst the textual archives of patristic homilies apologies letters commentaries theological treatises and hymnic verses in this ancient christian commentary on mark the insights of augustine of hippo and clement of alexandria ephrem the syrian and cyril of jerusalem join in a polyphony of interpretive voices of the eastern and western church from the second century to the seventh st marks gospel displays the evocative power of its story parables and passion as it ignites a brilliant exhibit of theological insight and pastoral wisdom the ancient christian commentary on mark now in its second edition opens up a longforgotten passage through the arid and precipitous slopes of postenlightenment critical interpretation and bears us along to a fertile valley basking in the sunshine of theological and spiritual interpretation in these pages we enter the interpretive world that long nurtured the

qty name price our history history of it works it will change your life it works® started in  and is now debtfree and expanding all over the world but no matter how big we grow well always do things at it works our way the it works way  from humble beginnings it works was born out of mark  cindy pentecost’s passion to offer families like yours the opportunity to dream big to begin living life in your own terms—because they too had those dreams once themselves long before the founding of it works global mark was a high school teacher and basketball coach in the small town of allegan michigan cindy was a stayathome mom with their three children a job of the utmost importance that the family took great pride in her doing  they were rich in love and filled with dreams but struggling to make ends meet financially so mark  cindy devised a plan an extra  a month to be earned through a homebased business opportunity in the telecommunications industry after months of evening hours dedicated to their new side business the pentecosts’ earnings grew far beyond the goal they had originally set after a few years mark became a topten earner in the company bought the family’s freedom and began to dream of the next big challenge helping other families do the same  they weren’t sure how they would do it yet but the seed had been planted for it works global  the ultimate body applicator the biggest challenge in this industry—and really the worldwide market—is to offer an uncommon solution a true original that captivates people and offers them something they never thought possible before  when we found the ultimate body applicator we knew we had something special to share with the world”  mark pentecost ceo it works global to this day it works’ first product is still its most popular the ultimate body applicator  the sitespecific body contouring treatment has been in the hands of celebrities at hollywood events and at the doorsteps of people like you all over the world—exclusively available through it works global it all started when mark pentecost received a call from pam sowder now it works chief networking officer raving about a product that was an alternative to the growing trend for more drastic measures like cosmetic surgeries or constricting shapewear when the pentecosts traveled to try this seemingly unbelievable product mark recalls “i watched my wife try it she was ecstatic with the results and i watched her call her girlfriend right away to tell her what had happened  her girlfriend said that she wanted to try it and they hung up  it wasnt  seconds later her girlfriend called back and said ‘my daughter was listening and she wants one for her chin is there something for the chin that was when i knew that we had a perfect product for direct selling a product that people would be excited to share with their friends and family since then the ultimate body applicator has become a global phenomenon and pam sowder now travels all over the world to meet with distributors give handson training and support and share the ultimate body applicator  the mind behind the magic a product so special as the ultimate body applicator could only come from a mind that is both brilliant and passionate about the use of safe natural ingredients luis mijares  luis the formulator behind the it works body contouring and skin care products has been a friend and business partner to mark pentecost since their first introduction in  luis passion for research and development in the skin care nutritional pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries began when he was a child learning natural remedies from his grandmother in mexico  his abundant credentials including his experience as the ceo of a top pharmaceutical company his international reknown as an herbalist and university educator of phytotherapy the uses of plants for medicinal purposes along with his keen personal interest in natural solutions made luis the ideal candidate for the it works product development specialist  the it works premium supplements line the it works premium supplements line began when mark made a routine visit to his doctor’s office several years ago on this visit mark’s doctor instructed him to start taking a daily multivitamin supplement but when mark asked his doctor which one he should take he was taken aback by the physician’s response “i don’t know but i wouldn’t take a cheap one you only live once  i didnt know what to do with that recalls mark you want to know that youre putting the very best things in your body so i began the long and hard search for the best multivitamin on the market mark took a trip to a local nutrition store looking for answers sales people swarmed after him vitamins filled the shelves all claiming different benefits over an hour later mark left feeling more confused than when he had gone in overwhelmed with options next he began asking his friends which vitamins they were taking some made their choices because the vitamin had a nice package others simply looked for a midpriced vitamin unsure of what exactly they were putting in their bodies and others picked up the most expensive item hoping that it was in fact the very best for them  the more i got into the education of a vitamin i started learning more about whats all natural versus synthetic says mark a lot of times youd find that a product might have  ingredients but there wasnt enough of each ingredient for the product to actually do what the clinicals showed they could do you want something foundational that you know has the key ingredients to help keep us healthy and be the best we can be eventually marks search brought him to meet don verhulst md a doctor with an extensive background in researching the effects of nutrition and natural remedies on todays common health issues mark and dr don worked together to kick off the it works premium dietary supplements line with its vital an advanced formula multivitamin mineral and enzyme
