some dinosaurs were endothermic warmblooded along with his mentor john ostrom bakker was responsible for initiating the ongoing dinosaur renaissance in paleontological studies beginning with bakkers

 work the dinosaur heresies bakker puts forth the theory that dinosaurs were warmblooded his evidence for this includes almost all animals that walk upright today are warmblooded and dinosaurs walked upright the hearts of warmblooded animals can pump much more effectively than the hearts of coldblooded animals therefore the giant brachiosaurus must have had the type of heart associated with warmblooded animals in order to pump blood all the way up to its head dinosaurs such as deinonychus led a very active life which was much more compatible with a warmblooded animal some dinosaurs lived in northern latitudes where it would have been impossible for coldblooded dinosaurs to keep warm the rapid rate of speciation and evolution found in dinosaurs is typical of warm blooded animals and atypical of cold blooded animals the predatorprey ratio of predatory dinosaurs to their prey is a signature trait of warmblooded predators rather than coldblooded ones birds are warmblooded birds evolved from dinosaurs therefore a change to a warmblooded metabolism must have taken place at some point there is far more change between dinosaurs and their ancestors the archosaurs than between dinosaurs and birds warmblooded metabolisms are evolutionary advantages for top predators and large herbivores if the dinosaurs had not been warmblooded there should be fossil evidence showing mammals evolving to fill these ecological niches no such evidence exists in fact mammals by the end of the cretaceous had become smaller and smaller from their mammallikereptile ancestors dinosaurs grew
