objectives risks charges and expenses before investing you can obtain the prospectus and summary prospectus with this and other information about the fund from the versus capital web site versuscapitalcom read them carefully before investing an investment in the fund is subject to a high degree of risk the fund does not intend to list its shares on any securities exchange during the offering period and a secondary market in the shares is not expected to develop there is no guarantee that shareholders will be able to sell all of their tendered shares during a quarterly repurchase offer an investment is not suitable for investors that require liquidity other through the fund’s repurchase policy you should not expect to be able to sell your shares other than through the fund’s repurchase policy regardless of how the fund performs real estate is subject to special risks among which are tenant default environmental problems and adverse changes in local economic conditions the yield from an underlying investment fund could be significantly reduced if it fails to qualify as a reit real estate investment trust for tax purposes the funds investments also may be negatively affected by the broad investment environment although the fund is intended to provide a means by which investors can diversify their portfolios into real estate the fund itself is nondiversified under the investment company act of  since changes in the market value of a single holding may cause a greater fluctuation in the funds net asset value than in a diversified fund the fund is not intended to be a complete investment program investors are reminded that portfolio diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss a multimanager strategy involves certain risks for example the success of the fund depends in large part upon the ability of the adviser to choose successful investment managers it is possible that some investment managers may take similar market positions thereby interfering with the funds investment goal the fund and underlying investment managers may borrow as an investment strategy the fund intends to limit borrowing to one third of its gross asset value while borrowing presents opportunities to increase the funds total return it potentially increases the losses as well under certain circumstances the funds distribution policy could result in a return of capital potentially causing the funds expense ratio to increase the adviser subadviser and investment mangers manage portfolios for themselves and for clients other than the fund a conflict between the interests of the fund and the interests of these other parties may arise in certain situations which potentially could disadvantage the fund for example a suitable but limited investment opportunity might be allocated to another client rather than to the fund contacts adviserversus capital advisors llcjohn loomis infoversuscapitalcomordistributorforeside funds distributors llc
