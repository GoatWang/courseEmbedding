midstream the midstream natural gas industry is the link between the exploration and production of natural gas and the delivery of its components to enduse markets the midstream industry consists of natural gas gathering compression treating processing storage and transportation and is generally characterized by regional competition based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing plants to natural gas producing wells and the proximity of storage facilities to production areas and enduse markets through our midstream segment we own and operate approximately  miles of in service natural gas  natural gas processing plants  natural gas treating facilities and  natural gas conditioning facilities with an aggregate processing treating and conditioning capacity of approximately  bcfd our midstream segment focuses on the gathering compression treating blending and processing and our operations are currently concentrated in major producing basins and shales including the austin chalk trend and eagle ford shale in south and southeast texas the permian basin in west texas and new mexico the barnett shale and woodford shale in north texas the bossier sands in east texas the marcellus shale in west virginia and pennsylvania and the haynesville shale in east texas and louisiana many of our midstream assets are integrated with our intrastate transportation and storage assets our midstream segment also includes a  interest in elg which operates natural gas gathering oil pipeline and oil stabilization facilities in south texas a  membership interest in ranch westex jv llc which processes natural gas delivered from the nglsrich shale formations in west texas a  membership interest in ors which operates a natural gas gathering system in the utica shale in ohio and a  interest in mi vida jv which operates a cryogenic processing plant and related facilities in west texas a  membership interest in aqua – pvr which transports and supplies fresh water to natural gas producers in the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and a  interest in sweeny gathering lp which operates a natural gas gathering facility in south texas our midstream segment results are derived primarily from margins we earn for natural gas volumes that are gathered transported purchased and sold through our pipeline systems and the natural gas and ngl volumes processed at our processing and treating facilities the following details our assets in the midstream segment   southeast texas system  approximately  miles of natural gas pipeline  one natural gas processing plant la grange with aggregate capacity of  mmcfd   natural gas treating facilities with aggregate capacity of  bcfd  one natural gas conditioning facility with aggregate capacity of  mmcfd the southeast texas system is

thirteen counties between austin and houston this system is connected to the katy hub through the east texas pipeline and is connected to the oasis pipeline as well as two power plants this allows us to bypass our processing plants and treating facilities when processing margins are unfavorable by blending untreated natural gas from the southeast texas system with natural gas on the oasis pipeline while continuing to meet pipeline quality specifications the la grange processing plant is a natural gas processing plant that processes the rich natural gas that flows through our system to produce residue gas and ngls residue gas is delivered into our intrastate pipelines and ngls are delivered into our ngl pipelines and then to lone star our treating facilities remove carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from natural gas gathered into our system before the natural gas is introduced to transportation pipelines to ensure that the gas meets pipeline quality specifications in addition our conditioning facilities remove heavy hydrocarbons from the gas gathered into our systems so the gas can be redelivered and meet downstream pipeline hydrocarbon dew point specifications   north texas

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
