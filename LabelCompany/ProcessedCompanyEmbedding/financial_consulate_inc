employees aum portfolio values historical f current portfolio holdings new positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions rd qtr  rd qtr  nd qtr  st qtr  hedge funds b b b b funds of funds b b b b sectors convertible

universe a different class of investment are managed futures   commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because

created a methodology termed triune planning® at the consulate the core of every successful financial plan is life planning—the values and goals that drive your decisions in life without being based on this foundation financial planning recommendations not aligned with your values and goals stand little chance of being realized or worse yet may force you to alter your values and goals once your plan for life has been clearly articulated the financial planning process—spanning net worth cash flow insurance education tax investment retirement and estate planning and their many derivatives—flows naturally because the subject matter is so deep and wide the application of comprehensive financial planning recommendations may take months or even years to properly implement information planning therefore is the necessary and perpetual third step to ensure the proper information is maintained and available for retrieval     redefining wealth our mission is to help

philosophy methodology team history staff locations gettysburg hunt valley seminars email sign up homeabout philosophy the financial consulate™ is redefining wealth money riches  wealth is more than the name of our educational radio show there is a greater meaning behind those words if you trace the meaning of the words money riches and wealth you’ll find that money and riches meant something quite similar to what they imply today—money and riches however while the word wealth seems in our generation to have become synonymous with an abundance of money and riches its original derivation was closer to a word with far deeper meaning—contentment the financial consulate is redefining wealth reclaiming it from the institutionally guarded perception of a centuriesold financial industry which leads us to believe that if we only follow it we’ll have money riches and wealth… and all of our dreams will come true we know that fulfillment in life is not derived from the mere accumulation of currency and investments but from true wealth—contentment—and lifestyles portfolios and net worth statements of differing shapes and sizes these concepts have become the foundation for this company and the manner and method with which we plan advise protect and invest for over  years we have partnered with individuals families and companies to bring clarity in the form of personalized comprehensive financial planning services following our financial physical® method additionally our personal financial management includes ongoing financial planning advice as well as discretionary asset management in our proprietary investment management style known as riskopportunity investing without trust there can be no relationship therefore we do everything we can to ensure trust is established and maintained we are one of a relatively small number of advisory firms worldwide that are part of the national association of personal financial advisors napfa our active membership and participation in napfa requires that we act as a true fiduciary at all times maintain the highest level of continuing education required in the financial planning discipline and never accept commissions feeonly for the sale of products or referral fees for the referral of business finally trust cannot be maintained in the presence of manipulation or confinement hence our motto “free to come free to go” many who’ve dealt with the financial industry have been given the “red carpet treatment” to become clients but then found they suffered various forms of penalties if they chose to leave surrender charges account closing fees and armtwisting guilt trips are all too common our pledge is that we will bless you coming or going if you choose to leave us for any reason you will not face any surrender charges or account closing fees and we will work diligently to help you move trust is best preserved in an atwill engagement pt barnum said “money is a terrible master but an excellent servant” we at the financial consulate believe that money in and of itself is not powerful money is simply a neutral tool to enhance relationships which is the essence of true wealth now that is powerful redefining wealth our mission is to help ourclients lessen the worryand burden of moneymanagement so theyhave more time to spendbuilding relationships services financial physicalreg
