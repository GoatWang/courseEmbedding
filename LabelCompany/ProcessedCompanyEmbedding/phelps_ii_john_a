his height of  feet  inches  cm—and act as long propulsive paddles his relatively short legs lower drag and perhaps add the speed enhancement of a hydrofoil his size feet provide the effect of flippers and his hypermobile ankles can extend beyond the pointe of a ballet dancer enabling him to whip his feet as if they were fins for maximum thrust through the water testing for
