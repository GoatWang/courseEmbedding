on april  waveland resource partners iv lp investment losses have you suffered investment losses in waveland resource partners iv lp if so the white law group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a finra dispute resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment according to their website waveland invests in oil and gas exploration and development throughout the midcontinent and permian basin regions of the united states alongside many of the largest and most active exploration and production companies waveland often raises money for investments through reg d private placement offerings like the company did for waveland resource partners iv lp  these reg d private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission usually between  as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from  the trouble with alternative investment products the trouble with alternative investment products like waveland resource partners iv lp is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds  an additional risk inherent to mewbourne oil offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities the white law group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like waveland resource partners iv lp broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment recommendation that is made is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age risk tolerance net worth financial needs and investment experience risks with reg d private placements however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks for example waveland’s own website has this to say “private placements investments involve a high degree of risk and should be undertaken only by persons who have the sophistication and financial resources to assume these risks” fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a finra arbitration claim recovery of investment losses to determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred
