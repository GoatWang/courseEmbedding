highend core routers mostly at the expense of cisco systems sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share of the market but other companies such as lucent alcatel and startups avici systems and pluris had announced plans to release products that would outpace junipers routers juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with cisco junipers edge routers had a  market share two months after release both companies made exaggerated marketing claims juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make it staff bored and cisco announced lab tests from light reading proved its products were superior to juniper whereas

major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere in  by  both cisco and juniper had increased their focus on edge routers because many isps had built up abundant bandwidth at the core several improvements to junipers software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late  at this time juniper had the largest marketshare  of the broadband aggregation market in  juniper entered the market for cablemodem termination systems with the gseries product family after the acquisition of pacific broadband the product family was discontinued later that year junipers first enterprise switch product was the ex  which was released in  in a

another network architecture called metafabric and a new set of switches the qfx family as one of the foundations of the new architecture in february  several software and hardware improvements were introduced for juniper routers including a series of software applications isps could use to provide internetbased services to consumers in december  juniper introduced a network switch ocx that could run on either the junos operating system or the open compute project opensource software securityedit juniper networks srx service gateway and security appliance juniper networks introduced the jprotect security toolkit in may  it included firewalls flow monitoring filtering and network address translation nat through the  acquisition of netscreen technologies juniper acquired the juniper secure meeting product line as well as remote desktop access software the netscreengt adsl security appliance was the first new netscreen product juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first

software for its nac capabilities for switches according to a  review in network world junipers ssg  firewall and routing product was the first serious threat to competing products from cisco juniper

several products for intrusion deception which create fake files store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter marked in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking

sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share of the market but other companies such as lucent alcatel and startups avici systems and pluris had announced plans to release products that would outpace junipers routers juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with cisco junipers edge routers had a  market share two months after release both companies made exaggerated marketing claims juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make it staff bored and cisco announced lab tests from light reading proved its products were superior to juniper whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion by  both

routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere in  by  both cisco and juniper had increased their focus on edge routers because many isps had built up abundant bandwidth at the core several improvements to junipers software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late  at

the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt

position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected

routers juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with cisco junipers edge routers had a  market share two months after release both companies made exaggerated marketing claims juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make it staff bored and cisco announced lab tests from light reading proved its products were superior to juniper whereas

major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere in  by  both

in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking

by pradeep sindhu on ‎  am since founding juniper networks  years ago i’ve worked tirelessly with juniper engineers to deliver on our commitment to invest in and incubate disruptive innovation   today i’m pleased to share that juniper networks has entered into an agreement to acquire aurrion a disruptive innovator in siliconphotonics technology if you’re not familiar with siliconphotonics consider this   over the past almost two decades juniper has dramatically reduced the cost per bitpersecond of the electronics portion of networking systems unfortunately the optoelectronics portion—the one that converts electricity to light and viceversa—has not followed a similar cost curve   historically the optoelectronic portion represented significantly less than half the cost of a networking system especially for optoelectronics designed for short to medium distances if we fast forward to today we see that things have completely reversed the optoelectronics portion now represents significantly more than half the cost   and here’s the real problem—the explosive growth of video streaming social networking and other bandwidth intensive applications such as data center to data center traffic means that there is no letup in the hunger for greater bandwidth at ever decreasing cost and ever increasing flexibility   something has to change   introducing aurrion aurrion has invented breakthrough technology that combines the economies of scale pioneered by the silicon industry with the unique properties of light to carry information over long distances at significantly lower cost the end result dramatically lower cost per bitpersecond for networking systems higher capacities for networking interfaces and greater flexibility in how bandwidth carried on light is processed inside the electronic portions of networking systems   why juniper and aurrion as the world moves rapidly to the cloud juniper will continue to be a leader in the industry in developing the network infrastructure that powers this transformation we expect that aurrion’s breakthrough technology will result in fundamental and permanent improvements in cost per bitpersecond power per bitpersecond bandwidth density and flexibility of networking systems if we couple this new technology with juniper’s history of bringing innovative networking products to market we believe we can make significant improvements to the foundations of all of our networking products within a relatively short time   simply put we believe this acquisition will strengthen juniper’s ability to bring the most advanced and most cost effective network products to market more quickly   please join me in welcoming aurrion to the juniper community we look forward to sharing more with you as we continue to combine our strengths for the benefit of our customers and our industry   forwardlooking statements statements in this blog concerning juniper networks business strategy and focus market demand the results and improvements made possible by aurrion’s technology including as combined with juniper networks solutions the impact of the acquisition on our ability to bring the most advanced and cost effective network products to market and our overall future prospects are forwardlooking statements that involve a number of uncertainties and risks actual results or events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forwardlooking statements as a result of several factors including our ability to close the contemplated acquisition and integrate the acquired company and its technology and other factors listed in our most recent report on form k and subsequent quarterly reports on form q filed with the securities and exchange commission all statements made in this blog

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt

common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is
