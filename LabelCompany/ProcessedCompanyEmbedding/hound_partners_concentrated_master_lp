fund analysishedge fundsnews jonathan auerbach cofounded longshort equity fund hound partners with scott mclellan in  seeded by tiger management jonathan auerbach had been a senior analyst at ziff brothers investments before joining tiger management in  when he was put in charge of a new umbrella fund which later became hound partners auerbach lured scott mclellan to tiger to help him run the fund prior to that mclellan worked at highbridge capital in  scott mclellan left to form marble arch partners with timothy jenkins who had spent three years working at tiger management jonathan auerbach’s hound partners gained around  percent in  marble arch investments was founded in  by scott mclellan who had previously worked at hound partners hound’s manager jonathan auerbach is a tiger cub and so mclellan can trace his investment lineage to julian robertson as well mclellan himself worked at highbridge capital management and has an mba from northwestern marble arch is a longshort equity fund in their most recent f filings reflecting activity during the fourth quarter of  two hedge funds hound partners and marble arch investments showed a remarkable amount of similarity in their holdings and investment activity including valeant pharmaceuticals international inc nysevrx carters inc nysecri fleetcor technologies inc nyseflt and w r grace  co nysegra other equities owned by both funds include charter communications inc nasdaqchtr and american international group inc nyseaig given the concentrated number of stocks in their portfolios  for hound and  for marble arch we thought it would be interesting in delve into their common investments a little deeper given the backgrounds of the founders of the two firms it is not surprising that their investments should overlap both jonathan auerbach and scott mclellan who founded hound partners worked at tiger management previously three years later mclellan left hound to setup another hedge fund marble arch along with timothy jenkins another tiger management alumni both funds based in new york ny employ a longshort equity strategy based on fundamental analysis valeant pharmaceuticals international inc nysevrx was the top holding of both funds as of yearend  accounting for  of hound’s equity portfolio and  of marble arch’s neither fund changed its holdings of the multinational specialty pharmaceutical company during the fourth quarter vrx has had a strong run over the past year as its earnings have been boosted by its recent acquisition of eye care products maker bausch  lomb holdings inc fleetcor technologies inc nyseflt was another top holding of both funds which was the third largest holding of hound and second largest of marble arch both funds did reduce their positions by  in the payment processor of commercial fuel cards during the quarter but their large remaining stakes still imply a bullish view on the stock chemical and materials manufacturer w r grace  co nysegra occupied the fourth largest position in hound’s portfolio and third largest in marble arch’s again we see a similarity in investing behavior among the two funds as both reduced their stakes in the company by  during the fourth quarter but still maintained relatively large stakes this could reflect a directional bet on gra exiting bankruptcy soon charter communications inc nasdaqchtr was the fifth largest equity investment of hound and eighth largest  of marble arch both funds increased their positions in the telecommunications company by  during the quarter the stock could have been a bet that chtr would outbid comcast corp nasdaqcmcsa and successfully acquire time warner cable nysetwc although cmcsa and twc reached an agreement recently chtr’s largest shareholder liberty media corp nasdaqlmca

partners august   by stan altshuller share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday marble arch investments faryan amirghassemi director of analytics every monday novus digs into the public holdings of a prominent hedge fund manager this week we take a look at marble arch investments marble arch is a prime example of the wildly successful lineage of julian robertson’s tiger management its founder scott mclellan worked at hound partners whose founder jonathan auerbach worked at tiger this “family tree” of hedge funds has produced prolific and successful longshort equity managers and marble arch investments is no exception what is particularly interesting to study is the “family resemblance” in investment style and underlying holdings for these managers about our data everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance marble arch investments and hound partners while we’ve talked extensively about the similarity in portfolio structure between tiger lineage managers many have noted the tremendous overlap between hound and its sibling marble arch as of the most recent f filings  of marble arch’s portfolio is owned by hound while that sounds a lot prior quarters have been nearly  both managers take meaty positions in names such as valeant pharmaceuticals fleetcor technologies and spirit aerosystems these are of course tiger lineage favorites as most of these names hold in excess of  participants through our capture of all tiger “family members” before you prematurely conclude that overlap is a bad thing our data shows that tiger cub consensus names greatly outperform and the same can’t be said about all unique stocks most of these are world class managers and the securities they invest in have compounded at exceptional rates so perhaps they are on to something recent marble arch outperformance marble arch’s simulated long portfolio performance has been outpacing the sp  by about bps per year since our first public data capture in jan  a large amount of the portfolio’s outperformance began after the us debt ceiling crisis in the rd quarter of  structural changes if we look at their portfolio since then a few things become apparent in terms of structural changes the portfolio has reduced the number of long positions from a peak of   to  as of the most recent filing as a corollary portfolio concentration has risen dramatically constituting a  relative increase in terms of top   top  position concentration this has led to a greater allocation of larger positions in the portfolio as positions greater than  of reported assets have gone from nonexistent to nearly  of the book in the last  months that largest position size bucket has annualized at an astounding  which shows why the move to a more concentrated portfolio explains the widening outperformance we can truly isolate position sizing value add by comparing an equal weighted portfolio to their actual return profile this allows us to measure how additive the escalation in concentration has been for marble arch’s portfolio we estimate it has added nearly  bps of outperformance since september  finally if we simply sort the names with the highest average weighting during this period we can see a strong relationship between sizing and outsized return on invested capital in fact there has only been one notable miss applied materials amongst overweight positions this phenomenon is punctuated by the firm’s positioning in valeant which has been a huge driver of outperformance delivering over bps of simulated contribution with these trends we can see the manager engaging in a higher octane investment style with a clear escalation in the median pe of the portfolio as well as a widening negative beta to value conclusion marble arch’s reported long positions have had an extended period of outperformance beginning in late  this has coincided with a strong move towards increased concentration and is dominated by a growthfactor tilt the manager continues to outperform the market and has demonstrated adaptability in the past the question is whether or not this trend of amplified concentration and growth bias will persist if the market begins to change in tenor three managers three styles an analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha what makes a successful hedge fund manager we believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question by looking at thousands of active manager portfolios we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance these patterns can be viewed as investment skill or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods in this article we use public ownership data and the novus alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers the three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success investment skill what’s in the report analysis of a top longshort equity fund analysis of a top sector specialist analysis of a top longonly manager download our

a decent  through august the returns using a rolling six month time window offer insight into when the outperformance occurred recently the fund has experienced outperformance during late  and a large amount over the course of  but this does not demonstrate skills of the manager or provide insight into the portfolios aggregate dynamics so let’s dig in corvex management lp’s portfolio attributes asset growth position changes concentration corvex began filing in december of  and has seen almost a x increase in reported market value since december of  the market value of filed positions has almost doubled from b to b this rapid increase in asset growth must cause a change in the portfolio whether changes in market cap number of positions or concentration this growth probably stems from a mix of large capital inflows captured in the filings spikes below and from the good performance of the fund while assets doubled to over b the number of securities has decreased  from a peak of  positions to  currently if assets are growing while securities count decreases then the concentration of the portfolio must increase indeed the portfolio’s concentration has increased corvex has become heavily concentrated in their  securities while assets rose and this shifted from around  the historical average in december of  to  its peak currently this concentration has increased steadily in the top  securities the top  securities represent approximately  of the portfolio a highly concentrated book considering that the other  securities represent the remaining  this has steadily increased from  in december of  we are only examining the publicly filed long positions but we gain insight into how these dynamics are changing as the assets grow what does this increased concentration mean for the portfolio usually this will indicate that we should see higher winloss ratios as the portfolio focuses on generating most of its returns from fewer positions corvex management lp’s position breakdown and attribution at an aggregate portfolio level corvex has put up some impressive numbers it has owned  securities  have been up with  of capital allocated to those winning names which has led to approximately a x winloss ratio this means that each winning name has contributed twice as much to the portfolio as the average loser has detracted which is good but not fantastic for an activist let’s breakdown these aggregate stats into the underlying positions the top contributing position has been williams wmb generating bps with an average position size of  which is about the same contribution as the next three positions in comparison the top detractor yum detracted bps and only  securities have detracted more than bps demonstrating an ability to cut their losers digging into the williams position corvex built into the position over time and filed a d in december  after reaching an agreement for a board seat with williams in february  they increased their shares in march  williams has stayed above a  position since then with most of the contribution occurring from june  until presently williams’ contribution to the fund is driven by security selection meaning that the individual security generated contribution and not from the relative factors of the market and sector the effect of its activist investment seems to be taking hold and finally paying off another security that drove performance in  was fidelity fnf it has generated approx bps with an average position size of  corvex announced its investment through a d filing in october of  although the security initially detracted it began to outperform half way through  and is corvex’s second highest contributor there is a delay to the activist’s ability to generate value in these longer term investments and because corvex is still invested in them we will have to wait and see how it plays out breaking down the top contributors on a relative basis we see all but four of them have generated greater than  of their contribution from security selection corvex’s winners are winners because of security selection but let’s compare this to the largest average positions sorting on avg pos size reveals that of the positions greater than  only  of them have detracted value but williams is the only major contributor this provides context for the great batting averages but that their other investments have not paid off or did not generate the excess returns that an activist needs from its concentrated positions returning to the portfolio level metrics corvex has demonstrated an ability to pick and allocate to outperformers with a  batting average and  of capital deployed to those names this has led to around bps of security selection that is an impressive amount of stock selection corvex can picks names and allocate capital but has only had one large winner so far let’s dive under the hood and examine corvex’s investments across several additional dimensions to understand how this switch towards a more concentrated strategy has affected the book corvex management lp’s sector allocations the sector allocations initially centered on energy consumer discretionary and tech and became more balanced as it grew but in  the fund began to concentrate again and now focuses on consumer discretionary energy and financials which represent  of the portfolio while cutting telecom and utilities regardless of sector corvex has an ability to pick winning names every sector has above  batting averages and those below  industrials and materials make up less than  of the current long book in terms of the winloss ratios  of the portfolio is allocated to sectors that have greater than x winloss ratios as an activist we expect highwin loss ratios but corvex has shifted away from sectors that do not contribute like industrials technology and materials corvex has demonstrated an ability to identify the sectors they do not do well in and get out of them to focus on those that they perform well in telecomm has an incredible winloss ratio of x so let’s see what names are contributing to this outsized ratio lvlt abvt twtc are the largest contributions and positions but only one of these securities had a position size greater than  the winloss ratio stems from these medium size positions offering healthy contribution and only a few tiny positions detracting although a successful sector it has not been a heavy allocation for them but the few names they have invested in did well overall corvex has picked winning names across sectors but has learned over its short time to focus on the sectors it knows best and drive the best batting averages and winloss ratios these metrics across their favorites sectors will be something to follow because it is still early to judge the results of this newer concentration strategy corvex management lp’s market cap market cap has predominately been large cap and mid cap and has shifted upwards slightly towards more large and even mega cap names all batting averages are over  across the spectrum indicating they can pick names well but the winloss ratio is what matters for an activist across the spectrum corvex has above x winloss ratios with mega large mid and small cap having x x x and x ratios respectively although these are good they could be better again it is still early to tell how these longer and larger investments will pay off on a roic basis the larger buckets have performed better with each above  and only microcap a minor allocation in the past detracted across the larger buckets they have also generated alpha through stock selection overall they understand their investments on a market cap basis and have shifted into their best market cap bucket corvex management lp’s concentration returning to our question about concentration we see that corvex has shifted into larger position sizes since march of  specifically since december of  position sizes have more than doubled from  to  we know that the fund has become concentrated in these positions and that some of those names like williams and fidelity have generated returns but have done so slowly and steadily over  and  these names still need more time to play out in an activist play we can compare the portfolio’s returns against an equally weighted portfolio’s to understand if the fund has added value and we see two periods in  and  with outperformance we know that these are some early effects of their new concentration strategy like their positions in wmb and flf ultimately this concentration play has contributed to the portfolio but it is a little early to conclusively know because it is still running its course we know corvex has had good batting averages and decent winloss ratios meaning corvex picks winning names but needs time for them to generate those larger returns we expect from concentrated positions conclusion corvex may only have been around since  but this fund has demonstrated a skill for picking winning securities across sectors and market cap buckets they understand what sectors and market caps they are good at and know to focus on them while getting out of those that do not perform well for them corvex has solid winloss ratios in those areas but it could be better especially for an activist this can get better as these new investments have more time for the activist influence to gain transaction at the targeted companies even as corvex experienced extraordinary asset growth it maintained its ability to pick names and continues to adapt to its concentrated strategy although an icahn protégé started corvex it has found a style and skillset all its own as it continues to focus corvex is a manager that we will watch closely as it continues to grow and its investments have more time to play out three managers three styles an analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha what makes a successful hedge fund manager we believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question by looking at thousands of active manager portfolios we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance these patterns can be viewed as investment skill or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods in this article we use public ownership data and the novus alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers the three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success
