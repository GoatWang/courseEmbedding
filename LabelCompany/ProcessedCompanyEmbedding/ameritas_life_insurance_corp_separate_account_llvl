benefit proceeds to the policy beneficiary upon the insureds death or pays a cash surrender value to you if you surrender the policy the insured cannot be over age  on the insureds birthday nearest the policy issue date we will only issue the policy for an initial specified amount of insurance coverage of  or more you have flexibility under the policy within certain limits you can vary the amount and timing of premium payments change the death benefit and transfer amounts among the investment options you may allocate policy premium and value among several different variable investment options where you can gain or lose money on your investment or to a fixed rate option where we guarantee you will earn a fixed rate of interest you can take out a policy loan make a partial withdrawal or surrender your policy completely subject to certain restrictions however unpaid loans partial withdrawals and surrenders may be subject to income tax and penalty tax and unpaid loans and withdrawals will decrease death benefit protection and may cause the need for additional premium to keep the policy in force your policy value and death benefit will go up or down as a result of the investment experience of your policy the fund prospectuses accompanying this policy prospectus provide comprehensive discussion of the risks of each portfolio even if you pay planned periodic premiums your policy could lapse if the policy value is not enough to pay the policys charges your policys death benefit will never be less than the then current specified amount of insurance coverage less any outstanding loans and loan interest and less any due but unpaid policy charges the policy remains in force until surrendered for its cash surrender value or all proceeds have been paid as a death benefit or until it lapses because the cash surrender value is insufficient to keep the policy in force buying a policy might not be advisable if it is just replacing existing life insurance you may

following charges are deducted from policy value on each policy month date o cost of insurance charge the cost of insurance rate per  of net amount at risk cannot exceed the guaranteed cost of insurance rate that is set forth in the policy the maximum cost of insurance each month can be determined by using the guaranteed cost of insurance rate in the formula below for cost of insurance the cost of insurance charge is for providing insurance protection under the policy because the cost of insurance charge depends upon several variables the cost for each policy month can vary from month to month the cost of insurance rate for the initial specified amount of insurance coverage varies by the insureds sex issue age risk class and the length of time the policy has been in force the cost of insurance rate for an increase in specified amount varies by the insureds sex age and risk class at the time of the increase and the length of time the policy has been in force since the increase we may use current cost of insurance rates less than those shown in the policy and reserve the right to change them so long as they do not exceed the rates shown in the policy changes will equally apply to similarly situated policy owners and be based on changes in future expectations of factors such as investment earnings mortality persistency and expenses we expect a profit from this charge ask for a policy illustration or see your policy for these charges applicable to you the cost of insurance each month equals  the net amount at risk for the month multiplied by  the cost of insurance rate per  of net amount at risk divided by   the net amount at risk in any month equals  the death benefit on the policy month date discounted at the guaranteed rate of interest for the fixed account

the measures we take will be effective in preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity our ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations the discretionary nature of our disruptive trading procedures may result in some policy owners being able to

program solely for purposes of development of the models and periodic updates to the models you must give aic your written consent and discretionary authority for aic to give us instructions to

general account it is subject to the claims of our creditors we receive a benefit from all amounts left in the general account tax matters the following is only general information about federal tax law and is not intended as tax advice to any individual tax laws affecting the policy are complex may change and are affected by your facts and circumstances we cannot guarantee the tax treatment of the policy or any transaction involving the policy you should consult your own tax adviser as to how these general rules and any applicable taxes will apply to you if you purchase a policy life insurance qualification tax treatment of death benefit the internal revenue code as amended the code defines a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes this definition can be met if an insurance contract satisfies either one of two tests the code and related regulations do not directly address the manner in which these tests should be applied to certain features of the policy thus there is some uncertainty about how those tests apply to the policy nevertheless we believe the policy qualifies as a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes so that o the death benefit should be fully excludable from the beneficiarys gross income and o you should not be considered in constructive receipt of the cash surrender value including any increases in cash surrender value unless and until it is distributed from the policy however congress has recently enacted new statutory provisions relating to employer owned life insurance the death benefit of life insurance owned by an employer is taxable unless the insured is a certain class of employee and has been given notice and has consented to coverage on his life specific statutory requirements must be satisfied for the death benefit of employer owned life insurance to be excluded from taxable income any employer contemplating the purchase of a life insurance contract should consult a tax advisor we reserve the right to make such changes in the policy as we deem necessary to assure it qualifies as a life insurance contract under the code and continues to provide the tax benefits of such qualification modified endowment contracts the code establishes a class of life insurance contracts designated as modified endowment contracts distributions from a modified endowment contract are taxed under different rules most notably distributions are treated as from income first to the extent of any gain in the contract then from cost basis there are other differences related modified endowment contracts such as loans being treated as a distribution see tax treatment of loans and other distributions below the code rules governing whether a policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract are extremely complex in general a policy is a modified endowment contract if the accumulated premium payments made at any time during the first seven policy years exceed the sum of the net level premium payments which would have been paid on or before such time if the policy provided for paidup future benefits after the payment of seven level annual premiums a policy may also become a modified endowment contract because of a material change the determination of whether a policy is a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the policys death benefit and policy value at the time of such change and the additional premium payments made in the seven years following the material change a policy may also become a modified endowment contract if the death benefit is reduced this policys flexibility and how you tailor it to meet your needs could cause it to be a modified endowment contract we recommend you consult with a tax adviser to determine if desired policy transactions may cause such treatment when a premium payment is credited which we believe causes the policy to become a modified endowment contract we will notify you and offer you the opportunity to request a refund of that premium in order to avoid such treatment you have  days after receiving such a notice to request the refund  paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a policy issued in exchange for a modified endowment contract is also treated as a modified endowment contract however we believe that a policy issued in exchange for a life insurance policy that is not a modified endowment contract will generally not be treated as a modified endowment contract if the death benefit of the policy is greater than or equal to the death benefit of the policy being exchanged the payment of any premiums at the time of or after the exchange may however cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract you may of course choose to not make additional payments in order to prevent a policy from being treated as a modified endowment contract special considerations for corporations and employers premium paid by a business for a life insurance policy is not deductible as a business expense or otherwise if the business is directly or indirectly a beneficiary of the policy for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt that may be imposed on corporations the death benefit from the policy even though excluded from gross income for normal tax purposes is included in adjusted current earnings for amt purposes in addition although increases to the policys cash surrender value are generally excluded from gross income for normal income tax purposes such increases are included in adjusted current earnings for income tax purposes in  congress adopted new rules relating to employer owned life insurance any employer contemplating the purchase of a new life insurance contract or a change in an existing contract should consult a tax adviser regarding the employee notice and consent requirements to avoid the income taxation of the life insurance death benefits tax treatment of loans and other distributions upon a surrender or lapse of the policy if the amount received plus any outstanding policy debt exceeds the total cost basis in the policy the excess will generally be treated as ordinary income subject to tax regardless of whether a policy is or is not a modified endowment contract however the tax consequences of distributions from and loans taken from or secured by a policy depend on whether the policy is classified as a modified endowment contract cost basis in the policy means  the total of any premium payments or other consideration paid for the policy minus  any withdrawals previously recovered that were not taxable distributions from policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules  all distributions including surrenders and partial withdrawals are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the cost basis in the policy at such time  loans from or secured by the policy are treated as distributions and taxed accordingly if you do not repay loan interest the loan interest itself is treated as a distribution  a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution from or loan taken from or secured by the policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan is made on or after the owner attains age   is attributable to the owners becoming disabled or is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the owner and the owners beneficiary distributions from policies not classified as modified endowment contracts are generally treated as first recovering the cost basis in the policy and then only after the return of all such cost basis in the policy as distributing taxable income an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the owner in order for the policy to continue complying with the codes definition of life insurance such a cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income to the extent of any gain in the policy loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not treated as distributions however it is possible that reduced rate loans could be treated as distributions rather than loans distributions including upon surrender and loans from or secured by a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are not subject to the  additional income tax rule if a policy which is not now but later becomes a modified endowment contract because of a reduction in benefits then any distributions made from the policy within two years prior to the change will become taxable pursuant to modified endowment contract rules  paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th other policy owner tax matters depending on the circumstances the exchange of a policy a policy loan a partial or full surrender a lapse a change in ownership or an assignment of the policy may have federal income tax consequences in addition federal state and local transfer and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of distributions from a policy depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary interest paid on policy loans generally is not tax deductible aggregation of modified endowment contracts predeath distributions including a loan partial surrender collateral assignment or full surrender from a policy that is treated as a modified endowment contract may require a special aggregation to determine the amount of income recognized on the policy if we or any of our affiliates issue more than one modified endowment contract to the same policy owner within any month period then for purposes of measuring the income on the policy with respect to a distribution from any of those policies the income for all those policies will be aggregated and attributed to that distribution federal and state estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of proceeds under the policy depend upon your or the beneficiarys individual circumstance diversification requirements investments of the separate account must be adequately diversified for the policy to qualify as a life insurance contract under the code any failure to comply with diversification requirements could subject you to immediate taxation on the incremental increases in policy value plus the cost of insurance protection for the year however we believe the policy complies fully with such requirements owner control the treasury department stated that it anticipates the issuance of regulations or rulings prescribing the circumstances in which your control of the investments of the separate account may cause you rather than us to be treated as the owner of the assets in the separate account to date no such regulations or guidance has been issued if you are considered the owner of the assets of the separate account income and gains from the separate account would be included in your gross income the ownership rights under the policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described by the irs in rulings in which it determined that owners were not owners of separate account assets for example you have additional flexibility in allocating policy premium and policy values these differences could result in you being treated as the owner of a pro rata share of the assets of the separate account in addition we do not know what standards will be set forth in the regulations or rulings which the treasury may issue we therefore reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered the owner of the assets of the separate account taxadvantaged arrangements the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans tax exempt and nonexempt welfare benefit plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement if you are contemplating the use of the policy in any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences you

their original cost morningstarr asset allocator model asset allocation program offered through ameritas investment corp aic the service ameritas investment corp aic an affiliate of ours has developed several asset allocation models each based on different profiles of an investors willingness to accept investment risk and marketed exclusively through our policies as the morningstar asset allocator program aic periodically typically annually evaluates and updates the models in developing and periodically updating the models aic currently relies on the recommendations of morningstar associates llc aic may change the firm it uses or may use no independent firm at all if you choose to subscribe to the morningstar asset allocator program aic will serve as your investment adviser for the service solely for purposes of development of the program models and periodic updates of the models if you choose to subscribe to the morningstar asset allocator program aic instructs us to allocate your initial premium in the case of a new application or accumulated value as applicable to the investment options according to the model you select to similarly allocate subsequent premium and to periodically automatically reallocate your accumulated value or premium payments your policy value will be rebalanced quarterly consistent with your selected model the morningstar asset allocator models development of the morningstar asset allocator models is a twostep process first an optimization analysis is performed to determine the breakdown of asset classes next after the asset class exposures are known a determination is made of how available investment options can be used to implement the asset class level allocations the investment options are selected by evaluating the asset classes represented by the underlying portfolios and combining investment options to arrive at the desired asset class exposure investment options are selected in a way intended to optimize potential returns for each model given a particular level of risk tolerance this process could in some cases result in the inclusion of an investment option in a model based on its specific asset class exposure or other specific optimization factors even where another investment option may have better historical performance periodic updates of the models and notices of updates each model is evaluated periodically generally annually to assess whether the combination of investment options within each model should be changed to better seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance intended for the model as a result each model may change and the investment options used within a model may change when your selected model is updated aic instructs us to automatically reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in accordance with any changes to the model you have selected this means the allocation of your accumulated value and potentially the investment options in which you are invested will automatically change and your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments will be automatically reallocated among the investment options in your updated model independently of the automatic quarterly rebalancing aic requires that you give it discretionary investment authority to periodically instruct us to reallocate your accumulated value and any subsequent premium payments in accordance with the updated version of the model you have selected if you wish to participate in the morningstar asset allocation program alic separate account llvl sai  statement of additional information paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th when aic update the models we will send you written notice of the updated models at least  days in advance of the date the updated models are to be effective if you wish to accept the changes in your selected model you will not need to take any action as your policy value and any subsequent premium will be automatically reallocated pursuant to the updated model if you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected model you can change to a different model or withdraw from the morningstar asset allocator program risks although asset allocation models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels of risk there is no assurance that a model portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience volatility investment performance of your accumulated value could be better or worse by participating in a morningstar asset allocator model than if you had not participated a model may perform better or worse than any single investment option or asset class or other combinations of investment options or asset classes model performance is dependent upon the performance of the component investment options and their underlying portfolios the timing of your investment and the automatic quarterly rebalancing may affect performance your accumulated value will fluctuate and when redeemed may be worth more or less than the original cost periodic updating of the models can cause the underlying portfolios to incur transaction expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of the portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the portfolios these expenses can adversely affect performance of the pertinent portfolios and the models aic an affiliate of ours may be subject to competing interests that have the potential to influence its decision making with regard to the models in addition to its limited role as investment advisor under the morningstar asset allocator program aic is also compensated by us as principal underwriter for the policies in addition aic receives fees as distributor for the summit mutual funds inc summit pinnacle series we and aic may receive revenue sharing from other portfolios that are available as investment options aic may have an incentive to use certain portfolios in the models that provide higher revenue sharing or distribution fees aic may believe that certain portfolios may benefit from additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions all our model investment options and their underlying portfolios are analyzed by morningstar associates llc an independent analytical firm neither aic nor we dictate to morningstar the number of portfolios in a model the percent that any portfolio represents in a model or which portfolios may be selected other than to require exclusion of any portfolio that is expected to be liquidated merged into another portfolio or otherwise closed aic and we believe reliance on recommendations of morningstar to develop and update the models reduces or eliminates the potential for aic and us to be influenced by these competing interests but there can be no assurance of this aic and we are under no obligation to continue the morningstar asset allocator program or any asset allocation program and have the right to terminate or change such

the payment of a minimum death benefit upon the second death the amount of the minimum death benefit  sometimes referred to as the specified amount of your policy  is chosen by you at the time your policy is established however death benefit proceeds  the actual amount that will be paid after ameritas receives satisfactory proof of death  may vary over the life of your policy depending on which of the two available coverage options you select if you choose option a the death benefit payable under your policy will be the specified amount of your policy or the applicable percentage of its accumulation value whichever is greater if you choose option b the death benefit payable under your policy will be the specified amount of your policy plus the accumulation value of your policy or if it is higher the applicable percentage of the accumulation value on the second death in either case the applicable percentage is established based on the attained age at the second death page  are there any risks involved in owning a policy yes over the life of your policy the subaccounts to which you allocate your premiums will fluctuate with changes in the stock market and overall economic factors these fluctuations will be reflected in the accumulation value of your policy and may result in loss of principal for this reason the purchase of a policy may not be suitable for all individuals it may not be advantageous to purchase a policy to replace or augment your existing insurance arrangements appendix a includes tables illustrating the impact that hypothetical market returns would have on accumulation values under a policy page a what is the premium that must be paid to keep a policy in force like traditional life insurance policies a policy requires the payment of periodic premiums in order to keep the policy in force you will be asked to establish a payment schedule before your policy becomes effective the distinction between traditional life policies and a policy is that a policy will not lapse simply because premium payments are not made according to that payment schedule however a policy will lapse even if scheduled premium payments are made if the net cash surrender value of your policy falls below zero or premiums paid do not in the aggregate equal the premium necessary to satisfy the minimum benefit page  or the guaranteed death benefit requirements page  how are premiums paid processed and credited to me your policy will be issued after a completed application is accepted and the initial premium payment is received by ameritas at its home office ameritas home office is located at  o street po box  lincoln ne  your initial net premium will be allocated to the liquid asset portfolio for thirteen days after the issue date then the accumulation value of the policy will be allocated among the subaccounts andor the fixed account according to the instructions in your application where allowed if you have allocated  to the fixed account the net premium of the policy is allocated to the fixed account on the issue date in this instance no further allocation will occur you have the right to examine your policy and return it for a refund for a limited time even after the issue date page  you may make subsequent premium payments according to your planned periodic premium schedule although you are not required to do so ameritas will send premium payment notices to you according to any schedule you select except if you pay by automatic bank draft when ameritas receives your premium payment at its home office any applicable percent of premium charge for taxes will be deducted and the net premium will be allocated to the subaccounts andor the fixed account according to your selections page  as already noted provides you considerable flexibility in determining the frequency and amount of premium payments this flexibility is not however unlimited you should keep certain factors in mind in determining the payment schedule that is best suited to your needs these include the amount of the minimum premium guaranteed death benefit premium andor net policy funding requirement needed to keep your policy in force

cash surrender value of your policy page  is the accumulation value of my policy available without surrender yes you may access the value of your policy in one of two ways first you may obtain a loan secured by the accumulation value of your policy the maximum interest rate on any such loan is  annually the current rate is  annually after the tenth policy anniversary you may borrow against a limited amount of the net cash surrender value of your policy at a maximum annual interest rate of  the current rate for such loans is  annually page  you may also access the value of your policy by making a partial withdrawal a partial withdrawal is subject to a maximum charge not to exceed the lesser of  or  of the amount withdrawn currently the partial withdrawal charge is the lesser of  or  page  are there any other charges associated with ownership of a policy certain states impose premium and other taxes in connection with insurance policies such as the policy ameritas may deduct up to  of each premium as a percent of premium charge for taxes currently  is deducted for this purpose charges are deducted against the accumulation value to cover the cost of insurance under the policy and to compensate ameritas for administering each individual policy these charges which are part of the monthly deduction are calculated and paid on each monthly activity date the cost of insurance is calculated based on risk factors relating to the insureds as reflected in relevant actuarial tables the administrative expense charges may be based on your specified amount and the policy duration however they may be increased during the life of your policy up to a maximum of  per month plus a charge per month per  of specified amount that depends on the younger insureds issue age for issue ages    the rate is  for issue ages    the rate is  for issue ages    the rate is  and for issue ages  and over it is  at the current time we anticipate the charge will reduce to  in year  the administrative expense charge may be levied throughout the life of the policy and is guaranteed not to increase above  per month plus  per month per  of specified amount for issue ages   for issue ages  and  for issue ages  and over ameritas does not expect to make any profit from the administrative expense charge for its services in administering separate account llvl and subaccounts and as compensation for bearing certain mortality and expense risksameritas is also entitled to receive fees these fees are calculated daily during the first  years of each policy at a combined annual rate of  of the value of the net assets of separate account llvl after the th policy anniversary date the combined annual rate will decrease to  of the daily net assets of separate account llvl the charge is guaranteed never to exceed  no mortality and expense risk charge will be deducted from the amounts in the fixed account page  policy owners who choose to allocate net premiums to one or more of the subaccounts will also bear a pro rata share of the management fees and expenses paid by each of the investment portfolios in which the various subaccounts invest no such management fees are assessed against net premiums allocated to the fixed account page  when does my policy terminate you may terminate your policy by surrendering the policy while at least one insured is alive for its net cash surrender value page  as noted above your policy will terminate if you fail to pay required premiums or maintain sufficient net cash surrender value to cover policy charges page  year  like other insurance companies and their separate accounts ameritas and separate account llvl could be adversely affected if the computer systems they rely upon do not properly process daterelated information

ameritas  purposes of the policy the policy is designed to provide the policy owner with both lifetime insurance protection and flexibility in the amount and frequency of premium payments and with the level of life insurance proceeds payable under the policy you are not required to pay scheduled premiums to keep the policy in force but you may subject to certain limitations vary the frequency and amount of premium payments you also may adjust the level of death benefits payable under the policy without having to purchase a new policy by increasing with evidence of insurability or decreasing the specified amount an increase in the specified amount will increase both the minimum premium and the guaranteed death benefit premium required if the specified amount is decreased however the minimum premium and guaranteed death benefit premium will not decrease thus as insurance needs or financial conditions change you have the flexibility to adjust life insurance benefits and vary premium payments the death benefit may and the accumulation value will vary with the investment experience of the chosen subaccounts of separate account llvl thus the policy owner benefits from any appreciation in value of the underlying assets but bears the investment risk of any depreciation in value as a result whether or not a policy continues in force may depend in part upon the investment experience of the chosen subaccounts the failure to pay a planned periodic premium will not necessarily cause the policy to lapse but the policy could lapse even if planned periodic premiums have been paid depending upon the investment experience of separate account llvl if the minimum premium or guaranteed death benefit premium is satisfied by net policy funding ameritas will keep the policy in

practice for comparable survivorship flexible premium variable universal life policies the mortality risk assumed by ameritas is that insureds may live for a shorter time than calculated and that the

does not purport to be complete or cover all situations this discussion is not intended as tax advice no attempt has been made to consider in detail any applicable state or other tax except premium taxes see the section on deductions from premium payments laws this discussion is based upon ameritas understanding of the relevant laws at the time of filing counsel and other competent tax advisors should be consulted for more complete llsvul  psrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd information before a policy is purchased ameritas makes no representation as to the likelihood of the continuation of present federal income tax laws nor of the interpretations by the internal revenue service federal tax laws are subject to change and thus tax consequences to the insuredspolicy owner or beneficiary may be altered  taxation of ameritas ameritas is taxed as a life insurance company under part i of subchapter l of the internal revenue code of  the code at this time since separate account llvl is not a separate entity from ameritas and its operations form a part of ameritas it will not be taxed separately as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code net investment income and realized net capital gains on the assets of separate account llvl are reinvested and automatically retained as a part of the reserves of the policy and are taken into account in determining the death benefit and accumulation value of the policy ameritas believes that separate account llvl net investment income and realized net capital gains will not be taxable to the extent that such income and gains are retained as reserves under the policy ameritas does not currently expect to incur any additional federal income tax liability attributable to separate account llvl with respect to the sale of the policies accordingly no charge is being made currently to separate account llvl for federal income taxes if however ameritas determines that it may incur such taxes attributable to separate account llvl it may assess a charge for such taxes against separate account llvl ameritas may also incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes for which a deduction from premiums is currently made at present they are not charges against separate account llvl if there is a material change in state or local tax laws charges for such taxes attributable to separate account llvl if any may be assessed against separate account llvl  tax status of the policy the code section  includes a definition of a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes which places limitations on the amount of premiums that may be paid for the policy and the relationship of the accumulation value to the death benefit while ameritas believes that the policy meets the statutory definition of a life insurance contract under internal revenue code section  and should receive federal income tax treatment consistent with that of a fixedbenefit life insurance policy the area of tax law relating to the definition of life insurance does not explicitly address all relevant issues including for example certain tax requirements relating to survivorship variable universal life policies ameritas reserves the right to make changes to the policy if deemed appropriate by ameritas to attempt to assure qualification of the policy as a life insurance contract if the policy were determined not to qualify as life insurance under code section  the policy would not provide the tax advantages normally provided by life insurance if the death benefit of a policy is changed the applicable defined limits may change the code section a also defines a modified endowment contract for federal tax purposes if a life insurance policy is classified as a modified endowment contract distributions from it including loans are taxed as ordinary income to the extent of any gain this policy will become a modified endowment contract if the premiums paid into the policy fail to meet a pay premium test as outlined in section a of the code basically section a of the code defines a modified endowment contract as a policy issued or materially changed on or after june   on which the total premiums paid during the first seven years exceed the amount that would have been paid if the policy provided for paid up benefits after seven level annual premiums certain benefits the policy owner may elect under this policy may be material changes that affect or cause retesting under the pay premium test these include but are not limited to changes in death benefits and changes in the specified amount one may avoid a policy becoming a modified endowment contract by among other things not making excessive payments or reducing benefits should you deposit excessive premiums during a policy year that portion that is returned by ameritas within  days after the policy anniversary date will reduce the premiums paid to prevent the policy from becoming a modified endowment contract all modified endowment policies issued by ameritas to the same policy owner in any  month period are treated as one modified endowment contract for purposes of determining taxable gain under section e of the internal revenue code any life insurance policy received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will also be treated as a modified endowment contract you should contact a competent tax professional before paying additional premiums or making other changes to the policy to determine whether such payments or changes would cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract the code section h also authorizes the secretary of the treasury the treasury to set standards by regulation or otherwise for the investments of separate account llvl to be adequately diversified in order llsvul  psth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th for the policy to be treated as a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes separate account llvl through the funds intends to comply with the diversification requirements prescribed by the treasury in regulations published in the federal register on march   which affect how the funds assets may be invested ameritas does not have control over the funds or their investments however ameritas believes that the funds will be operated in compliance with the diversification requirements of the internal revenue code thus ameritas believes that the policy will be treated as a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes in connection with the issuance of regulations relating to the diversification requirements the treasury announced that such regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to which policy owners may direct their investments to particular divisions of a separate account regulations in this regard may be issued in the future it is not clear what these regulations will provide nor whether they will be prospective only it is possible that when regulations are issued the policy may need to be modified to comply with such regulations for these reasons ameritas reserves the right to modify the policy as necessary to prevent the policy owner from being considered the owner of the assets of separate account llvl or otherwise to qualify the policy for favorable tax treatment the following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes  tax treatment of policy proceeds ameritas believes that the policy will be treated in a manner consistent with a fixed benefit life insurance policy for federal income tax purposes thus ameritas believes that the death benefit will generally be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary under section a of the code and the policy owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the accumulation value under the policy until its actual surrender distributions from policies that are not modified endowment contracts  distributions while one or both insureds are still alive from a policy that is not a modified endowment contract are generally treated as first a recovery of the investment in the policy and then only after the return of all such investment as disbursing taxable income however in the case of a decrease in the death benefit a partial withdrawal a change in death benefit option or any other such change that reduces future benefits under the policy during the first  years after a policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue complying with the section  defined limits on premiums and accumulation values such distributions will be taxable as ordinary income to the policy owner to the extent of any gain in the policy as prescribed in section  in addition upon a complete surrender or lapse of a policy that is not a modified endowment contract if the amount received plus the amount of any outstanding policy debt exceeds the total investment in the policy the excess will generally be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes investment in the policy means  the total amount of any premiums paid for the policy plus the amount of any loan received under the policy to the extent the loan is included in gross income of the policy owner minus  the total amount received under the policy by the policy owner that was excludable from gross income excluding any nontaxable loan received under the policy ameritas also believes that loans received under a policy that is not a modified endowment contract will be treated as debt of the policy owner and that no part of any loan under a policy will constitute income to the policy owner so long as the policy remains in force should the policy lapse while policy loans are outstanding the portion of the loans attributable to earnings will become taxable generally interest paid on any loan under a policy owned by an individual will not be taxdeductible except for policies with respect to a limited number of key persons of an employer both as defined in the internal revenue code and subject to applicable interest rate caps the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the health insurance act generally repeals the deduction for interest paid or accrued after october   on loans from corporate owned life insurance policies on the lives of officers employees or persons financially interested in the taxpayers trade or business certain transitional rules for existing debt are included in the health insurance act the transitional rules include a phaseout of the deduction for debt incurred  before january   or  before january   for policies entered into in  or  the phaseout of the interest expense deduction occurs over a transition period between october   and january   there is also a special rule for prejune   policies the taxpayer relief act of  tra  further expanded the interest deduction disallowance for businesses by providing with respect to policies issued after june   that no deduction is allowed for interest paid or accrued on any debt with respect to life insurance covering the life of any individual except as noted above under pre law with respect to key persons and pre june   policies tra  also provides that no deduction is permissible for premiums paid on a life llsvul  psth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th insurance policy if the taxpayer is directly or indirectly a beneficiary under the policy also under tra  and subject to certain exceptions for policies issued after june   no deduction is allowed for that portion of a taxpayers interest expense that is allocable to unborrowed policy cash values this disallowance generally does not apply to policies owned by natural persons policy owners should consult a competent tax advisor concerning the tax implications of these changes for their policies distributions from policies that are modified endowment contracts should  the policy become a modified endowment contract partial withdrawals full surrenders assignments pledges and loans including loans to pay loan interest under the policy will be taxable to the extent of any gain under the policy a  penalty tax also applies to the taxable portion of any distribution prior to the taxpayers age   the  penalty tax does not apply if the distribution is made because the taxpayer is disabled as defined under the code or if the distribution is paid out in the form of a life annuity on the life of the taxpayer or the joint lives of the taxpayer and beneficiary the right to exchange the policy for a survivorship flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy see the section on exchange privilege the right to change policy owners see the section on general provisions and the provision for partial withdrawals see the section on surrenders may have tax consequences depending on the circumstances of such exchange change or withdrawal upon complete surrender if the amount received plus any outstanding policy debt exceeds the total premiums paid the basis that are not treated as previously withdrawn by the policy owner the excess generally will be taxed as ordinary income federal estate and state and local estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of death benefit proceeds depend on applicable law and the circumstances of each policy owner or beneficiary in addition if the policy is used in connection with taxqualified retirement plans certain limitations prescribed by the internal revenue service on and rules with respect to the taxation of life insurance protection provided through such plans may apply the advice of competent tax counsel should be sought in connection with use of life insurance in a qualified plan safekeeping of the separate accounts assets ameritas

tables shows the accumulated value of the premiums paid at  the following columns show the net cash surrender values and the death benefits for uniform hypothetical rates of return shown in these

currently sells its policies the maximum cost of insurance rates allowable under the policy are based upon the  commissioners standard ordinary smoker and nonsmoker male and female mortality tables ameritas anticipates reflecting future improvements in actual mortality experience through adjustments in the current cost of insurance rates actually applied ameritas also anticipates reflecting any future improvements in expenses incurred by applying lower percent of premiums of loads and other expense deductions the death benefits and cash values shown in the tables on pages a and a are based on the assumption that the maximum allowable cost of insurance rates as described above guaranteed cost and maximum allowable expense deductions are made throughout the life of the policy the amounts shown for the net cash surrender values and death benefits reflect the fact that the net investment return of the subaccounts is lower than the gross aftertax return of the assets held in the funds as a result of expenses paid by the fund and charges levied against the subaccounts the values shown take into account an average of the daily expenses paid by each portfolio available for investment the

objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same a comparison of the investment objectives strategies and risks of the replacement portfolio and the current portfolio is included in the application  the following table compares the fees and expenses of the current portfolio and the replacement portfolio as of the year ended december    current portfolioreplacement portfoliocalvert

through april   to  under the terms of the contractual expense limitation operating expenses do not include interest expense brokerage commissions taxes and extraordinary expenses only the board of directors of cvsi may terminate a portfolios expense cap before the contractual period expires the advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of  or  for net operating expenses of  to maintain a positive yield during the year ended december    the applicants state that the proposed substitution is in response to a decision by the board of directors for cvsi at a meeting held on june   to approve the dissolution of the current portfolio on or about november   the “liquidation date” the boards decision to liquidate the current portfolio requires the life insurance companies to transfer accumulated contract value invested in the current portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the contracts on or before the liquidation date currently the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the contracts is the current portfolio accordingly the proposed substitution is necessary in order to provide the contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option consequently the life insurance companies have determined to replace the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio via the substitution  the life insurance companies submit that the replacement portfolio is an appropriate alternative for contract owners for several reasons first its investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the current portfolio second it is substantially larger than the current portfolio has had lower overall expense levels than the portfolio in recent years and has had higher yields in recent years than the current portfolio third the contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the life insurance companies currently offer one or more vipfv portfolios other than the replacement portfolio  the applicants believe that contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the replacement portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the replacement portfolio as contrasted start printed page with the size and recent yields of the current portfolio the yield for the current portfolio for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the current portfolio was  as of december   the yield for the replacement portfolio initial class shares for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the replacement portfolio supporting initial class shares was  as of december    the applicants believe that contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the replacement portfolio as compared to the current portfolio specifically the management fee other expenses and total operating expenses are less than those of the current portfolio both portfolios have no charge for rule b distribution and services fees the total annual operating expense of the replacement portfolio is less than that of the current portfolio given this decrease the applicants believe that the substitution would benefit contract owners by reducing the overall level of portfolio expenses legal analysis and conditions  the applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitution section c of the  act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is not the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of a proposed substitution which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption consequently the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption  applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include section c  applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the current portfolio and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio will be effected in accordance with section c of the act and rule c thereunder the substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the substitution “effective date” with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable account  contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio will be transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the substitution nor will their rights or the life insurance companies respective obligations under the contracts be altered in any way and the substitution will not change contract owners insurance benefits under the contracts all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by the life insurance companies in addition the substitution will not impose any tax liability on contract owners  the applicants also represent that the substitution will not cause the contract fees and charges currently paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution the life insurance companies will not exercise any right they may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the contracts for the period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice defined below through at least thirty  days following the effective date  existing contract owners will be notified of the proposed substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the contracts “presubstitution notice” at least thirty  days before the effective date new purchasers of the contracts will be provided the presubstitution notice the contract prospectus and the prospectus for the replacement portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements  the presubstitution notice will i state that the applicants filed the application seeking approval of the substitution ii set forth the anticipated

the date of the presubstitution notice until the effective date contract owners are permitted to transfer contract value out of any current portfolio subaccount to any other subaccounts offered under

that any contract value remaining in the current portfolio subaccount on the effective date will be transferred to a subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio and that the substitution will take place at relative net asset value vi inform contract owners that for at least thirty  days following the effective date the applicable life insurance company will permit contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio to any other available subaccounts offered under their contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees if any that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the contracts and vii inform contract owners that except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus the applicable life insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio for at least thirty  days after the effective date  all contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement portfolio prior to the substitution in addition within five  days following the substitution contract owners affected by the substitution will be notified in writing that the substitution was carried out this notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the presubstitution notice and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio were transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge start printed page including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge  the applicants represent that the life insurance companies will not receive for three  years after the effective date any direct or indirect benefits from the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates in connection with assets attributable to the contracts affected by the substitution at a higher rate than the life insurance companies had received from the current portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates including without limitation b fees revenue sharing or other arrangements the applicants further represent that the substitution and the selection of the replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a life insurance company or its affiliates by the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates  applicants submit that the replacement of the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and thus meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to section c of the  act in addition the applicants submit that the proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to substitutions that have been approved in the past conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application the applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in section c of the  act and should therefore be granted start

quotes » rates in less than  minutes  freesafe and secure home     »      term life insurance term life insurance a term life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium a term life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments this type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children people with debt obligations and also home buyers it can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy the premiums are based on your age and your health status purchasing a new term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues term life is a death benefit only policy that you buy for a specified length of time think of it like leasing a car you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over you return the car term life is referred to as benefit only insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as whole life it carries no cash surrender value because of this term life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check it is ideal for families that are just starting out or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected but may not be able to afford or desire a permanent life policy however understand that as a person ages over the period of the term monthly premiums may increase it is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse or for single people even for children just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered there are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a term life policy can make up for the investment component of a permanent life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own the earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy annual renewable term life policies are those that are purchased yearbyyear the next year you do not have to prequalify simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate rates for annual renewable policies are at historic lows a young healthy person can get  for only a few hundred dollars per year there are very good rates these days on term life the premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term usually   or  years it is not uncommon for a healthy nonsmoking  yearold male to obtain a  or year policy with a fixed premium of less than  per month so just how much insurance should you buy many things factor into that answer but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least  years of your present salary if you have young children make that around  years so if you make  a year that means at least  to  in coverage feel free to use our life insurance calculator to help determine the right amount for your
