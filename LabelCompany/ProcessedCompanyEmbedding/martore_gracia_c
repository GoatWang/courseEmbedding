forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ factors that may cause them to differ are outlined in our sec filings this presentation also includes certain nongaap financial measures weve provided reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures in the press release and on the investor relations portion of our web site with that i’ll turn the call to gracia gracia c martore thanks jeff and let me join jeff in welcoming all of you to our fourth quarter and yearend earnings call now i’m going to kick things off with highlights of our performance for the full year and also for the fourth quarter and after that i’m going to turn it over to dave lougee president of tegna media and alex vetter our ceo of carscom for a deeper dive on their respective businesses victoria will then cover the financial highlights for the quarter so lots to cover so let’s get right to it we remain focused on our anticipated spinoff carscom which will create key strong companies with leadership positions in their respective industries alex and the team there continue to make progress in their preparations for life as a separate company later this year our strategic review process for careerbuilder results are moving along we are confident that we along with our partners tegna media and mccarthy will find a solution that maximizes value for shareholders and puts careerbuilder in the best position to succeed for its customers and its employees so now let’s turn to our record performance for  which was more than consistent with what we shared with you in early december we closed out the year with substantial improvement on both the top line and bottom line as compared to  with revenue up  and nongaap earnings per share increasing  yearoveryear to  and we generated a substantial increase in adjusted ebitda which was  billion these improved results reflect solid performance across our segments as they continue to execute on their growth plans and strategic initiatives  was a strong year for tegna media tegna media revenue was at record levels driven by political spending continued digital growth the summer olympics which aired across our robust nbc footprint and substantial increases in retransmission fees which were up about  in  compared to the prior year on the tegna digital side  revenues were up about  reflecting growth of carscom and careerbuilder before we turn to fourth quarter performance we want to also note that with the change we made last year to go to a calendar year ’s fourth quarter was three days shorter than the  fourth quarter so you’ll want to make sure you are viewing our quarterly comps for media through that lens fortunately there will be no issues like this going forward in the fourth quarter tegna media revenues were up  over the prior year’s quarter excluding the three extra days in last year’s fourth quarter we saw strong growth in congressional and gubernatorial election spending thanks to our wellpositioned station footprint these races brought in more advertising dollars this year than during the  election and helped to partially offset the welldocumented lower presidential race spending dave will be providing a full report on our political results in a moment we also are very pleased with retransmission growth of over  million in the fourth quarter in addition our team made excellent progress negotiating new agreements replacing those that expired at the end of  which will drive growth in  and beyond now we continue to see a gap in the retransmission revenue we take in compared to the value we provide and we have been closing that gap for the last several quarters and will continue to work hard on that front we also recognize that  is a unique year for us in that we have a gap between the increase in retransmission fees we earn and the increase in reversed compensation this year as we have noted we plan to close that gap both with the new agreements we negotiated at year end and dave will share some good news on that front in a few moments as well as the initiatives we launched in  which combined were more than offset this exposure turning to digital digital segment revenue rose during the fourth quarter reflecting the midsingle digit revenue growth at carscom and careerbuilder these gains were unfavorably impacted by lost revenue as a result of our sale of the pointroll business in november of last year auto remains one of the fastest growing advertising verticals and we continue to see more and more marketing and advertising dollars shifting to a digital solution to capitalize on these expanding opportunities carscom is rolling out new products new apps a more userfriendly interface that provides unique value to dealers and shoppers alike cars’ strong brand recognition and leadership position coupled with favorable industry dynamics and continued hard work and innovation by the carscom team gives us confidence that it is positioned to reach its full potential as a standalone company alex will provide a deep dive on the specific initiatives underway in just a few moments  was a pivotal year for careerbuilder careerbuilder is one of the most innovative companies in the human capital space with an unmatched endtoend platform for more than two decades careerbuilder has led in recruitment with its terrific prehire platform now with its recent acquisition of workterra specializing in cloudbased benefits administration and talent management careerbuilder has moved into posthire solutions employers appreciate the expanded suite of services we now provide under one umbrella and we too are optimistic about the new doors and revenue growth opportunities these valueadd services open up for us the breadth and depth of careerbuilder solutions make the company a true human resources powerhouse lastly i want to comment briefly on our share buyback program as you saw in november we reactivated the program which had been temporarily suspended in connection with our anticipated spinoff of carscom our decision to begin buybacks again was based on our strong operational and financial performance and the board’s confidence in our ability to maintain strong cash flow levels and allocate capital strategically we will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases going forward now let me turn it over to dave for his thoughts on tegna media david t lougee thank you gracia as we had forecasted  was a year of records we had a record year for both revenue and ebitda and our stations outperformed our markets producing a record revenue share for our division demonstrating that our sales and content plans are working our focus on investment and innovation has been key to that growth i’ll leave the reporting of the numbers to victoria but let me start with retransmission that gracia referenced so very good news to start  we have stronger than projected retrans revenues due to stronger results and those yearend negotiations that covered  of our subscribers i’m pleased to report the resetting of rates that gracia referenced in her remarks will result in a  increase for retrans revenues in  higher than the range of  to  previously reported as a reminder as gracia also referenced on the expense side of the retrans equation we’re now making reverse compensation payments for the first time on  of our nbc stations we had most recently projected a onetime net retrans gap in  of  million to  million but now i’m pleased to say based on those yearend negotiations that gap has been reduced to  million to  million and as we planned our innovation initiatives which i’ll discuss in more detail shortly will more than cover that remaining net retrans gap back to retransmission on the topic of paytv subscribers new ott providers as we’ve talked about in the past have shown great interest in our portfolio of strong stations we’re in pretty much the final stages now of very productive negotiations with our network partners and ott providers some of them new ott providers also known as virtual mvpds which we’ll talk about in the future always as vmvpds only maybe if i can say it right given the strength of our stations and the size of our markets we’re ending up with very good economics on these agreements which will result in no lost income if a subscriber moves from a traditional mvpd to one of those new players furthermore some of these services are targeting socalled cordnevers with skinny bundles of channels at lower overall prices and that’s an opportunity for us to reach new consumers who have not yet before been in the paytv ecosystem now onto the regulatory front we expect a long overdue break in the log jam on outdated tv ownership rules this year under new fcc chairman ajit pai we see very positive signs of relief that will likely allow both vertical and horizontal consolidations of very good and overdue development for tegna and the industry overall and just last week the fcc gave approval to broadcasters to broadcast in our new atsc  standard which provides additional business opportunities down the road another good development for the industry and tegna and regarding the just concluded spectrum option as expected tegna did not sell any spectrum in the option now let me turn to political and quickly recap political in the fourth quarter we finished at  million higher than our previous guidance of  million to  million while we know presidential spending was down from prior elections notably senate spending was nearly flat and house races were up  and governor’s race is up  from  looking ahead to  the current political energy and activism that you’re all aware of alive in this country will likely result in heavy fund raising and political spending by midterm election standards so we expect a healthy year for political next year now let me turn to our many innovation initiatives that we’re using to reinvent our business innovations like hatch our centralized marketing solutions group combined with our new pricing and business intelligence team a comprehensive content innovation plan and premion our newly launched overthetop advertising services business are all positively impacting our clients and advancing the way we meet our consumers and customers needs premion has expanded its business and is ramping up very nicely local and regional advertisers recognize the importance of overthetop video content distribution and are taking nicely to premion’s position as a onestopshop in ott advertising in january alone we have  more campaigns than we did in december the interest from advertisers is real and it continues to grow each month these campaigns has spanned from  to  markets in other words we’re selling way outside our footprint and in the  tegna markets  properties have booked more than  total campaigns already in  and finally premion is also onboarding new distribution partners including turner firecom ph and major league baseball with these additions we now have more than  major content and broadcast partners who provide access to over  longform episodic branded networks hatch also is off to a strong start in  as a result of hatch creating unique multiplatform campaigns for local marketers we have  new accounts we didn’t have a year ago so the pipeline for potential business is strong and we’re optimistic on the prospect for developing new revenue throughout the year now to content to achieve ph the audience share increases and deeper engagement on all platforms that we’re getting we’re breaking our teams from the assembly line of formulaic local news production and investing in unique originable shareable content and pilots that will stand out amongst consumers we’ve introduced the concept to our teams brought in a lot of new innovative leaders to the company and we launched the first test in the marketplace on the air in november and evaluated our results despite competition from the world’s series strong competition and the election in november we saw share increases across  stations in the morning and  stations in late news and it’s important to know there’s often a  to month lag between audience share growth and revenue impacts on the programming side our commitment to having more control of our content within any programming that focuses on live and local is also producing results we currently have two local or regional pilots in production and now two national shows outtomarket for distribution tegna was a featured company earlier this year at the national association of television producers and executives also known as natpe our announcement of the show that gracia referenced a first of its kind daily live and online program has received great response we’re in the process of setting up stations now produced out of our denver affiliates with a low production costs this live show will be live across several time zones each weekday leveraging social media content and an entertaining ensemble cast to create a live experience unlike other syndicating shows on broadcast tv we have a partner in mgm studios under president mark burnett of the apprentice so those are just a few examples of the bold and aggressive moves tegna media is making our focus on innovation has become a competitive advantage and in  you can expect more in  we’ll be able to take these initiatives and leverage an incredible opportunity to showcase our content and revenue initiatives with the super bowl and the olympics on all our many nbc stations in next year’s first quarter with that i want to turn it over to my partner alex vetter at carscom alex vetter thank you dave for the fourth quarter of  we achieved  million in total revenue a  increase compared to the fourth quarter last year primarily due to continued growth in our retail channels retail revenue which includes our local dealer and national advertising businesses was up  yearoveryear with our revenue growth we achieved strong ebitda and ebitda margins which we believe are among the highest in the market our largest revenue gains were with auto manufacturers and major dealer chains where we saw  growth in the quarter compared to last year these customers have higher and larger resources and therefore are able to apply a more sophisticated approach to measuring marketing effectiveness further they are already focused on offline sales beyond digital generation of traditional leads our total wholesale revenue from affiliate newspapers and broadcasters was down  in the quarter versus last year we’re continuing to work with our affiliate partners to improve their performance and in certain cases restructure our relationships at the start of  we took control of certain territories from one affiliate partner an important first step in a transition that will provide carscom even greater opportunities to gain market share at the same time convert losses in our wholesale channel to retail revenue gains within our retail system on the local sales level with our broad network of dealers while we continue to take a leadership role in the industry providing value beyond traditional leads we are experiencing softer revenue as a reminder the fourth quarter is typically the slowest quarter for the company due to the seasonality of the automotive market the overall softness in local dealer business is primarily attributable to two factors traffic declines during the replatforming of the carscom technology and the shift of the consumer to mobile devices the replatforming of our carscom technology which is an important strategic initiative in  provides us with a much more flexible and robust technology infrastructure we’ve modernized our entire code base to allow us to develop products and features much faster for example our legacy platform we made two and a half changes per month on average with our new technology platform we’re now tracking towards more than  new innovative updates per month further as we discussed on the last earnings call our traffic and search engine position were negatively impacted during the replatforming work and as we said it will take us some time to regain our sar ph position which will in turn further increase the quality of traffic and leads we’re able to deliver to our local partners the good news is that i’m confident on the work we’re undertaking because part of that confidence is based on our shift to and strength in mobile our move to the responsive design allows consumers to experience our site regardless of the device they’re using our much improved site speed is also contributed to our growth in mobile with our fourth quarter mobile app traffic up  yearoveryear mobile users are more likely to be repeat visitors and our site data supports this we saw a  increase in our repeat visits compared to the same quarter last year and while mobile users are typically sending fewer leads to dealers the mobile user is typically much closer to a sale we’ve been tracking and analyzing mobile walkin behavior on the dealer lot for more than a year through our innovative lot insights reports which was the first of its kind for our industry and our reporting has revealed that when we factor in carscom mobile traffic we believe that we’re generating nearly  million more fiscal leads per year that are not consistently recognized within the industry further related to product innovation we continue to focus on improving the consumer experience with innovative app features such as price drop alerts onthelot vin scanning as well as urgency indicators on the site that provide realtime metrics on a given vehicle’s interest to shoppers we’re also encouraged by the early results from our acquisition of dealerrater which has positioned us as the largest automotive review platform in the industry last quarter we incorporated more than  million dealer reviews into the carscom web site and research shows that consumers trust reviews nearly as much as personal recommendations and we’ve emerged as the gotoresource for unbiased automotive opinions which we expect will translate into increased site traffic in addition dealerrater takes reviews one step further by allowing consumers to review individual employees within the dealership our data shows that nearly  of dealerrater sales people indicate their employee profiles help them sell more cars and drive more showroom visits we told you last quarter that we were awarded the jd power’s highest ranking for overall satisfaction among thirdparty automotive mobile web sites and the accolades keep coming for our work and our culture for the fourth consecutive year carscom was named the top review site and digital air strikes sixth annual automotive social media trends study we also received the highest rated used car advertising award in the eighth annual drivingsales dealer satisfaction awards now before i turn it over to victoria i’d like to make a few comments on our outlook we are expecting modest single digit total revenue growth in the first quarter we expect to see revenue growth in our national and major accounts businesses but at a lower rate than during the same quarter last year primarily related to reduction in spending at two national accounts due to a transition to an advertising agency and a change in placement strategy during the first quarter once these transitions are completed we expect these manufacturers to increase their spending as we progress throughout the year excluding the impact of these two accounts we expect our national and major accounts to be up in the  to  range in the quarter in line with the fourth quarter growth rate as i noted before while we’re taking steps to improve and in some cases restructure the relationships with our affiliates we expect a midsingle digit decline yearoveryear in this part of our business at the local sales level as we’ve discussed it will take time to grow our increase in seo traffic and the quality of traffic to our dealers and as that traffic grows we will be working to influence the industry to adopt new lead generation metrics that matter for today’s consumers namely the majority of those who made the shift to mobile on the industry front although analysts at this point in the year have mixed views on the sar auto sales are expected to remain at an alltime high and dealer profitability levels continue to be very strong thank you now i’ll turn it over to victoria for further comments victoria dux harker thanks alex and good morning everyone as gracia has already mentioned  was a solid year for tegna by almost every measure and we’re very pleased with our fourth quarter results reflected in doubledigit growth in both revenues and adjusted ebitda before we dive into our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter i’d like to highlight a few special items which unfavorably impacted operating expenses by about  million on a pretax basis with an associated eps impact of  per share these are primarily driven by noncash impairment charges and severance charges largely due to our recent reorganization at our go digital business beyond this we recognized about  million in nonoperating special items on a pretax basis with an associated unfavorable eps impact of  per share related to the anticipated carscom spinoff and the sale of additional business during the quarter we also report a special tax benefit resulting from deferred compensation investments with an eps benefit of  per share as gracia mentioned a conversion to a calendar year after the spinoff of republishing assets in  resulted in three fewer days in this year’s comparable fourth quarter results impacting the media segment revenue by about  million and adjusted ebitda by about  million despite this impact with solid performances by both media and digital segments we achieved earnings per share of  an increase of  over last year now turning to the fourth quarter consolidated financial results total company revenues of  million were up over  yearoveryear driven by a record media segment revenue and gains across our digital businesses during the quarter total company operating expenses of  million were  higher compared to last year driven by higher programming fees as well as expenses associated with solid revenue growth and ongoing investments in media segment initiatives these were partially offset by the absence of pointroll business on a comparative basis as a result of the solid operational execution across the segment tegna overall achieved strong adjusted ebitda of  million this quarter up  yearoveryear and our adjusted ebitda margin was  up  basis points compared to last year we’re also very pleased that the eps outperformance during the quarter was about half from the benefit of tax rate and half from operational performance now let’s turn to a more detailed review of the media and digital segment results media segment revenues of  million increased by  yearoveryear driven by strong retransmission revenue and higher political advertising spending as well as continued growth in digital revenue excluding the impact of the calendar change media segment revenue was up  in line with our guidance retransmission revenue was up  an anticipated growth rate lower than prior quarters due to lapping of the agreements negotiated during the fourth quarter of  for the year retransmission revenue was up significantly about  over last year beyond this media segment digital advertising revenues continued to increase up by about  driven by continued gains in digital marketing services and the success of our recently launched initiatives now focusing on first quarter  expectations based on current trends we anticipate total media segment revenue to be flat to slightly above the first quarter of last year the yearoveryear comparison will naturally be unfavorably impacted by about  million due to substantially lower political advertising revenue it’s also approximately  million less due to the move of the super bowl from our  cbs stations which reach about  million or nearly  of us households to our much smaller three fox stations footprint which reach only about  or one half of  of us households excluding the unfavorable impact of the super bowl shift and lower political advertising media segment revenues is expected to be up in the midsingle digits yearoveryear during the fourth quarter media segment operating expenses of  million were up  yearoveryear primarily due to increased programming fees excluding these fees media segment expenses increased approximately  driven by investments in our strategic initiatives including sales and content transformation projects during the quarter digital segment revenues of  million increased by  yearoveryear on a constant currency basis and adjusting for pointroll digital segment revenues were up by about  over last year reflecting higher revenue within carscom and careerbuilder carscom revenues increased by  during the fourth quarter reflecting increased market penetration in direct markets the recent dealerrater acquisition and strong national display advertising wholesale revenue was slightly down compared to last year with mixed performance by affiliates carscom revenues sold to the direct sales channels was up over  reflecting the factors alex mentioned earlier careerbuilder revenues were up by about  yearoveryear on a constant currency basis with significant improvement sequentially growth was mainly due to higher resume data base revenue continued sales momentum of softwareasaservice solution and several recent acquisitions partially offset by continued headwinds in the job posting business digital segment operating expenses of  million were up  reflecting investments in growth initiatives and the expenses allocated with the newly acquired businesses within both carscom and careerbuilder partially offset by the absence of expenses at pointroll now turning to capex capital investments of  million during the quarter reflects our ongoing commitment to reinvest in business priorities and digital development as well as media content product integration and platform enhancements for the year our capital investments totaled  million just slightly above our full year target due to additional investments in software development turning now to capital allocation after a brief pause in the share repurchase program following the announcement of the intended carscom spinoff we resumed the repurchases on a limited basis in november since the reactivation approximately  million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at an average price per share of  for a total of  million at the end of the quarter our longterm debt stood at  billion reflecting the extinguishment of  million in  senior notes which reached their maturity earlier in  beyond this in november we accelerated the redemption of the outstanding  million remaining on our  notes at par which were due to mature in september of  as we mentioned during our previous call both these actions will result in significant interest expense savings of  million annually approximately  million over two years respectively at the end of the quarter cash on the balance sheet was  million and free cash flow for the quarter was  million with that we will now open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we’ll take our first question from barton crockett with fbr capital markets barton crockett okay great thanks for taking the question and i appreciate some of your thoughts about the regulatory situation under the new fcc leadership but i was wondering if you could expand a little bit on that i think you said that you see opportunities for more horizontal and vertical combinations i was wondering if you could be a little bit more specific about what the constraints are that you think could be changed in how tegna will try and be positioned for that david t lougee sure this is dave i’ll take that just starting with the vertical there’s been a longstanding uhf discount for stations that’s been frozen effectively recently and we expect that to be reinstated probably within the next couple of months as the fcc appropriately is looking at that they should view it holistically with all the ownership rules and then as or even more importantly i think possibly by as early as the end of the summer or early in the fall the fcc under new fcc chairman ajit pai who’s been very public in the past about the need for these outdated rules to be updated we expect him to take action he does not need to do for those of you familiar with the socalled quadrennial review that the fcc is supposed to do every four years while the next one is scheduled for  he’s already got a petition for reconsideration in front of him of the last ones that the previous fcc did so all the filings have been done the process is fairly simple and clean for him to reinstate them – to relax them and specifically what we mean by those inmarket rules are there’s a number of old rules that really limit our ability to consolidate in the marketplaces specifically i’ll call out probably the two most important which is there’s an eightvoices test where you have to have eight independent owners in a market again from a buy point here ph and two that you can’t own two of the big four stations in a marketplace as determined by ratings technically and that made sense once upon a time obviously when broadcasting before the internet was here before video was here before cable had grown but i think the time has come and he’s got control of the commission and we have a pretty high level of confidence that those rules will change we’ll also need for the department of justice to take a look at how they have viewed inmarket advertising in those markets there’s some guidelines there that sort of date back to a previous definition of the market again before at least all these new entrance that i referenced so in a nutshell that piece of it the ability to consolidate horizontally in a market is a very good development for the industry and for us specifically as well barton crockett okay that’s helpful just to try and understand a little bit more clearly do you expect – what constraints would you expect us to end up with when this process is done do you think we’d be able to combine two or three of the top four stations in a market where do you think the puck’s going and would you guys be a buyer or a seller or both in such a situation david t lougee i think it’s very likely that two big four stations will be – that one owner will be allowed to own two big four stations finally gracia c martore barton i think as you have always known about us we are incredibly opportunistic people we will look at all the opportunities that come up i think there’s room for as dave was trying to allude to both outright ma activity and then i think there’s other opportunities to look at portfolio optimizations where you might want to swap to better everybody’s portfolio concentration assuming as dave says that the inmarket duopoly rules get relaxed so i think that we’re blessed with the fact that we have a strong balance sheet we generated an enormous amount of free cash flow and that we have the opportunity to be active across all alternatives barton crockett okay and then if i could switch gears with one other question in your first quarter  outlook for flat to little bit of growth maybe in the media segment granted there’s political and super bowl headwinds but you also have retrans growth what is the implied trend in core advertising it looks like you’re seeing maybe a high single digit decline there i was wondering if you could comment on that and when you talked about the  growth in retrans do we see that in the first quarter or does it kind of ramp up a little bit later david t lougee so the midsingle digits guidance is allin and we do see retrans that number rolling through the year because those were deals that were done at the end of the year as core has been slow starting off in the marketplace as i’m sure you’ve heard from others as well and it’s been ramping throughout the quarter but we do obviously have the headwinds of almost  million last year in the super bowl so it won’t end up up for us but it is improving barton crockett okay i’ll leave it there thanks a lot guys gracia c martore to be more specific barton i do not believe that we are in anyway anticipating excluding super bowl that our core numbers would be down in the high single digits that’s not the expectation at all barton crockett okay all right gracia c martore but the expectation would be that they would be better than that just to be clear barton crockett okay i appreciate that i’ll walk through the math offline with you guys but i appreciate that clarification thanks operator we’ll take our next question from alexia quadrani with jpmorgan alexia quadrani hi thank you just a quick follow up first for my first question dave i think when you just said it won’t end up up for us when you were talking about the core advertising you meant i think in the first quarter right because for the full year you are looking for improvement in core advertising as the year progresses is that correct david t lougee that’s right about the first quarter we haven’t changed any it’s very early and money’s been indiscernible so we’ve got no information to change any thinking around the year alexia quadrani okay and then just want to follow up on your previous comments also about the virtual mvpds that you were talking about any more color you can give us on how those relationships go i know you don’t obviously want to talk about any specific contract but just sort of in general are the deals similar in nature to traditional deals when you talk about how it’s sort of net neutral from a subscriber whether they’re on linear or they’re on virtual mvpd could you also give us more color are they multiyear deals do they have escalators i guess how are they generally set up thank you david t lougee sure alexia i’m glad to there’s no one clear model that – there’s several different forms of which the deals are coming down and being negotiated for instance i think it’s worthwhile dividing between new entrants and traditional mvpds or getting into this space like dish and direct got well publicized services out there so the negotiations on the economics around those dish and direct deals are integrated into the affiliate negotiation types of – to the retrans negotiations that we have with those providers so we’re ending up with almost duplicative economics – i should say almost duplicative economics on those deals as it relates to the new entrants the form of payment and the structure may look different than what we do with traditional retrans but the net retrans per subscriber is going to be ending up the same so there’s no onestop shopping on the way the deals are being constructed but in the end they are all like we said earlier broadcasting is at the core of each of these services what they have to have to get off the ground and the consumers have voted loudly that they want us so that bodes very well for our near and longterm economics in that space alexia quadrani okay thank you very much operator we’ll take our next question from douglas arthur with huber research douglas arthur yes two questions dave in terms of the progress you’ve made on closing the gap on reverse retrans do you sort of foresee any phasing of that throughout the year or just somewhere to alexia’s question on retrans or fairly smooth progression and then i’ve got a follow up david t lougee no the former is the right answer we will be ramping throughout the year we’ve modeled that we’ll be doing  douglas arthur on initiatives  david t lougee yes on the initiatives that we have that they ramp throughout the year and that the cover on the gap which we’ll more than do is for the full year douglas arthur okay great and then a follow up on the  growth constant currency careerbuilder aurico workterra how much did they add to that growth and what’s sort of the pro forma organic growth for careerbuilder gracia c martore doug as you can appreciate we are in the middle of looking at some strategic alternatives so i have to be a little bit careful but what i would say to you is that every category of revenue grew at careerbuilder other than jobs board which we indicated in the past have seen price compression with respect to some of the growth that we’re seeing from those acquisitions that’s actually some growth that we look at it as a product adding the ability to do prehire testing and confirmation of employment and the like is a product that we were going to probably get into this just helped us to accelerate that process but what i can tell you is we saw growth across everything other than the jobs board piece of it and saw absolute growth victoria dux harker doug this is victoria just to expand on this as we talked about in previous calls a number of these opportunities in terms of products are now being sold across the sales forces so they become an integrated part of the solution so it’s not a direct sale from a previous company that we acquired it’s much more integrated than that douglas arthur okay great thank you operator next we’ll go to kyle evans with stephens kyle evans hi thanks alex could you talk a little bit more about the affiliations and where you took over direct sales were those markets given back to you by choice did you take them as a part of the contracts just a little bit more color there would be appreciated alex vetter sure we’re in close conversations with all of our channel partners and we’ve spent more time with the partners that have had the worst performance yearoveryear because we’re seeing many markets improve their performance yearoveryear so we’re working from the bottom up and in those discussions we identified several territories where they just didn’t have the sales pressure that we felt that we could provide in the market and they agreed to relinquish those territories to us so it wasn’t a fullon takeover of an entire channel partner but rather them relinquishing a handful of markets and territories and we’re going to continue kyle to keep the pressure on our affiliate partners and if they’re unable to generate the results we’re having active discussions about us stepping in and taking over gar i think kyle just to add to what alex is saying we are looking at all the alternatives as alex has indicated to the extent that the affiliate performance particularly in a one affiliate or two affiliates worsens then obviously we’re going to be talking to them before they get to that point where we’re going to take away the markets and see if there’s some logical conclusion we can come to that one benefits them but two benefits us and gets us control of those markets so there’s a number of things going on that we really can’t comment on specifically but rest assured that we are not sitting by and not taking actions in a variety of different ways kyle evans without going into specifics how fast can you run that process the affiliates were positive last quarter third quarter negative when could we expect to see more consistent growth there alex vetter i would say that all the channel partners have expressed an intent to grow this year and given us plans that show that how they’re going to attain it we’re backing their plans and in the event that they’re failing to achieve them that’s when we’re immediately engaging with them i think the good news is over  and  we’ve got far more channel partners more engaged this year than we had in the past as they see the growth opportunity in front of them gracia c martore yes and i think this is the year where we’re going to be having those more creative conversations because if this year you don’t see that kind of improvement in  and  which is when they come up then the results will be inevitable kyle evans right a question for dave could you give us an update on your subscriber account for retransmission in the quarter david t lougee yes we’re relatively stable we’ve just saw very mild declines consistent with other quarters that’s really specific to one provider so we’re feeling  gracia c martore ma activity  david t lougee yes due to some ma activity in the sector so we continue to see them being relatively stable we’ll once again call out when you see public reports individual cable networks are seeing some significant gaps but that’s different than what’s happening with the overall mvpd subs and as i mentioned before too ott is over time going to become replacement and possibly even additive kyle evans okay lastly you raised your retrans guide congrats on better than expected there the last thing we got from you on  media was for low singles to mid singles growth still no change to that for the full year for media gracia c martore yes i think again what we would say kyle is that it’s incredibly early in the year as dave said the year – i think universally across the broadcast group you’ve heard folks talking about the fact that the year got off to a much slower start than anticipated in part i think we all should have gone back and looked at what happened after presidential election years and would have seen that there’s not – there’s some pattern to that this year is going to be an interesting year because when you think about some of the actions that could happen around the economy this year around taxes around other things this year could go in a variety of different ways and if you saw tax relief for the middle class actually happening this year et cetera that could be a positive so this is one of those unusual years where there’s a lot of things at play and we’re just going to have to see how it all unfolds during the course of the year kyle evans thank you operator we’ll take our next question from marci ryvicker with wells fargo marci ryvicker hi david just want to clarify something you talked about that retrans gap going from  million to  million to  million to  million is it based on your negotiations in a rate and from initiatives or just initiatives david t lougee no initiatives have nothing to do with retrans marci it’s just that the actual gap between what we pay out networks right that we were going to have this year with retrans because of the nbc hit that’s the gap and it went down simply because of the retrans revenue growth marci ryvicker okay and then in terms of the initiatives is there any way to think about it in terms of leaving this into our models as the year progresses at incremental i think  million to  million that you talked about david t lougee yes i think that’s a good way to think about i think we’re on track to do that what pockets the revenue will come in will probably change a little bit through the course of the year as more of it will move to digital but probably about a half of that is in core and about a third in core and digital and other allin for the year but the mix will change and it will be at a margin consistent with the rest of our business marci ryvicker okay and then one last one and i apologize if i missed it for carscom did you talk about the contribution from dealerrater i guess a gracia ph question gracia c martore no we didn’t talk about it because frankly we see that literally as a product we had already at cars amassed some number of reviews it was a business that we wanted to get into we basically bought them and got access to  million reviews then what we did is we have a sales force which they did not have we’re bringing the sale force to bear and that’s something that will ramp up during the course of  so the contribution is modest but really it’s a product extension as we see it rather than an ma actively marci ryvicker got it thank you very much gracia c martore thank you marci operator our next question comes from dan kurnos with the benchmark co dan kurnos great thanks good morning just quickly dave i guess kind of housekeeping as other people have kind of talked about this i know you gave a little bit of color around the extra days but if you pull out political views give us a sense of what q core was expolitical ph it looks like there was a little bit of upside and just any incremental color beyond auto on categories in case i missed it david t lougee for the fourth quarter core excluding the four days was down high single digits but as far as categories go auto was strong it came back in march after the crowd out in november and on the flipside of that media and telecom down a little bit dan kurnos great and then just for alex just a couple of high level thoughts for you as you sort of prepare life after tegna i guess just can you talk about sort of the influence and the shifting spend from the oems back and forth between digital and broadcast and that’s growing to the dealer level sort of the impacts between the mix shift we’re seeing in cars between new and shifting more towards used and then any comments you could have on sort of service usage on mobile versus desktop thanks alex vetter sure first of all i don’t have the media allocation numbers in front of me but manufacturers have been aggressively shifting their dollars towards digital over the past few years and importantly with a flattening new car sales year or sar predicted for  i think you’re seeing manufacturers increase their focus on inmarket sites where they can capture incrementality and retention marketing is probably the biggest term we’re hearing in  from manufacturers as they really seek to hold on to their existing sales and try to take share from their competitors and so platforms like ours are highly captive  of our audience intends to buy a car within a very near window so manufacturers can really use that consumer indifference to their advantage and so we continue to see manufacturers as i mentioned if you back out the two accounts that had an agency changeover and a switch in their buying process our manufacturer spending would have been up in doubledigit growth and we see those two manufacturers have already started to reengage in their first quarter spending so we expect that process to work its way out i think on your next question was about new and used trends while new is projected to be flat to down for  the used car market is extremely strong and healthy and growing and about  of our total site traffic comes in looking for a used car and while we see our users vacillate back and forth between new and used we’ve got a massive data base of used vehicles in our data base over nearly almost  million used car listings in our data base so we’re seeing strong growth in the used car market for  and then the last question i want to make sure i understand it your question was about service usage on devices dan kurnos yes i just want to kind of get a sense – look obviously you’re getting more traffic through mobile you’ve gone through the replatforming now you added a lot of ancillary service offerings so i’m just curious sort of any learnings you have so far on customer usage of services on mobile versus sort of traditional desktop alex vetter sure first of all at a macro level we know intent to buy increases as people move to mobile devices our overall business has a sixmonth purchase horizon for buying a car if you isolate purchase intent just to mobile devices the purchase horizon shortens to nearly  days so we think as manufacturers and dealers come to realize that mobile is the last word in deciding what and where to buy they’re going to just start increasing their investment in mobile much like they first started increasing their investment in digital several years back and so there’s a learning curve there for the auto industry on how they can use mobile there’s obviously less room for display advertising and they have to think a little bit more creatively about how they market on mobile devices but in  mobile now accounts for over half of our total site traffic and we don’t ever see a day coming back where the balance will shift back the other way it’s only going to grow in importance in  and beyond and marketers we think if you follow the narratives and all industries are viewing mobile as the next battlefield for their marketing dollars dan kurnos that’s really helpful i guess i will also ask a little bit more on the addons like mechanics that kind of stuff actually service of the car do you see more people use mobile for that purpose or are you seeing the same kind of dynamics alex vetter well we are seeing an increase in usage in our mobile devices on dealership lots and so yes pricing validation selection validation a lot of our mobile usage is happening on dealer lots and i’d be happy to follow up with you offline and get you some more detailed statistics on usage patterns dan kurnos all right that sounds good alex thanks for all the color i appreciate it guys gracia c martore great we’ve got time for just one more quick question operator jim goss with barrington research please go ahead james goss thanks i wanted to ask about the extent of your program development the bold deal with mgm where you’re going to be producing and they’re going to be distributing i wondered if you might talk about a little bit more about what that’s going to entail you say it’s a multiplatform type of venture will mgm be your primary partner or only partner going forward or is this one of many partners you envision as you sort of ramp up this sort of business and maybe related can you talk a little about the timing of cost recognition and the revenue potential or will this be more of an equity line item david t lougee so on the partnership question first jim let me say that we do plan to do business in the programming space with lots of folks mgm is a good partner but we don’t intend to be exclusive as nor they i think you’ll us partnering with other station groups as well from a timing standpoint i’ve been talking more about your first question about the nature of the show what’s going to be unique about it is it is going to be live so if you got a timeslot at  o’clock eastern or you’ve got a timeslot at  am pacific time and you’re on the west coast we will – based on the demand from stations we will be producing multiple half hour increments so that people will have live on the air we think the data show us that live is becoming increasingly important in linear viewing and we say online it’s also we can be an ott product social and digital will drive the content because it’s live we’re not constrained by nontopicality of things being four or five hours old or having to be produced a day in advance and pumped out by satellite in the morning so trending items i’d say like the oscars last night and how people are responding to that thing will be embedded into the content of the show in real time and we will be in turn – the producers of the show will be doing content to engage with the viewers on their own mobile devices while they’re watching the show gracia c martore on your accounting question jim it’s still a little early on bold we’re going to have to see who gets added to the mix et cetera to see whether it will be more on the equity side operating nonoperating equity investment so we’ll keep you posted on that as we get – we’re really in the nascent stages of it we introduced it we now are looking at other opportunities and as soon as we’ve got that all figured out we will share with you what the appropriate treatment will be james goss and if i could squeeze in one more thought the atsc  impact i think it will relate to digital elements of the broadcasting business does this tie into the whole concept of bold david t lougee jim not specifically i think that atsc will provide the opportunity for onetoone broadcasting and advertising and will be ip compatible with other wireless services so there’s a number of direct businesses that could come out of it but the time horizon we’re launching bold here in the fall and the business opportunities with  are a few years away so it’s not to say there won’t be some potentially innovative interactions between the technology and content but no it’s not the – bold itself is not setup as a  in this year gracia c martore thanks jim for your questions james goss thank you gracia c martore we really appreciate you joining us this morning we are

and ceo gracia martore our cfo victoria harker and members of our leadership team will review tegnas fourth quarter and yearend  results after their commentary well open up the call for questions hopefully youve had the opportunity to review this mornings press release if you have not yet reviewed a copy of the release its available at tegnacom before we get started id like to remind you that this conference call and webcast include forwardlooking statements and our actual results may differ factors that might cause them to differ are outlined in our sec filings this presentation also includes certain nongaap financial measures we have provided reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures in the press release and on the investor relations portion of our website with that let me turn the call over to gracia gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer thanks jeff good morning everyone and let me add my welcome to our call this morning im going to provide some highlights on our overall performance in each of our businesses and then ill be turning it over to our business heads dave lougee president of tegna media alex vetter ceo of carscom and matt ferguson ceo of careerbuilder theyll do a deep dive on each of their respective areas and then victoria will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter at the end so lets get right into it our progress in our first six months as a highly focused media and digital company has been very strong when we made the decision to separate our businesses into two we had a very specific vision in mind for tegna and when we held our investor day in june we were confident in the expectations and projects we laid out for you but we know that for all of you confidence does not necessarily equate to absolute certainty but in just six short months we have removed a great deal of those uncertainties including those around our affiliation agreements and retransmission fees and replaced them with certainties for years to come we have even more confidence that we have built a strong foundation that will enable us to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand in the industries we serve a foundation that best leverages our unique mix of advantages including topperforming assets scale and partnerships which give us the tremendous negotiating platform youve seen over the last several months high margins and consistently strong and dependable cash flows experienced industry experts running each of our businesses and a shareholderfocused capital structure now weve leveraged those strengths to create a strong platform that can and will support our growth throughout  and beyond so lets turn to fourth quarter results companywide as you saw our revenue totaled about  million now there were lots of ins and outs as you probably saw in the press release tegna media had to overcome a record level of  million of political revenue in the fourth quarter last year which masked otherwise strong results doubledigit increases in retransmission and online revenues and higher core advertising when you exclude that impact of the unfavorable political spending comparison tegna media revenues would have been up  now our digital segment revenue was impacted by the sale of our pointroll business which we completed in november and as you can see on page four of our press release this morning we show that excluding pointroll from both the  and  fourth quarter periods and adjusting for exchange rates  so on a pro forma constantcurrency basis  digital segment revenues were over  higher new product launches and revenue growth at carscom higher revenue per dealer at carscom was offset by a revenue decline at careerbuilder as it continues its transition towards higher margin softwareasaservice solutions and builds a leadership position in that space as you probably saw expenses in the quarter were down over  on a nongaap basis now youve heard me say it quarter after quarter but i think it bears repeating our disciplined and prudent approach to managing expenses and ensuring we are optimizing the efficiency of our operations while investing fully in our future will continue to be an important tenet of our strategy while we successfully grow our businesses equally important ebitda was strong and our ebitda margin of  was comparable to the fourth quarter of last year despite the absence of substantial highermargin political spending another important pillar of our strategy is a commitment to a shareholder friendly capital allocation structure as you saw in october we announced a  million increase in our share repurchase program bringing it up to  million which will be used over the original threeyear term ending in june of  the increase reflects a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters which enabled us to increase the return of cash to our shareholders while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction as weve noted before we have more than ample financial flexibility to pay our dividend repurchase shares based on business conditions and new opportunities reduce debt and invest in our businesses now id like to switch gears for a moment and provide you with a handful of highlights on each of our businesses before turning it over to dave alex and matt as you saw tegna media achieved revenues in line with our previous guidance driven by as i noted core advertising revenue growth doubledigit digital revenue growth and very strong retransmission revenue due in part to our recently completed agreements additionally i would be remiss not to mention that tegna media was named station group of the year for  by broadcasting  cable based on our outstanding group of local television stations that have fantastic reporting leading ratings and financial results and an innovative strategic approach we are very proud of our team and i want to congratulate dave and his entire team on this welldeserved honor and a very strong year  is looking to be even more promising for a number of reasons first the outcomes of all of our recent network affiliation agreements and several carriage agreements have been consistent with and in some cases exceeded the longterm projections we outlined at our investor day in june not only are our successful negotiations are testament to the high demand for the engaging content we provide more importantly they replace the uncertainty around tegna media that may have existed several months ago with absolute longerterm certainty as you saw in january we reached an agreement with nbc of which we are the largest independent affiliate group we are thrilled that we are set to deliver nbcs outstanding content from sports to news to primetime for years to come we also in the quarter secured multiyear agreements for continued carriage of tegna media television stations on directv and att uverse and dish network at more appropriately favorable rates and as you know this summer we announced the renewal of our agreements with cbs for ten tegna media markets nationwide tegna will participate in the cbs allaccess video ondemand service and we believe that partnering with cbs on both of these fronts ensures that tegna audiences have access to mustsee content on all their devices now our rising retransmission revenues and successful negotiations are driven by our track record for delivering bestinclass content as a result weve gone one step further and have successfully entered the content creation arena with the td jakes show we took a terrific personality created and produced a talk show around him and aired it on four of our local stations daves going to provide some additional details but from my perspective this is a testament to our ability to deliver homegrown content which further diversifies our business and ensures an ongoing stream of quality programming for our audiences yet another reason we are very optimistic about  is our outstanding positioning for the upcoming presidential election as well as the summer olympics which will air on nbc tegna is very wellpositioned in the key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward as dave will highlight we will have a tremendous platform and set of stations in this election we of course expect a significantly more substantial impact in  and are looking forward to a recordbreaking year turning now to carscom we continued to see strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter we fully expect this positive growth trajectory to continue and were looking ahead to a strong  we anticipate revenue growth of plus for the full year through new product development and continued innovation in fact we introduced five new products over the course of  each of which continues to show strong returns alex will provide further details on our new products and other strategic initiatives in just a few moments moving to careerbuilder  as weve said represented a transformative year we launched the worlds first and only prehire platform and new recruitment software products shifting a majority of our business toward higher growth stickier higher margin solutions we also unveiled an exciting new look and feel for our brand that aligns with our new softwareasaservice focus strategy careerbuilder is fast becoming a leading global hr softwareasaservice company with a presence in more than  markets worldwide a move that complements and enhances its successful job board business matt is going to provide you with an update on ongoing transition in just a few moments but now let me turn it over to dave lougee for his comments on tegna media dave david t lougee  presidenttegna media thanks gracia let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that gracia referenced we finished  by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners specifically we successfully negotiated retransmission consent agreements covering  of our distributors paying subscribers we also reached a longterm agreement with our largest network partner nbc and earlier had reached an agreement with cbs both network deals trueup all the tegna stations and former belo stations under single coterminus contracts in the case of cbs you may recall that the belo stations agreement went until the beginning of  and thatll continue to operate this year  under the same financial terms of the previous agreement in the case of nbc its the inverse of cbs the original tegna stations agreement didnt expire until january of  and that contract did not include reverse comp so even under our new agreement those original tegna stations will not begin paying reverse comp until january of next year while the former belo stations under nbc which were already paying reverse comp under their previous nbc agreement now fall under the financial terms of the new agreement so the net of all these deals is this between our nbc and cbs deals this year and our abc agreement the year before the reverse comp part of our equation is set for years to come with our largest partner nbc going out to early  that combined with the  of our subs renewed  of which go out to late  means that we have as gracia said certainty and stability around the retransmission piece of our business for the long term and in line with our overall model outlined at investor day last summer at the time of our company split and a final word on retrans as ive said before our trends on subscriber numbers look materially different than most if not all cable channels and thats for two important reasons one given the geographic nature of our portfolio following the belo acquisition were adding homes through population growth but the second dynamic is the fact that there appears to be far more cord shavers than cord cutters mvpds are moving many of their video subscribers to basic tier packages that only include broadcasters and that has some very key potential longterm implications in ad dollar allocations as there will be a growing gap in the size of distribution for us versus cable channels now lets turn to  and other topics and ill start with political as gracia referenced our footprint for the primaries like the later general election is superb specifically between now and march  we have presidential primaries in  of our  markets our total spending of course is hard to predict as anything with this election is hard to predict as you know but we know it will end up at record levels for the primary season between political net retrans the olympics and digital sales growth tegna media will have a record year further driving our growth in  is a series of key initiatives were investing in that leverage the scale weve been able to achieve first content innovation were taking a development mindset to our core news product we have eight pilots in production that are not married to traditional news formats for example kare  in minneapolis just recently launched our first pilot breaking the news and we launched that in january in its first three weeks its already the number one new show in its time period second sales transformation through centralized worldclass pricing and sophisticated marketing capabilities were putting the right tools and the right pitches in the hands of our local clients in the fourth quarter we completed the staffing of our centralized sales marketing team called hatch with hatch were leveraging our local relationships across all our markets to sell larger marketingbased solutions that go well beyond traditional tv ad dollars we estimate that for every dollar in advertising in our local markets there  in marketing in addition our new inhouse business intelligence team is ramping up quickly building a proprietary pricing platform to increase the yield and value of tegna medias inventory together we expect the hatch and proprietary pricing initiatives to generate about  million to  million of incremental ebitda this year and as i outlined last summer at investor day these initiatives will accelerate in  and  and will be accompanied by significant ebitda growth from other core and adjacent initiatives underway now lets turn to the original program gracia referenced tegna media is the first broadcaster to own  of a syndicated daytime property td jakes beyond the  tegna media markets well initially launch in weve signed an additional  markets and the number continues to grow between facebook and twitter td jakes has a loyal social following of more than  million people which we will be leveraging for both show content and promotion and social media is now at the core of all we do and in fact in  we in the aggregate were one of facebooks top five largest media players generating more engagement than national players like cnn and new york times in fact kusa our denver station had the number one facebook post at any local news organization in  a post that generated more than  million interactions and on the monetization side our success in digital content creation offers us new opportunities with offplatform publishers weve agreed with facebook to be one of the first local broadcasters to participate in their instant articles beta program and were engaging in offplatform publishing conversation with many others as well and with that let me turn it over to matt from careerbuilder matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc thanks dave  will be an exciting year for careerbuilder in addition to rolling out new software solutions were elevating our brand visibility through highprofile sponsorships like the careerbuilder challenge pga tournament tv advertising and community outreach were excited about the launch of findyourcallingcom as we know students today graduate with more than  in debt careerbuilder created a free site that enable students to view easytouse realtime labor market data for any occupation that matches their interests from job growth projections salary ranges and businesses that are hiring to programs that they can apply to today were partnering with high schools around the country to help students make better decisions about majors degrees in school so that they have the outcomes they want once they enter the labor force were also helping to reskilling up skilled workers of all ages so we can raise income levels of individuals families and communities and help close the skills gap in the united states we recently announced a partnership with capella university that will enable workers to develop skills in indemand fields in less than three months at little cost through intensive online training were helping workers develop st century skills for st century jobs such as web development and information security and believe this will have a lasting impact on the labor market overall we expect our revenue growth in  to be in the midsingle digits and reach double digits by the end of  as gracia said  was a transitional year for us as we made calculated strategic moves to facilitate more robust revenue growth in the future we generated just under  million in revenue which was essentially flat yearoveryear when you exclude the impact of currency did this as we moved away from some lowmargin transactional revenue and focused on higher margin platform solutions ill give you an example of one of those that i discussed in the last earnings call we saw yearoveryear decline of  million in revenue or  percentage points in  in our employer services unit we moved from a transactional offering for sourcing and screening candidates to platformbased one that has longer commitments and builtin software our platform source and screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months and we have enough book business to estimate that march revenue will be up yearoveryear around  based on this trend we believe were on track to grow  million in this business line in  or about  percentage point as we had projected earlier in  we also were impacted by moving several thousand low margin transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts it was disruptive for some clients and others were no longer a fit fortunately since that move the business is flat sequentially rather than declining but its still weighing on  results if you remove that currency impact the source and screen revenue i discussed earlier and the low margin transactional accounts we moved to that specialized group our business was actually up  yearoveryear in  overall we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in  however we included that pricing pressure in our projections we have a lot of opportunities to go after more job volume though the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled jobs moreover weve seen good growth in our software solutions and our résumé database in  and we expect that to continue we believe we are through most of the transition are set up for growth again in the coming year with a more seasoned sales force well also continue to pursue key acquisitions and roll out new software products we believe we will see doubledigit growth in our saasbased products in  as our software solutions line résumé database and employer services which will lead to revenue growth in the midsingle digits in  and  growth by the end of  were excited about the opportunities ahead as we break new ground in the industry and at this point id like to turn it over to alex vetter from cars alex vetter  president  chief executive officer carscom llc thank you matt were very pleased to close out  on such a strong footing the strong growth has primarily been driven by increased dealer market penetration new products and increased purchase of display advertising we achieved solid growth in q as our direct sales and major account teams did a great job throughout the quarter growing revenues by  national revenues were also equally strong up  as gracia mentioned our robust product pipeline yielded five new products in  delivering customer value and generating revenues as you know the total addressable market for service and repair digital advertising for franchise dealers is fairly large and generally unaddressed estimated to about  million and our entry into this area with repairpal certified continues to show strong returns event positions another one of our  innovations is a new opportunity with an emphasis on mobile that provides customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a sevenday period this product has far exceeded our expectations outperforming projected revenue by  in the second half of  this is evidence that carscom is delivering solutions that meet our customers needs looking ahead our sell and trade solutions allow us to help consumers sell their vehicles quickly and help dealers acquire inventory they were tested largely in the fourth quarter and based on strong test results a national launch is scheduled for the first quarter of  with a total addressable market of about  million at the same time weve continued to move to a more responsive design on our website which ultimately provides a more consistent user experience for consumers across all device types as part of our multifaceted digital advertising strategy our carscom onthelot report continues to help quantify the influence that were having on walkin shoppers by using geofence technology to move beyond basic lead generation measurement and through our ad modernization efforts additional advertising units will be available on the carscom mobile properties this is designed to capture new revenues as consumers continue to migrate to the use of mobile devices weve achieved several major accomplishments at this years north american international auto show in detroit where we hosted our annual best of award show for manufacturers and other automotive businesses selected by the companys editorial experts these awards are designed to help shoppers across a variety of segments and budgets choose the best vehicle for their needs award categories include the best of  best pickup truck for  ecofriendly car of the year the family car of the year the luxury car of the year and the play car of the year this show is now on its sixth year and the best of awards has been one of the most talkedabout events during the detroit auto show drawing an audience of over  attendees this year we hosted ceos from bmw and volvo as well as dozens of csuite executives from other car companies and related businesses in addition too our editorial team covered the auto show in full force and published  articles and  videos highlighting the biggest news from the press days our coverage of the auto show didnt stop there we unveiled a brandnew online video series called car kids which features two very young reporters hitting the show floor to offer their take on the hottest cars through humorfilled clips and interviews with manufacturer executives most importantly the auto show provides us an opportunity to connect directly with oems and in doing so were able to discuss some of the macro trends expanded diversified revenue stream and new partnerships opportunities we gained valuable insights on the industry and with a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of vehicles growing tier  oem budgets have increased weve added coverage from both the sales and support level to help capture these regional dealer association advertising dollars across the country with targeted messaging becoming much easier to execute our platforms become a great place to get regionally focused offers and messaging to consumers in the lines of these advertisements as manufacturers and agencies began to build teams to analyze the vast amount of data being captured in real time were having important conversations about the ways in which data with its incredibly valuable intent signals can become productized manufacturers and their agencies are looking for more streamlined access to content and data and if we can provide it to them we have a winwin opportunity where we can bolster brands and bolster the carscom brand in the process as you can see we have several reasons to be optimistic about  and our new products continue to gain traction and our pipeline of innovative ideas continues to grow as previously discussed we expect to deliver revenue growth of  or more in  through new product development and continued innovation while growth may not be evenly dispersed from quartertoquarter were confident in our projections to remain on target with that let me turn it over to victoria for a detailed financial review victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president thanks alex and good morning everyone as gracia has already mentioned  was a monumental year for tegna the strength of our businesses during the fourth quarter give us great confidence for  and beyond were very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results despite being up against challenging yearoveryear comparisons due to the absence of significant political advertise spending that benefited us during the fourth quarter of  before i review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter id like to highlight several special items which totaled  million during the fourth quarter of  with gaap eps benefit of  per share primarily related to a gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters building offset in part by workforce restructuring facility consolidation and impairment charges now lets briefly review the operating results for the quarter as a reminder although ill be focusing on our nongaap performance results today you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release also as we mentioned during the last earnings call we converted to a calendar year after the spin of our publishing assets in june as a result the fourth quarter results include the impact an additional four days contributing about  million to media segment revenues with an eps benefit of about  during the quarter with solid performances by both digital and media segments we achieved earnings per share of  yearoveryear earnings per share were up  driven by organic growth at carscom and despite the challenging yearoveryear political comparison in tegna media total company revenues of  million were down  yearoveryear but its important to note that excluding the impact of record nonpresidential political advertising revenue during the prior year total revenues were in fact up  driven by continued growth in retransmission as well as higher digital and core revenues within the media segment as well as strong carscom revenues during the quarter total company operating expenses of  million were lower by  over last year mainly due to seasonally lower quarter – fourth quarter marketing cost at carscom and direct cost reductions at careerbuilder as well as the absence of publishing back officerelated stranded cost which impacted expenses during the fourth quarter of last year now lets turn to a more detailed review of media and digital segments results as we previously noted largely due to absence of record nonpresidential political revenues of over  million in the fourth quarter of  tegna media revenues of  million declined by  yearoveryear in line with our previous comments on our last call however excluding the impacts of political advertising compared to the fourth quarter last year media segment revenues would have been up by about  retransmission fees boosted by retransmission agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and annual rate increases were up  to a historical high of  million during the fourth quarter beyond this tegna media digital advertising revenues were also up  driven by digital marketing services which continue to gain traction across all our television stations driven by geodigital sales extended reach networks and national digital revenues core advertising was also up by about  in part due to the impact of political displacement last year our strongest revenue categories for fourth quarter included auto professional services entertainment medical services and home improvement now focusing on q  projections based on current trends we expect that growth in media segments revenues for the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  to be in the range of  to  driven by increases in political advertising retransmission revenue and digital revenue core advertising is expected to be about the same as the first quarter last year primarily due to the unfavorable impact of super bowl advertising which aired on our  cbs stations in  versus our  nbc stations in  excluding the impacts of the super bowl the percentage growth in core advertising is expected to be up in the lowsingle digits during the fourth quarter the media segments operating expenses were up  yearoveryear due to increased programming costs investment in our digital sales initiatives including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings during the quarter digital segment revenue on a proforma basis excluding the impacts of the sale of pointroll and adjusting for exchange rates increased by  yearoveryear reflecting continued growth at carscom offset by revenue declines at careerbuilder during the quarter carscom revenues increased by  in line with our comments in december and our previous earnings call these results reflects strong market penetration in direct sales markets the continued success of new products such as repairpal certified and event positions as well as increased purchasing of display advertising by auto manufacturers these increases were partly offset by the absence of wholesale price increases which occurred in the first quarter of  but occurred during the fourth quarter last year at the time the transaction closed as matt mentioned excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the  lower sales of lower margin transaction products careerbuilder revenues would have been slightly up yearoveryear with these impacts careerbuilders revenues declined  on a constant currency basis digital segment operating expenses were down  due to a slight increase in expenses at carscom primarily driven by revenue growth partly offset by direct cost reductions reflecting lower revenues at careerbuilder as a result we achieved solid adjusted ebitda of  million this quarter for the total company and our ebitda margin of  was relatively unchanged yearoveryear despite the negative impacts of the absence of significantly higher margin political revenues that benefited last year our capital investments during the quarter of  million reflect our ongoing commitment to our business priorities including digital development media content product integration and platform enhancements as well as several real estate initiatives which produced immediate cost savings for the year  million was invested in capital projects including onetime build out impacts of the relocation of our seattle television station to a more appropriatelysized space during the quarter strong cash flow from operations combined with the proceeds from the sale of our headquarters building and the sales of some small noncore businesses were used to pay off  million in  senior notes while funding accelerated share repurchases of  million at an average price of  interest payments of  million and to make investments in business initiatives of  million at the end of the quarter our longterm debt stood at  billion and cash on the balance sheet was  million as we look ahead to  as gracia and dave both noted we expect it to be a banner year although we are still in the early stages of the campaign cycle we project total media segment revenues to increase in the highteens to low range for the year also we expect plus revenue growth at carscom with careerbuilder driving low to midsingledigit revenue growth in  through the adoption of their saasbased suite of products which ramps throughout the year all of these drivers will contribute meaningfully to growth in total company revenues in the low to midteen range yearoveryear on the cost front we expect total company expenses to increase in the range of  to  reflecting primarily higher revenues as we expand in richer content as well as broader products and features across our media and digital businesses beyond this well see increased programming costs resulting from new affiliation agreements negotiated during the second half of  capital expenditures for  are expected to be in the range of  million to  million a bit lower than  due to fewer real estate projects planned for the year once again in  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be in invested in digital development media content product integration and platform enhancements for  depreciation is projected to be approximately  million to  million and amortization of  million interest expense will total nearly  million as previously discussed the tax rate is anticipated to be roughly in the  to  range in  though it will vary quartertoquarter with that ill turn the call back to gracia for her closing remarks prior to the qa gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer thanks victoria as you can see from what weve just told you weve made great progress in just six short months and we are very confident about our future and our ability to achieve the longrange plan that we laid for you in june with that we will take questions questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from john janedis please go ahead your line is open john janedis  jefferies llc thank you dave thanks for the comments on differentiating between cable networks and your business so two related questions one is theres also concern around mvpd consolidation so did you see any unusual impact from the att directv renewal and then second do you have any visibility on the ratio of cord shavers relative to cord cutters david t lougee  presidenttegna media so let me take the second one first i would just take up – john i would just say look at public numbers out there relative to what mvpds are reporting relative to their sub losses or in some cases sub gains versus individual cable channels we dont have obviously ourselves any unique data around that other than to point out the fact that there clearly is a significant distinction and your other question i apologize john was gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer mvpd consolidation john janedis  jefferies llc mvpd consolidation around att and direc david t lougee  presidenttegna media yeah so i would just simply say generically no we are – given our scale were able to negotiate appropriately with all current and future consolidated players john janedis  jefferies llc great thanks and then just separately maybe from matt or for gracia its unusual to see expense controls for a company with growing digital assets so with some of the changes at careerbuilder does the expense decline continue and is the transition to saas consistent in terms of the timeline and then i guess given some of the macro headlines is there any evidence of a slowdown in hiring as youve gone through the renewal process gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer ill ask matt to take the question around slowdown in hiring but with respect to the expense side of the equation we have as we indicated previously been in fact investing in our businesses and so for instance weve talked about with careerbuilder in the latter half of  investing  million to  million in additional sales and development resources and were going to be investing over and above our normal expense side those kinds of dollars as well but then there are other areas that we are always looking to create efficiencies around to let the cars for instance take advantage of some of the procurement activities et cetera et cetera that dont in any way touch the business from a growth perspective but really just make it a more efficient business because of the scale of what we all can buy as one company so i think youll see as we go into  i think weve provided some guidance on the expense side youll see that we are continuing to ramp our investment in those areas that will propel growth into the future matt do you want to take the question on hiring matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc yeah obviously the stock market has been volatile and that creates a little bit of uncertainty i dont see any changes in employers hiring right now and i think when you look at the last couple years theyve probably underinvested  and bringing on new initiatives and as a result in the skilled labor market its just very tight right now i dont think thats changed at all even with the uncertainty going into the first quarter i did see a few contracts that were delayed maybe a few weeks so they were some of the margins decisions that were delayed that may have been unrelated to the economy or maybe it was tied to the economy but nothing significant right now and i think companies are still trying to figure out how to bring on that critical talent in the skilled areas and that has not changed gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer you might mention matt the number of contracts that you matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc yeah if you just look – even if you look at the longterm contracts that weve signed in  we signed  contracts that were  months or longer in duration that was up from  contracts in  that were  months what were seeing right now – and that trend is continuing as i look at  were still paying a good number of multiyear deals in the first part of the year and so there is a great deal of commitment by customers  especially to the software solutions john where they see that being a critical part of their prehire strategies and they want to make longterm commitments to that john janedis  jefferies llc thank you victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president john just to expand one little piece of what  as i look at the budgets for the fourth quarter as well as  spending as budgeted and as planned because were spending on sales and development resources were not getting ahead of that with marketing resources so we very much expect that to continue to ramp as the year go – goes on its really not expense controls per se john janedis  jefferies llc thanks a lot gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer thanks john operator and well take our next question from bill bird please go ahead your line is open bill g bird  fbr capital markets  co thank you good morning first on cars just based on the figures given it look like affiliate sales were down in the fourth quarter i was just wondering if you could talk about whats happening in that distribution channel and then secondly at careerbuilder do you still expect revenue growth to be positive in the first quarter and could you talk a little bit about trends in advertising and résumé database thank you alex vetter  president  chief executive officer carscom llc sure bill bill this is alex vetter at carscom i think one of the things were seeing as you are aware that we cycled through a onetime wholesale price increase last year and so our wholesale channel model continues to work to cycle through that price change in their local markets which obviously is challenging for them but theyve largely gotten through it and we see them getting back to the growth rate towards in  gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer yeah and also you may recall bill that we had put a price increase in place on october   when we first acquired cars and weve said that we were going to get them back on the cycle of january  increases so the fourth quarter particularly affiliates were impacted – affiliate revenue was impacted by that absence of a price increase so we have to cycle that price increase from the prior year but matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc yeah on your question on q we expect it will be down a little bit yearoveryear and that will be up starting in q on the – i think you also asked a question about résumés if we look at total registrations total registrations in the united states are almost at  million and thats up  yearoveryear and then résumés in the month of january were up single digits new résumés so thats new résumés being added in that month versus the previous year in that month were up in the kind of the midsingledigit range yearoveryear gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer let me just add a little color to what matt said with respect to the growth rate i dont think we talked about careerbuilder going to a positive growth rate in the first quarter because if you look at the first quarter  their revenues were actually up i think about a little  around  and it was really preceded the intentional review that they did and strategic review they did of the relationships and so they wont cycle that in the first quarter although well see some nice gains in some other areas that will lead to what matt has indicated but then we should see as weve cycled those activities those gains begin to clearly ramp in the remaining three quarters to get us to the guidance we gave you and we have some good fairly decent line of sight on that bill g bird  fbr capital markets  co and so just going back to cars so effectively im familiar with the yearago affiliate price increase so your pricing effectively was flat and so im wondering why were affiliate revenues down gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer yeah we dont give specifics with respect to the performance of our affiliates for obvious reasons what i can tell you is frankly we have some affiliates that are just doing a fantastic job in some very specific markets and were incredibly pleased with their performance unfortunately we have an affiliate group or so that in some markets are not doing the job that either they should do for themselves or are contributing but we are working very diligently with those underperformers to give them some opportunities to pick up that performance because it isnt just money for cars its money for them and i cant imagine that they would not want to have those revenues come into their coffers as well so its a combination of those two things bill g bird  fbr capital markets  co great thank you operator and well go next to doug arthur please go ahead your line is open douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc yeah thanks two questions on cars gracia i believe going back to the analyst day you or victoria talked about a longterm margin guide for cars of  to  im wondering if you can just talk about a is that still in play and b kind of how do you see the ramp and then alex you talked about a few adjacencies such as the repair market that youre actively in now are there any other adjacencies that long term youre looking at thanks victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah just to answer your first question relative to your ebitda margin we exited  very much on that trajectory and based on the numbers that were seeing for the  budget were accelerating towards that we expect to be within if not at the higher end of that range so were very confident on that gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer yeah we are – we made – alex and his team made great progress on that obviously helped by the new affiliation agreements but also in a lot of the new product development et cetera that theyve done that has gained some traction so we feel very confident of that ebitda trajectory alex vetter  president  chief executive officer carscom llc yeah and in terms of the adjacencies our move to singular ownership last year really allowed us to reinvest in our future which is why we were able to build five new commercial products in one year historically that may be have only have only been one maybe two at best in all of those products i think are still in the early stages of growth and we expect those continue to generate returns for the business both in  and beyond i think obviously weve built a platform model that is highly scalable weve got a very strong brand both with consumers and the trade industry and so i think that opens up a lot of opportunities for us to explore new markets that we can leverage our expertise and our scale i dont want to get into those specifically right now but we see a lot of opportunities to reinvest into the business on an ongoing basis douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc okay great thank you gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer thanks doug operator and our next question comes from marci ryvicker please go ahead your line is open marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc thanks victoria you gave one piece of information on the extra four days thats the  million of incremental media segment revenue can you give us the ebitda for that segment as well as the digital revenue and ebitda that came from those four extra days victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president well digital is largely already on a calendar basis so the  million is totally mediaspecific and it is just the four days marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president and  about a  of eps so about millionebitdaish marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc and then what – core was up  million victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president right marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc i assume that that is also impacted by the four extra days what would the core have been applestoapples gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer i think the core applestoapples would have been about ish – low to lowsingle digits marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay so lowsingle for core and then in terms of careerbuilder weve got gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer im sorry marci remembering that in octobernovember we had displacement and december really was our first real month to look at and frankly we were very pleased with the way core ended the quarter in a very positive way marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay and then we got sort of two comments on careerbuilder one was that revenue will be up low single to midsingle in  and then we got a midsingle so i guess were trying to understand gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer midsingles marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc so youre ending near midsingle or all of  will be up midsingle gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer the year will be up midsingles marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer each quarter however will have it – as i said the first quarter will be lower marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer it will ramp and will get to an overall year of midsingles marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay perfect and then one last question in the quarter careerbuilder was down  constant currency do you have that number including foreign exchange victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president it would have been about another point matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc yeah victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president about  matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc right at  victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah marci l ryvicker  wells fargo securities llc okay thank you gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer thanks operator and your next question comes from craig huber please go ahead your line is open craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc yes good morning just first a point of clarification i believe last quarter you had other assets line is that all discontinued or some of those assets move into the media broadcasting segments what happened there please gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer its all discontinued ops craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc okay and secondly gracia or someone can you just speak a little bit further about the  growth in carscom you blamed part of that on the lack of a price increase thats delayed by three months historically though isnt your price increases more like in the  to  range was there anything else that was impacted that was a more economicdriven growth rate there well i thought terrible its a lot lower than midteens has been historically adjusting for affiliate contracts stuff like that gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer first of all we didnt blame it we just are providing the various points of the impacts in the fourth quarter we had indicated that we expected that kind of growth in the fourth quarter thats not unusual to have variances quartertoquarter and so the performance at cars in the fourth quarter met all of our expectations obviously there was that pricing delay that took it to january  we are very comfortable based on the trajectory of what we are seeing right now that – as both alex and i have said that we will achieve plus revenue growth for the full year in  again that wont be linear there will be some quarters where it will be highsingles therell be some quarters where it will be lowdouble digits but overall for the full year it will be – we anticipate it will be the plus that we have outlined craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc what else  matthew w ferguson  chief executive officer careerbuilder llc craig i just like to add one point of clarification its well recognized that over the past few years weve reduced our reliance on our channel partners in favor of building out our direct sales so our affiliate partners only represent sub of our business and if you look at the fourth quarter both our direct our major accounts international sales teams all eclipsed  growth for the fourth quarter and i think that really signals sort of the strength in the business that being the majority of the revenue coming in through those three channels craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc is there anything else though that you could specifically talk to that caused a slower growth rate in the fourth quarter im not trying to beat a dead horse here im just trying to understand why the volatility gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer with the price delay that gets you to highsingle digits and what weve talked about is a business that will grow depending on the quarter highsingle digits or lowdouble digits so it is not inconsistent with the trajectory that we have talked about so the reason why were i think struggling with it is because thats a perfectly within the kind of guidance that weve given result for that particular quarter victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah it was right on top of the numbers we gave in december gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer right victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president as well as our previous earnings call so from our perspective it landed right exactly where we had anticipated craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc right fair enough my other question gracia can you – maybe i missed this but your cost outlook for your tv group for this new year maybe excluding the new affiliate contracts what should investors sort of expect there for this new year please gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer i think we had talked about an unexpected growth rate in sort of the  kind of range relative to program expenses and those types of things as some of it is going into content development a number of the new initiatives that dave talked about obviously linear with revenue as that ramps through the year so it wont be exactly every quarter david t lougee  presidenttegna media and some increased costs relative to political advertising as well gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer right craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc was that up  excluding the network comp bump or including that gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer no that is including that was the guidance you gave for the full year for tegna media so that would include every element of it victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president right craig anthony huber  huber research partners llc great thank you operator and well take our next question from tracy young please go ahead your line is open tracy young  evercore group llc yeah hi just following up on your comments about broadcasting i believe you gave guidance for the quarter of about  and it sounds like you came in close to the  so just wondering what the change might have been through the course of the quarter and then also with auto up there is some concern among investors that were reaching peak saar and so what that could mean for auto advertising thanks gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer auto was up and i can only attribute the higherthanexpectation core advertising on the great efforts by our sales group additional products that theyre selling on the digital side the growth of our digital products and full solutions that theyre able to offer their clients but dave i dont know if theres anything more specific david t lougee  presidenttegna media i want to make sure i understood the question was it a question about the – on the four versus the one could you repeat the question please im sorry tracy young  evercore group llc yeah just wondering i know that there were some maybe not as much visibility going into the quarter given some of the crowding out from the prior year just the guidance originally was  and you came in i guess  excluding those four days david t lougee  presidenttegna media yes so to gracias point i mean we did a nice job on the local sales efforts auto was good and strong as we had hoped and so i just put it there its a little – always tough to estimate and were up against the political quarter the previous year sometimes on the numbers so thats what i attribute it to gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer yeah and it wasnt necessarily political we had some political but that wasnt a big swing factor it was really in the core part of the business david t lougee  presidenttegna media thats right tracy young  evercore group llc okay thanks operator and well go next to barry lucas please go ahead your line is open barry l lucas  gabelli  company thanks and good morning just a couple on the tv side dave could you set a baseline for either  or  political and were looking obviously for a bumper crop but any color you can provide within the primaries on maybe the donalds spending on that david t lougee  presidenttegna media yeah i think its really difficult for us to break out spending frankly by candidates or – other than just to say in the aggregate that the total dollars in the system on a presidentialtopresidential year compared to  are a lot larger we know that from public information obviously out there and spending were already seeing in south carolina so we have every reason to know that combination of primary plus general for  should be significantly ahead of  gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer but to put the baseline for you barry we did call it  million of political in  the last presidential election year we did  million in  so that kind of gives you a baseline and that includes – thats a pro forma number including the belo stations and the london stations barry l lucas  gabelli  company right thanks and in the past youve talked a little bit about what the trajectory of retrans could look like i was hoping you can take the opportunity to do the same for  gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer yeah i think on our last call we talked in  to  range i think we feel much more comfortable at the high end of that range percentage increase yearoveryear in total barry l lucas  gabelli  company right okay so without putting any words in your mouth gracia how comfortable when you now look at the affiliation agreements that are in place and the renewals with the mvpds that were going to cycle healthy net retrans gains over the length of those two comparable agreements gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer i feel extremely good about  i think weve talked about with respect to  we have the big – bigger cliff with our nbc stations the former gannett nbc stations coming up so there will be a blip there but as you heard at investor day dave and his team through a number of initiatives are looking to fill that gap in  so you might not see it in the – you might see the reverse retransmission hit but we anticipate that that will be offset by the performance of the initiatives that dave has outlined and then we feel good about the outer years when we dont have that cliff that we have from the nbc station victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president and just to reiterate its all very well if not at the high end of what we have provided at investor day post all of those negotiations barry l lucas  gabelli  company terrific thank you so much for the color gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer thanks barry i think we have got time for maybe one more question operator and our next question comes from alexia quadrani please go ahead your line is open alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc thank you actually gracia just following up on your comment just now about this sort of a longer term trajectory of retrans i guess my question is one you had this impressive retrans versus last couple of years looks like itll continue this year obviously given your guide but when you cycle through these new renewals i guess what sort of rate should we – what sort of is a good run rate we should consider for retrans growth sort of in the outer years given that these contracts seem very long term gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer well the retrans agreements arent very long term we still have a mix of dates on those so by the time we get to those outer years well be having another opportunity to readjust our rates to the market but dave why dont you add that david t lougee  presidenttegna media yeah ill just say to gracias point while i reference that with  of our subs going out several years the majority of them do not and in fact we have a very large percentage of the top line sub part of it up within the end – toward the end of this year so a significant amount so weve got far more opportunity to continue to grow the top line piece alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc and it sounds like from i guess what youre suggesting that there is still a fair amount of – a big gap between i guess what you deserve to get and what you guys are currently being paid gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer we definitely believe that to be the case alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc and then just to follow up quickly on the advertising side i believe you gave the advertising core outlook for the first quarter and i apologize i missed it but any color you can give for the fullyear and any sort of i guess color if youre seeing or assuming any kind of macro weakness in your budget and your guide gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer no i think victoria went through that victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president we answer the first quarter relatively gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer but the full year the full year alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc yeah gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer i think weve talked about it being in the ish victoria dux harker  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah in the lows gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer lows for the full year total revenues for tegna media we obviously have built in an economy that continues to kind of stumble along we havent built in any big recovery we conversely havent built in a recession that would be deep and extended in period of time obviously there are levers we would pull if something like that happened but we havent anticipated that the economy is going to get any better from here its kind of just a bumbling along economy alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you very much gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer no offense to the fed alexia s quadrani  jpmorgan securities llc thank you gracia c martore  president and chief executive officer okay i think that weve taken our full allotment of time thank you all for joining us today operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude todays program you may disconnect at this time thank

particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
