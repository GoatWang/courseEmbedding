do you dislikethat the report linker site only provided broad overview information when it seemed to promise something more specific and tailored i was unable to preview before i bought the service however once i had paid i was unable to find anything remotely like the search engne had promised i felt very let down particularly as i had spoken to eport link staff and tried to get a preview i actually felt a bit duped my enquiry was followed up and what happened to my request was very unusual someone actually listened and took ownership i really did not expect this and had written off the fee as a bad experience i then received a further emaila dn offer to assist when the member of staff was unable to i was offered a refund that is going above and beyond very well done to report linker
