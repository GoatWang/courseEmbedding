daily face shield broad spectrum spf  sunscreen  laura mercier product review skinfood daily routine Â» laura laura Â» new zealand food beauty diy  lifestyle blog twitter facebook pinterest instagram bloglovin email beauty product review skinfood daily routine november   i was super lucky to be sent the skinfood skin care range to test try and review being a fan of natural and new zealand made i was super excited to get my hands on anything skinfood â€“ with huge expectations from myself and husband we were pleasantly surprised my skinfood routines morning in the shower i use the cleans all exfoliating scrub when i jump out of the shower i pop on a layer of the light moisturiser nourishing moisturiser this routine leaves my skin nourished smooth and noticeablyÂ fresh looking and clean oily problem areas have cleaned up and dry areas are gone putting on the cleanser it feels as though iâ€™m putting what only can be described as â€˜thick waterâ€™ â€“ haha it sounds strange but honestly thats what it feels like super smooth and just oh so good nighttime light moisturiser after removing all makeup  i put quite a bit on as in my head nighttime is the perfect time for my skin to absorb moisturisers sort of like giving myself a facial yeah nah maybe  iâ€™ve used the cleanser as a eyeÂ makeupÂ remover a few times and it was actually pretty great at removing mascara pop a small amount on a tissue and use your fingers to gently rub the makeup off itâ€™s strong enough to get of tough mascara gel mascaras but soft enough not to hurt your delicate eye areas other  daily  when i think about it when body butter made its debut all those years ago i gave it a go and decided i actually hated it most of the brands that brought them out had amazing strong smelling tubs of the stuff but left my skin and hands with a wetnotabsorbed feel almost oily ew i decided to give the skinfood body butter a shot though it smelt really delicate and when i tried a small amount on my arms i was happy with how it actually absorbed into my skin quickly honestly i cannot live without this body butterÂ itâ€™s so freakinâ€™ amazing my legs used to have noticeably dry areas especially at the front this little tub got right in there and cleared it up and left the rest of my body feeling amazing you need it in your life skinfood had a â€˜new look revealâ€™ last week with amazing new branding and new products their body bars sound amazing libby from julialibby went along and spoke â€“ check out their facebook post here to find out more about the new look reveal where to buy all good supermarkets and the warehouse nationwide the range goes from lip balms to face masks to shaving gel to body butters and everything in between for more information visit the skinfood

and thinker tuesday september    products to use daily lauras favourite things its amazing all the stuff we use on any given day nail files pasta spoons bandaids sun hats candles ok thats a weird list but you get the idea ultimately though you gravitate towards certain items things you just couldnt do without on a day to day basis today i want to talk to you about the top  items in my life that i use every single day the things that make my life better easier or just plain happier kind of like oprahs favourite things except i cant afford to give anyone a car im not including my phone tablet or laptop on this list im sure you all understand the extreme need for these things in daily life this top  will focus on beauty products organizational products and lifestyle products that i couldnt do without and here they are  aveeno suncare products im a big aveeno girl the exfoliant the daily moisturizer and the toner are part of my daily routine but the two products i value at the top of the list the clear complexion bb cream with spf  for your face and the daily moisturizing lotion for your body with spf  i cant stress this enough people daily sunscreen application even when its cloudy or winter or raining cats and dogs i apply the bb cream to my face it has a nice tint to even out my complexion and the daily moisturizing lotion to my chest arms and shoulders to keep me covered lets keep wrinkles at bay  smashbox blendable colour stick this little beauty has been my go to makeup trick for the past  months the la lights blendable lip and cheek colour from smashbox cosmetics in canyon coral was the perfect summer colour for my cheekbones or the added lip touch up im going to switch it to the more rosy echo park pink for fall and winter it glides on smooth blends great lasts all day long and lasts forever because you really only need a dab to put colour into your cheeks it also comes with a blender at the end of the stick for on the go touch ups to your cheeks and lips when you dont have a beauty sponge with you convenient  bando planner i live and die by the planner as an aggressively typea individual who likes to micromanage in the extreme and plans my time out weeks in advance having a good planner is aÂ necessity ive gone through many iterations but my newest one is an  month beauty with stickers inspirational notes and good amounts of space for monthly or daily planning i actually wrote a blog post on this planner when i got it because i was so excited and i stand by it ill be needing a new one soon and will definitely be getting the same one  davids tea infuser mug and earl grey loose leaf i am a tea fanatic i start every day with a cup of earl grey made in my tea mug with infuser from davids teas because ill sometimes drink between three to four cups of tea a day i was going through a ton of tea bags before i bought this mug its now one of my favourite thingsÂ   kate spade wristlet a few years ago for my birthday kris bought me a gorgeous kate spade wristlet actually hes bought me a bunch of great kate spade stuff obsessed with the brand but the wristlet is my favourite the perfect size to slide in my ipad mini phone lip gloss hair ties small note pad pen and money pouch i dont carry a wallet it has everything i could possibly need in it at all timesÂ  its brilliant i either loop it around my wrist when im running errands or transfer it from bag to bag so that i always have my essentials grouped together and easy to find in the depths of whatever bag i happen to be carrying that dayÂ  unfortunately after two years of daily use its starting to show its age but i have my eye on this cute replacement  ereader i was a late convert to the ereader club but i am on board now i have a pretty extensive book collection and no where to put it so buying more books is becoming less of an option plus when it comes to travel or commuting ereaders are so easy to carry if i download a book and love it ill still buy a hard copy but its nice to know that i have some solid literature at my finger tips on the go  chanel shades i dont want to alarm anyone but my chanel shades are magic seriously i was visiting new york in the spring my first visit id just been dumped was horribly depressed and decided to spend some of the down payment money on a nyc shopping trip the trouble was it was raining i mean could it get any worse we went straight to the chanel store in soho and i bought the sunglasses id been coveting for months and when i walked out sunshine for  straight days theyve been my good luck shades ever since it helps that they are beautifulÂ   blogging bullet journal i have a bit of a notebook habit aside from my planner i have a small flip book i keep in my wristlet see above as well as a travel journal for when im flitting about on adventuresÂ  but a blogger needs a dedicated notebookÂ  i keep mine in an easy bullet journal style and make notes on everything from recipes to reattempted recipes to blog post planning to stray thoughts to webinar notes the whole of cook wine and thinker is messily written within its pages i bring it just about everywhere  yoga shoes one of my latest obsessions my sanuk shoes as anyone who spends a lot of time standing on kitchen tiles can tell you its hard on the feet these fab shoes are made from recycled yoga mats they just absorb your foot and are so cozy which is great for when im trying a new recipe or retrying it or perfecting it for the blog  sippy cup last but not least i want to talk to you about my adult sippy cup i dont know how this started but in the early days of our relationship kris and i moved to drinking water out of sippy cups its actually a great way to drink water because you tend to drink it faster through the straw so you can actually get your  cups a day hydration is important folks plus if you accidentally knock it off your nightstand it doesnt spill everywhere and ruin your phone we still have nice glasses for when

oldest first start your review deandra on   pm more reviews by deandra age  skin sensitive fair neutral hair blond straight medium eyes blue this was my favorite spf for years and then the cost of it made me stray to other brands i recently rediscovered this and i still feel that it is one of the very best sunscreens for sensitive skin i cant wear avobenzone at all i had an awful reaction to one of the new ones la roche posay was hyping i find their athelios line to be highly irritating and burning so no chemical sunscreens for me sorry i can only use mineralbased spf also i love laura merciers daily face shield as an alternative to laura merciers tinted moisturizer because it has no added color so you can apply any foundation you like over it you double the spf rating and the finish is better for combination skinprostitanium dioxide sunscreen is broad spectrum and suitable for sensitive skindoes not appear chalkyalthough you can feel it initially it dries to a weightless feel and can be worn under foundationnot too heavy or creamy making it ideal for combination to oily skinskin feels soft and silkyconsits not ideal for oily skin  for an ounce is very expensiveyou have to remember to shake the bottle before dispensing itsummary i really love this sunscreen and was able to use it even when i was having contact dermatitis redness and swelling it seemed to calm my skin rather than aggravate iti dont mind that its a little runny  i think the thinness of it is what keeps it from feeling thick or heavyif you have very dry skin you may have to use another moisturizer with it because it isnt thick and creamyif you have very oily skin there is always a slight risk that mineral sunscreens can contribute to breakouts if the finish of this one is not matte enough for you skinceuticals physical fusion uv defense  has a drier finish but it is tinted and the tint may be too dark if you have fair skin report abuse  of  people found this helpful beautykrazy on   pm more reviews by beautykrazy age  skin combination fair not sure hair brunette wavy coarse eyes hazel overall i really like this sunscreen but i have a few niggles with it that stop me giving it top marks my main niggle is the price its expensive for an ounce of sunscreen i go through sunscreen and this one in particular as its so light and slippy like gangbusters so if i bought this again it would be a spendy treat mercier products are pricey and usually youre getting quality for your money this is quality but for the price i really want spf or above for a high end high price sunscreen and at spf this comes in a little low for my liking i also wish it lasted longer im still on the hunt for that perfect sunscreenas i say its light and slippy and i worried that i wasnt getting enough coverage to properly protect me however it does seem to have stable and efficient sun protection despite its lightness of feel its oilfree but it is siliconey so i can see this either not being a good idea for oily skin or perhaps interfering with your preferred skincaremakeup routine i enjoyed its light feel under makeup and the silicone helps makeup glide on smoothly with none of the heavy stickiness of many sunscreens another plus is that it leaves no white cast and doesnt look like you have sunscreen on its good for sensitive skin i just seemed to use this up very quickly so its a bit too pricey to be my everyday sunscreen but i would repurchase its certainly a reliable option report abuse  of  people found this helpful mariscrane on   am more reviews by mariscrane age  skin oily fairmedium warm hair brunette straight fine eyes brown i dont have mega oily skin but it doesnt take much to push it over the edge for that reason he sunscreens like this are a good investment because i dont break out and they dont run out quickly i first tried this a few years ago in a promotional sample kit with the coconut scrub and eye serum would gladly have purchased full sizes of any of them but the flawless face shield won me over hands down the sample alone lasted for weeks and i was using it everyday the liquid is kind of sparkly and opalescent smells expensive and absorbs super fast you only need a fine layer and youre protected  totally worth going for the  oz gotta love laura mercier face products i seriously have yet to be disappointed report abuse modernnomad on   pm more reviews by modernnomad age  skin normal other not sure hair brunette other other eyes hazel was using this for awhile and liked it then but just switched to la roche posay antehelios ultra light spf  and its soooooo much better than the lm the lm is greasier takes longer to set to matte gets greasier as it wears so makeup disappears and it also gets sandy feeling if you sweat check my review of the antehelios  it wears sooooo much better under makeup almost like a primer colors stay true my makeup stays on and its cheaper with a higher spf so i wont be buying the laura mercier again too expensive for what it is report abuse ceen on   pm more reviews by ceen age  skin acneprone fair not sure hair black other other eyes black divine oil free lightweight readily absorbed wearable under tinted moisturiser and all with a decent spf of  devoid of whitecast whats not to like report abuse  of  people found this helpful linneahurtig on   am more reviews by linneahurtig age  skin combination medium warm hair blond straight fine eyes blue this is an amazing sunscreen im all about layering my skincare and ive tried many expensive sunscreens such as jan marinis sunscreen skinceuticals sunscreen ive used both their skincare systems currently on skinceuticals peter thomas roth sunscreen etc this one outstands them all ive got oily skin all year around and this one is perfect for me as its not heavy or sticky its smooth easy to blend in and most importantly  it doesnt break me out d will repurchase this forever report abuse  of  people found this helpful dictatorprincess on   pm more reviews by dictatorprincess age  skin very dry fair cool hair blond other other eyes green im not a big fan of layering multiple products on my face which means that in the summer everything gets nixed for sunscreen until i met this product this is the only sunscreen i am able to wear with foundation or tm make sure the sunscreen in the tm or foundation you use doesnt make this unstable it works as a great primer and doesnt bead or splotch even in hot weather i wear on my chest as well if my shirt is cut low and i havent had any breakouts down there i have dry skin and it is a little drying on the coldest days of winter but the rest of the time it is fine i am in love report abuse  of  people found this helpful rowergirl on   am more reviews by rowergirl age  skin combination medium not sure hair brown other other eyes brown i am returning this product i was told that this is a day cream with sunscreen i noticed that my skin still felt a little dry after i put it on when i read the packaging carefully it said that this be applied over moisturizer i am not paying  for sunscreen only when i can get a combination day cream with spf i was misled by the saleswoman which is disappointing report abuse ibraille on   pm more reviews by ibraille age  skin acneprone medium warm hair brunette wavy coarse eyes brown dmn this is expensive and yet worth every penny for me it doesnt cause any type of irritation breakouts or greasy oil slick it works as both a light moisturizer and primer it helps my foundation go on even more smoothly and last longer i think it is slightly water resistance because even when i perspire i dont find that it breaks down also no white cast it is a very runny liquid the best way to spread this without using half the bottle is to make sure your face is slightly damp i spritz water lightly on right before and it works great that way i dab it on forehead cheeks chin and spread then go back and do around the eyes with a teeny bit more sinks in quickly pricey but def hg for me report abuse  of  people found this helpful shordeecat on   pm more reviews by shordeecat age  skin dry medium warm hair black other medium eyes brown i love love love this product it is a runny consistency but leaves the skin feeling silky smooth a little goes a long way it is awesome under makeup and can be used instead of a primer its oil controlling and supposedly helps your skin adjust to extreme climates i like that it is spf  and feel extremely lightweight definitely recommend report abuse  of  people found this
