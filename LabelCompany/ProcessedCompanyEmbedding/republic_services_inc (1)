the site of an underground event of concern to residents and the epa since  when republic services installed equipment to flare off gasses and treat contaminated liquid the levels of contaminants released into the air have mostly fallen below regulatory acceptable levels in  the company said it would build a barrier to separate the two landfills but because the epa was uncertain where the radioactive contamination was located progress on the barrier was delayed for more than a year in march  the epa released studies which showed the extent of the radioactive waste on the site and allowed the company to build a barrier without disturbing the radioactive areas during the construction of the barrier republic also must submit plans for a cooling system which must be completed within four months of commencement of construction the company will also enlarge onto the north quarry of bridgeton landfill a plastic liner that it already installed over the south quarry environmental protection agency region  administrator mark hague said this should help control the reaction by blocking oxygen “as well as mitigate some of the odors coming off of this site” republic will also install more temperature monitors plus two sulfur dioxide monitors to track unhealthy emissions they will also be required to develop a system which can quickly extinguish any new hot spots

api will be completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
