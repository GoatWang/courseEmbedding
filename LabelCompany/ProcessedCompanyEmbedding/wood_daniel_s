while still focusing on having fun with shooting galleries john daniels you can trace the beginning of dwl all the way back to when john was in grade school drawing pictures instead of listening to his teacher during high school john started carving small faces and made a little money selling them a short time later he tried carving with a chainsaw and realized he was a natural right from the beginning and he’s been carving ever since in  john decided to build a clubhouse set atop a real hollowed log took it to a home  garden show and sold dozens of them the rest is history grilling product review jack daniel’s whiskey grilling pellets  grilljunkie  addiction to grilling grilling product review jack daniel’s whiskey grilling pellets jack daniel’s grilling pellets sinatra worthy or dud on a consistent basis the team here at grilljunkie™ sets time aside to communicate our formal opinion on either a grilling bbq or burger related product or event such as a bbq pitmaster contest a chili cookoff or a tailgating event as you certainly can imagine and most likely have experienced yourself these products and events run the gamut from gotta have it cool useful utilitarian ridiculous and the well just plain asinine today’s candidate is jack daniel’s tennessee whiskey grilling pellets the grilljunkie™ grilling product review gpr scale in addition to a formal written review we also assign a visual indication of our opinion to every product as depicted through our grilling product review gpr scale first up a bit of grilling pellet history what exactly are grilling pellets what’s the big deal even if you just casually know enough about grilling and bbq to be moderately dangerous chances are you’ve heard of the growing popularity of using pellets for grilling bbq and smoking the trager lil texas elite wood pellet grill here’s a brief bit of history and background back in  joe traeger fortunately was less focused on cheezy metal bands jean jackets and big hair and focused his attention on starting up traeger grills from his blood sweat and tears came the introduction of the first pellet grill to the world since then the traeger family has continued to make pellet grills and smokers and have attracted what would certainly be categorized as a “cult following” this success and insatiable demand lead to a wide range of pellet grills and smokers on the market the unique flavor that is created by the use of a pellet grill combined with their versatility have made pellet grills a favorite among backyard cooking zealots the main appeal of pellet grills is their versatility of being fully capable of grilling roasting barbecuing and smoking the star fuel of the show wood grilling pellets okay so we’ve learned about the wood pellet grills what about their fuel source a wood pellet in essence is a small ″ diameter piece of natural hardwood that looks like a long pill sometimes like a small piece of black licorice when pellets are made all of the air within the cellular structure of the wood is evacuated thus concentrating the wood into a very dense form much denser than the natural tree as compared to other wood flavor enhancers pellets will yield a more intense smoke more quickly which seals the food locking in natural moisture and adding smoke flavor exactly when it’s needed due to their small size wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash wood pellets burn at about  btus per pound and are marketed in a wide variety of “flavors” ranging from traditional bbq and smoking woods such as hickory and oak to cherry apple or mesquite the pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate this rate is adjustable based on whether a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking is desired because of the automated feed of the wood pellets you can basically turn the grill on give it  to  minutes to heat up and be ready to grill in almost no time this makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking the sinatra test jack daniel’s tennessee whiskey grilling pellets before we proceed to the formal review it is important to note that our reviews follow an organized and comprehensive structure which includes the problem that needs to be solved or addressed the product’s solution to that problem followed by the good the bad and the infrequent ugly elements of the product or service finally we provide a verdict along with an official grilljunkie™ gpr grilling product rating so let’s dig in to the jack daniel’s tennessee whiskey grilling pellets review official product review and gpr  problem – the way we view it the wood grilling pellet market has quickly become infiltrated with poorly made mass produced wood pellets with no competitive differentiation predictable flavor categories and utilitarian packaging the demand for an expanded flavor spectrum packaged in an attention grabbing and informative package is high and the opportunity is ripe for the taking product’s solution pitch – the product addresses the problem by developing marketing and distributing a lineup of grilling accessories and fuel sources among which is specifically targeted towards the wood grilling pellet consumer specifically the product pitch ad copy reads  “jack daniel’s smoking pellets are made from the actual mellowing charcoal from the distillery pulverized and mixed with sawdust then pelletized the pellets give a strong sweet smoke flavor and an aromatic tang to a variety of grilled meats including beef pork poultry and game” the good – the product has  positive attributes first the product directly addresses the issue of flavor choice limitations by infusing the distinctive flavor and aroma of jack daniel’s tennessee whiskey the product provides the consumer with an expanded choice beyond the traditional hardwood and fruitwood offerings the grilljunkie™ team used the grilling pellets on a quickly seared steak and slowly bbq’d and smoked brisket ribs and venison and found that the product is easy to use and produces a great amount of smoke that permeates the meat detectable in both aroma and taste jack daniel’s smoking pellets are made from the used mellowing charcoal from the jack daniel’s distillery in lynchburg tennessee this charcoal is soaked in whiskey for weeks before exchanging for a fresh batch of charcoal the charcoal is mixed with oak and processed into wood pellets for bbq smoking secondly the product is attractively packaged with the eyegrabbing brand attention of a well known american whiskey brand  here are a few statistics that our product review team recorded contents mellowed charcoal and natural oak hardwood saturated with jack daniel’s whiskey burn rate –  pound per hour  degrees f   pounds per hour   degrees f ash residual –  cup of ash per  pound bag optimal applications – best on beef pork poultry and game the bad – there are  important negative attributes to this product the first is easily forgiven the second not so easily ignored first you will have to overcome the urge to draw out your shot or drinking glass as the distinctive jack daniel’s tennessee whiskey aroma may temporarily seduce you into overlooking its unfamiliar form and tape a sip secondly this product will give the wood pellet “purist” a bit of outdoor grilling agita due to the fact that they are not made purely from hardwood sawdust they are in fact made from if you didn’t already catch this from their product pitch the actual mellowing charcoal from the distillery pulverized and mixed with hardwood oak sawdust then pelletized the ugly – we did not believe that this variable applied to this product this variable is usually mentioned for the strange extremely unique or outright asinine product an example of strange would be our product review of mcphee’s bacon body wash wherein besides the obvious we took a shot at their package design enough said let’s move on verdict – we give the jack daniel’s tennessee whiskey grilling pellets  out of  grilljunkie™ gpr firepots which equates to a hot product but not quite searing this product addresses and solves the problem for which it was designed the product at its basic level grilling pellets is not necessarily unique as the grilling pellet market is maturing however because of the strength of the jack daniel’s brand awareness the product immediately draws attention and delivers albeit with a nonpurist manufacturing twist we found that this product infused a strong but not overwhelming aromatic tang and smokiness to a variety of grilled meats including beef pork poultry and game while maintaining slightly better than average burn rate and low ash residual sinatra worthy at the end of the day we believe that the folks at jack daniels should be proud of this product by bridgebranding over into the grilling and bbq realm they prove that they still understand the demographics of their fan base the true test however would be what the great frank sinatra would think if he owned a pellet grill and was aware of jack daniel’s continuing contribution “basically i’m for anything that gets you through the night – be it prayer tranquilizers or a bottle of jack daniel’s” frank sinatra next review  broil king® monarch ™ what are your thoughts what fires you up we
