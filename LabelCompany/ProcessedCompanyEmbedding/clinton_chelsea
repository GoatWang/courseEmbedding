homesubscribe advertisement sign up for the breitbart email newsletter sign me up peter schweizer clinton global initiative folded because they can no longer ‘sell access to political power’ michael loccisanogetty images by john hayward jan   jan   jan  clinton cash author and breitbart news senior editoratlarge peter schweizer joined siriusxm host alex marlow on tuesday’s breitbart news daily for what marlow described as a “victory lap” over the demise of the clinton global initiative whose questionable activities featured so prominently in schweizer’s book marlow saluted the work done by schweizer and his government accountability institute as “some of the most essential reporting of the  election” and said they collected a “major scalp” this week with the end of the cgiadvertisement “thank you alex certainly breitbart was right there i cannot imagine how many stories—it’s got to be north of a hundred stories on clinton corruption—played an essential role” schweizer said he said the shutdown of the clinton global initiative was a “remarkable event” because “the clintons have essentially made it so obvious that there’s a connection between this socalled charitable activity cgi and their political fortunes” schweizer went on they didn’t even wait until the election was a distant memory to say you know what we’re going to wrap this up they ended it immediately i think it’s just further confirmation to what we always believed which is that their charitable activities really were directly linked to their political power and now that that political power is gone really honestly for the first time in  years – think about that –  years the clintons have been on the national political stage they’re gone and they’re essentially saying ‘look there’s no need or purpose behind doing this charitable work so we’re just going to shut it down’ it’s a pretty remarkable step on their part schweizer chuckled at marlow’s suggestion that the clintons should have kept their organization running for a little while with a few headlineready boasts about how it was “stronger than ever” just to maintain appearances he said no they just rolled it up and you’re exactly right they didn’t pretend in a matter of weeks from the election results—it’s pretty stunning i think we’ve also now got the clinton foundation itself which is involved with cgi obviously but they’re essentially separate entities their donations are way off they’ve got a lot of foreign donations the government of australia for example and germany who are essentially saying ‘we’re not going to donate any more’ donations are down by some accounts by  so it may be that the clinton foundation goes the way of cgi “or it could be which i think is probably more likely—i just can’t imagine them completely folding up their tent—i think it will be sort of a shadow of its former self maybe onetenth the size of what it once was” he ventured “because let’s face it what we talked about has been confirmed by the podesta emails it’s been confirmed by these events if they can’t sell access to political power they just don’t have a product in the form of their form of philanthropy that people want to donate to” “that presents an essential problem that means they have to seek some office somewhere so they can still sell access does chelsea now have to bring the next generation forth so they can continue with this political apparatus there’s a lot of talk of that that chelsea’s going to run for congress potentially in two years” schweizer noted he expressed some appreciation for the difficult road chelsea clinton has walked pointing out that the leaked emails from clinton campaign chief john podesta portrayed her as one of the few highlyplaced people in the clinton foundation who realized something fishy was going on and called for extensive audits “bill and hillary were fine with what was going on the aides around them were fine it was really chelsea who was pushing this reform agenda so i give her credit for that” schweizer said before going on to agree with marlow that she lacks the “presence” for a successful political career even from a celebrityobsessed manhattan precinct controlled by the democrat machine “you’ve still got to show you’ve got the chops to actually get things done for your district in congress… that you have a certain innate strength and an ability to perform i don’t think the celebrity is going to be enough” he judged “she’s going to have to prove that” he said chelsea clinton’s only guaranteed campaign asset would be “a lot of money because the clinton financial network is there” “hillary clinton did not win in november but remember alex they raised a lot of money for that race” schweizer pointed out “their ability to raise a lot of money for chelsea i don’t think should be underestimated” he said that beyond vague hopes of launching chelsea’s political career it remained a “great mystery” where the clintons would go from here schweizer pointed out really since  they have been part of the national conversation bill ran for president he said you’re getting two for one so he made it clear immediately that hillary was going to be a political player as well they leave the white house just as hillary enters the us senate she then runs for president in  and loses she then becomes secretary of state and other than this window between january of  up until she announced her campaign in  they have been in political office with political power i think it’s very hard to give that up once you’ve had it schweizer said he doubted hillary clinton would try another presidential run in  and that even “people in the echo chamber around them” would point out her advancing age and weakness on the campaign trail in  he also suggested there was resentment of clinton within the democratic party itself “we know they had the election wired against bernie sanders we know they’ve got a lot of allies but there is a lot of bubbling resentment among the democratic grassroots that the clintons need to go they had their turn they had their chance a lot of democrats are convinced that if they just had a different candidate they could have beat donald trump i don’t think that’s true but i think there’s a lot of that thought out there” he said schweizer predicted so they may be thinking about some run for higher office again but i just don’t think the democratic party is the same party of the s i think we’re going to see them—probably kicking and screaming—fade into history i just don’t see this as a dynasty like the bush dynasty for example where you’ve got a sort of upandcoming generation that can potentially run for national office the clintons just simply don’t have that and i think we’re going to see them fade into history essentially as for his own future plans schweizer said he was “cautiously optimistic” about government ethics under the new administration although he noted he pushed hard for presidentelect trump to fully divest his assets a path he chose not to pursue “in that sense i’m disappointed but really honestly alex when you look what he has done he has gone far beyond what i believe the legal requirements were for him to do so i give him a lot of credit for that” he said schweizer asked of trump’s children and associates i think really now it’s going to come down to that whole issue of performance how do they handle these issues’ if the kids are offered a sweetheart deal if they have a chance to do something and think that it can go undetected are they going to be tempted or are they going to take that deal that’s really what it comes down to you can set up all kinds of structures you can say all kinds of things but as we’ve seen in the past with other presidents people when they want to make a buck at the public’s expense they’re going to find a quick way around it “so i count myself right now cautiously optimistic i love the trump message of ‘drain the swamp’ i think there’s some very serious things that he is looking at that could get bipartisan support to work to drain the swamp if for no other reason think about this donald trump is the first candidate i would have to say going back more than  years if not longer who is not really beholden to the money class in washington dc the lobbyists the pacs—they didn’t give him money so he doesn’t feel like he owes them anything” schweizer said breitbart news daily airs on siriusxm patriot  weekdays from  am to  am eastern listen ps do you want more articleslike this one delivered right

really work hard on making sure that chelsea doesnt let other people define her sense of her own selfworth  its tough when you are an adolescent  but i think shell be ok the clintons decision to

security people decided to run the story anyway and bill and hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness carol wallace people managing editor affirmed the magazines sensitivity to

cancel k fact check politics chelsea mourning chelsea clinton landed a lucrative job at nbc after graduating college but her salary wasnt  and she wasnt working for her parents k claim chelsea clinton was paid  to work for her parents after she finished college see examples examples collected via email july  rumor going around that chelsea clinton was paid  to work for her parents right out of college is this true false rating false origin shortly after chelsea clinton the daughter of former president bill clinton and democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton completed her master’s degree at columbia’s mailman school of public health in  she landed a rather lucrative job however that job didn’t pay her  per year nor did it involve working for her parents as was widely claimed online chelsea clinton was hired by nbc news as a special correspondent in  she was reportedly paid  a year by the network until  when she switched from an annual salary to a monthtomonth contract due to the possibility of her mother’s running for president chelsea clinton earned an annual salary of  at nbc news before switching to a monthtomonth contract earlier this year sources with knowledge of the agreement said clinton who joined nbc news as a special correspondent in november  was up for renewal or nonrenewal this year instead the sources said the network decided to keep her on the payroll on a monthtomonth basis so the two parties could sever ties if clinton’s mother hillary clinton runs for president chelsea clinton announced in august  a month before the birth of her first child that she would be leaving nbc to focus on philanthropic work at the bill hillary  chelsea clinton foundation nbc news likely awarded chelsea clinton such a hefty contract in part due to her name recognition but she also came to the position with an impressive résumé a ba in history from stanford university a master of public health degree from columbia’s mailman school of public health and a dphil degree in international relations from oxford university in addition to job stints with the consulting firm mckinsey  company and avenue capital group moreover her position with the network did not involve “working for her parents” and her hiring was not out of the ordinary in  jenna bush the daughter of former president george w bush was also hired by nbc as a news correspondent on today and senator john mccain’s daughter megan mccain has held numerous positions at msnbc pivot and fox news the discrepancy between the size of chelsea clinton’s actual contract with nbc  and the amount commonly reported as her salary  as well as the misperception that chelsea was “working for her parents” likely stemmed from conflation involving clinton’s pay for her other positions as vice chair of the “bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation  and as a board member of iacinteractive corp  in addition to her gig at nbc chelsea also serves vice chair of the recently renamed “bill hillary and chelsea clinton foundation” where she was “a major force in steering her parents’ charitable work” in the final years of her mother’s time at the state department chelsea also benefits from a job as a board member for barry diller’s iacinteractivecorp salary for chelsea  the board position also pays an annual retainer of  and a  grant of restricted stock although chelsea clinton’s connections may have helped her land a role at iac her parents do not make the hiring decisions for that internet media holding company paul lapides head of the corporate governance center at kennesaw state university in georgia says those connections may have helped her “there’s no question that she knows a lot of people” he said “ms clinton is a keenly intelligent insightful and inspirational young

bill clinton and us senator hillary clinton bill and hillary named their daughter after a judy collins recording of the joni mitchell song “chelsea morning” while living in arkansas chelsea had a somewhat typical childhood attending forest park elementary school booker arts magnet elementary school and horace mann junior high school chelsea moved to the white house when her father was elected president and inaugurated on january   at the age of  while living at the white house chelsea attended sidwell friends school she enjoyed being a part of the varsity soccer team chelsea had taken some ballet classes beginning at the age of four and at the washington school of ballet in  in the washington ballets production of tchaikovskys the nutcracker in  chelsea played the part of the favorite aunt in  she was a finalist for the national merit scholarship as with any person living in the public eye media poked fun at the teenager of the president of united states on the other hand the clintons did their best to keep their daughter tagged “off limits” however of course this was pretty much impossible a few that did make crude remarks include julia sweeney did an impersonation of chelsea rush limbaugh made crude remarks jess oxfeld was fired from stanford university in  for writing an article about chelsea senator john mccain ridiculed chelsea with an off color joke and the national review author john derbyshire wrote a column attacking chelsea these are just a few of the media attempts to attack or humiliate a young teenager living in the white house chelsea must have taken all the media with a grain of salt as after the presidency she turned down brown harvard princeton and yale and went to stanford university during her first two years at stanford her major was chemistry which she changed to history beginning of her third year she graduated from stanford in  with an undergraduate thesis on the  northern ireland peace agreement after this chelsea went to university college oxford where she earned a masters degree in international relations chelsea went to work at mckinsey  company in new york city in  she was the youngest person hired in her class and was earning a low six figure salary in  she went to work of avenue capital which is a hedge fund ran by marc lasry at this time she is still working at avenue capital avenue capital employees have contributed over  to hillary clintons presidential campaign today you may get a glimpse of chelsea around new york with her boy marc mezvinsky marc is an investment banker and the son of former democratic representative ed mezvinsky of iowa chelsea has known marc since they were both teenagers in washington dc whether chelsea will be seen on the democratic trail along with her mothers

issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement chelsea clinton makes her movechelsea clinton is the product of two of the most powerful brands in the world now she’s finally carving out her own identity–by joining the family business by danielle sackslong readonce upon a time chelsea clinton was a little girl from arkansasadvertisementand deep down she still is despite her white house–stanfordoxfordcolumbiamckinsey–hedgefund grooming she’s still got a thing for poultry “fried chicken is my husband’s favorite food” she divulges in her new office at the clinton foundation a midtown manhattan space outfitted with thick mahogany desks and an inordinate amount of beige that’s brightened ever so slightly by chelsea’s surprisingly casual look–gray suede ankle boots and jeans the first time her thenboyfriend nowhusband marc mezvinsky visited little rock she whisked him off to bojangles her favorite childhood friedchicken hole in new york she explains he’ll now indiscriminately “gorge himself on fried chicken” anywhere from popeyes on th street to the more refined blue ribbon fried chicken in the east village chelsea insists she would get in on the grease too were it not for an allergy to gluten “i was a vegetarian for  years and a pescatarian for eight then i woke up one day when i was  and craved red meat” says chelsea now  and a selfdescribed omnivore “i’m a big believer in listening to my body’s cravings”of course there was another clinton who believed in listening to his body’s cravings and the sad fact that such a harmless statement could call to mind a national embarrassment perfectly illustrates the dilemma facing the scion of one former president and one potential contender for years the world has been wondering what chelsea would do someday wondering especially if she would do things like and with her family “one of my earliest childhood memories is being three years old and on the campaign trail with my dad” says chelsea who was born when her father was governor of arkansas that day a woman approached her and asked “‘do you want to grow up and be governor one day too’ and i looked at her and said ‘no i’m  i’m just waving the flag that is my job right now’ flagwaving extraordinaire”“it is frustrating” says chelsea “because who wants to grow up and follow their parents … it’s funny to realize i feel called to this work as a daughter–proudly as a daughter”for a decade after graduating from stanford in  chelsea experimented with the world beyond the clinton machine in peripatetic bursts she tried out international relations then management consulting then wall street then a phd she even signed on for an embarrassingly lightweight gig as an nbc news “special correspondent” chelsea rationalizes this career promiscuity as a hallmark of being just another millennial experimenting liberally until she figures out her professional purpose but of course she’s not just another millennial she’s political royalty and now finally she has decided to join the clinton family business as vice chair of the recently rebranded bill hillary  chelsea clinton foundation she is helping one of the world’s most notable philanthropies grow up at the democratic national convention in globe photos zuma pressas with all things clinton it is anything but a simple straightforward task reflecting her father’s famously scattered genius the foundation has grown chaotically recently it has been criticized scathingly by the new york times and the new republic for past bureaucratic ineptitude and worse it’s clear that chelsea’s power within the organization and in relation to its many and various power players is a matter of some debate but by applying all that she’s learned from her decade of jobhopping chelsea just may bring order to the organization she’s been there three years and has a solid record and her plans for its future are deeply ambitiousadvertisement“it is frustrating because who wants to grow up and follow their parents” admits chelsea “i’ve tried really hard to care about things that were very different from my parents i was curious if i could care about money on some fundamental level and i couldn’t that wasn’t the metric of success that i wanted in my life i’ve talked about this to my friends who are doctors and whose parents are doctors or who are lawyers and their parents are lawyers it’s a funny thing to realize i feel called to this work both as a daughter–proudly as a daughter–and also as someone who believes that i have contributions to make”working in any family business is complicated working in this one is something else altogether but opting in may turn out to be the best decision chelsea clinton has ever madeenrolling in stanford university back in  was chelsea’s first attempt to cut the umbilical cord connecting her to the family tradition of public life far from the beltway she found herself surrounded by people who used technology rather than politics to solve problems it was the height of the first tech boom and her new friends were dropping out of school to start or join startups including mezvinsky who was also at stanford also the child of politicians and then just a good friend he now runs his own hedge fund “this was all just beginning that moment of being in silicon valley it helped shape all of us” says anne hubert a close friend from chelsea’s freshman year who now works as svp of viacom’s scratch consultancy chelsea who considered premed but majored in history wasn’t drawn to the entrepreneurial life but she did discover that she was “a person who wanted to fix improve expand things”after graduating in  chelsea had no clear plan for how she could apply that inclination she attended oxford university in england where she got her master’s in international relations one day she says “i woke up and thought wow i love this do i want to do a phd and then i realized i’m going to be  and know a whole lot about one thing so i did what everyone i knew was doing when they didn’t know what the right professional answer was for them and applied to different consulting firms i thought that might help sort out if i wanted to have a professional track in health and public health or an academic track or something else altogether”chelsea spent three years at mckinsey working in its public health practice before rising up the ranks to become a team manager in its financial services and technology practice then the doubts encroached again “was i going to continue to work a hundred hours a week and invest time there and energy to remain on the partner track” she says “or was i going to go do something else” “something else” was working as a chemicalindustry analyst at a hedge fund called avenue capital group as with every new job during these years chelsea had to make people forget her heritage she explains that her method of debunking assumptions is pretty simple she behaves as the overachiever that she has always been “i will just always work harder than anybody else and hopefully perform better and hopefully over time i preempt and erase whatever expectations people have of me not having a good work ethic or not being smart or not being motivated”but ultimately she was becoming more frayed than focused she took a leave of absence from avenue to work on hillary’s  campaign after returning to her wall street job she decided to also get her master’s in public health at columbia which entailed night and weekend classes it was a grueling schedule while she enjoyed being in the same industry as mezvinsky–“we both built lots of excel models and can talk about pivot tables together we geek out a lot” she says–the couple had little downtime chelsea left avenue to finish her master’s and got a job as an assistant vice provost at nyuadvertisementsurprisingly it took chelsea and marc’s  wedding to put an end to the meandering according to bari lurie chelsea’s chief of staff the heretofore private chelsea was caught off guard by the level of attention paid to the event “it was abundantly clear there was this pentup interest in her and she couldn’t understand why” says lurie when she had campaigned for her mom in – events in  states–chelsea had first experienced the impact her voice could have in a public setting as lurie explains it “it was ‘gosh everywhere i go it seems like there’s this interest in me how can i displace some of that how can i use that interest to help push forward issues i care about’ ” over the years chelsea had turned to her grandmother many times for advice hillary’s mother had a favorite phrase–“to whom much is given much is expected”–that continually tugged at chelsea the bottom line says lurie is that there was a platform waiting for her if she could only figure out how and when to use it “she quickly realized ‘there is nothing i’m doing now that’s satiating this interest this doingnothing thing i’ve tried it and it didn’t work’ ”chelsea’s todo listpart data geek part dynasty daughter part celebrity chelsea’s found a way to thrive both within and without the family business ramin talaiegetty images  justin sullivan

congress–someday find time for date night with marc despite all this the bill hillary  chelsea clinton foundation is not a foundation unlike the gates or rockefeller foundations which function as trusts managing the disposal of the families’ wealth the clinton’s organization is actually a charity that must raise money from others in order to do work on the ground this is just the beginning of the confusing nature of this philanthropic bureaucracy the group has eight ceos one eric braverman is ceo of the whole enterprise which is in some ways an umbrella organization for nine separate “initiatives” and two “entities” in fact they are divisions each with its own leader that focus philanthropy on a range of causes including global warming the clinton climate initiative food and health care for povertystricken africans the clinton development initiative sustainable small businesses the clinton giustra enterprise partnership infant and toddler health too small to fail and rebuilding the haitian economy and infrastructure the clinton foundation in haiti the glue that has held this together is president clinton who created the charity in  its first task was to raise funds for his presidential library and who now presides over the annual threeday gathering of his pet project the clinton global initiative in midtown manhattan the conference which shuts down traffic as thoroughly as the general assembly of the united nations because it features equally noteworthy speakers from around the globe brings together cgi members who pay a  yearly membership fee to get a seat at the table with other corporations ngos notforprofits and governments that want to partner and commit to solving specific global problemscgi is a creature that only a character like bill clinton could create with conferences and events around the year it is his perpetual cocktail party his rolodex brought to vivid brilliant life “cgi combines all the things that the press and all of us love money celebrity and doing good” says brad smith president of the foundation center a nonforprofit information source on philanthropy put another way says one democratic consultant “he gets the ceo of cocacola in the room and says ‘you can help distribute medicine in tanzania’ everybody does it because everyone does what bill clinton says it’s like he has this magic wand” it is a unique construction designed to generate real good cgi has helped create  billion of pledges to  philanthropic projects around the globe at cgi events the locus of power is constantly shifting between chelsea and her parentsphotograph by melissa goldenenter chelsea when she arrived in  she knew her primary role was to apply the datadriven skills she had developed in her other jobs to an organization that had long outgrown its startuplike infrastructure “my father has always been such a doer he had never focused on ensuring that we had the functions that not only enabled other doers to focus on doing but also to help us keep systematic track of all the work that was being done” she says the foundation had more than  employees in  countries but its backoffice support had fallen behind there was little collaboration between initiatives employees were focused on the work but there was no unified system to report measure or assess the impact there wasn’t even a comprehensive database that housed the hundreds of projects the foundation was working onfurthermore according to lengthy articles in the new york times and the new republic there was considerable internal strife the stories paint a picture of an organization mismanaged by old clinton insiders including the president’s longtime adviser doug band who allegedly had been exploiting his access to the former president causing conflictofinterest issues within cgi band is no longer at the foundation after the article came out president clinton told cbs this morning that he is “very grateful” for all the fundraising band had done for the foundationadvertisementunderstandably this isn’t a past anyone at the foundation really wants to discuss cgi ceo and former goldman sachs investment banker bob harrison denies outright that there were ever any issues “i don’t think there’s ever been organizational chaos in my experience at cgi” he snapped defensively when i asked him about the stories telling me also that “she chelsea has not impacted the organization of cgi and cgi has not in my experience been in any state of disarray” and when i ask chelsea herself to give me an assessment of the state of the foundation when she arrived the former mckinsey consultant fails to mention any of these problems and she doesn’t bring up the audit she and her father commissioned that year to analyze the foundation’s health until i explicitly ask her about it she is her parents’ daughter after all during interviews her crystalclear thinking is accompanied by a healthy bit of deft stonewallingbut when you look closely you find myriad ways chelsea has been reorganizing this foundation that supposedly has never been in “disarray” of the three clintons she is the one who’s most handson she is also the only one whom staffers actually address by name bill and hillary are “the president” and “the secretary” bill spends much of his time traveling around the globe collecting checks from speeches at a rate as high as  per minute hillary who has used the foundation as a refuge since her resignation as secretary of state will presumably be on the road again working to get into the white house so the onus is on chelsea to help shift the foundation from a starpowered charity into a sophisticated datadriven sustainable organization that can thrive for decades to come “you can’t measure everything” says chelsea “but you can measure almost everything through quantitative or qualitative means so that we know what we’re disproportionately good at and candidly what we’re not so good at so we can stop doing that and double down on what we’re particularly disproportionately good at”slowly she is turning the clinton foundation into a more entrepreneurial enterprise “many of the initiatives of the foundation were in silos” says cgi’s deputy director ed hughes “the president was happy to see each succeed on its own but he did not necessarily appreciate them as a more comprehensive connection of opportunities” when chelsea arrived some cgi employees worked out of the president’s office in harlem others operated out of midtown and the rest were headquartered in downtown manhattan to incite collaboration chelsea insisted on a consolidation which occurred last year bringing all three offices into one midtown location this january chelsea created a new position that sits across all nine initiatives julie guariglia the newinitiative liaison compiles lengthy biweekly reports that alert workers at all the divisions of potential overlap and suggests possible connections between initiatives in the works is a database that will finally give employees access to data on all of the foundation’s activities “chelsea’s brought a willingness to invest in the product” says hughes “i think she’s recognized–maybe it’s her background in management consulting–you need to spend money to make money”chelsea is also reshaping the way the foundation chooses the issues it wants to attack “sometimes president clinton simply would come in and say ‘you know i had a great conversation with the king of jordan we should do something about jordan’ and it would be like well now we’ll make jordan a priority” explains hughes chelsea on the other hand “wants to see some evidence of why we’re making decisions as opposed to the anecdotes” adds hughes chelsea especially wants the foundation to address concerns that have in her words “existed too long in the shadows that historically have made people uncomfortable” two projects ensuring that the juvenile justice system offers healthy food and combatting childhood diarrheatrying to give causes like these a new prominence is where chelsea’s celebrity and political heritage are strategic weapons within the foundation she has steered the alliance for a healthier generation a partnership with the american heart association to train juvenile detention facilities to collectively bargain for healthier food but the foundation can’t drive this alone so she’s also pushing for national standards according to chelsea the week before our second interview “i did a foundation fundraiser in connecticut and senator blumenthal came i beelined for him because he’s on the judiciary committee” she admits “he’s really interested in prison reform” cgi’s bob harrison right is one of eight ceos at the clinton foundation “cgi has not been in any state of disarray” he saysphotograph by melissa goldenin  chelsea pushed the clinton health access initiative which had historically focused on driving down the prices of hiv and aids vaccines to do the same for zincors the leading treatment for diarrhea which is the secondleading killer of children under  years old in the developing world one of the first countries it targeted was nigeria but negotiating with the government ngos publicsector organizations pharma companies and others threatened to endlessly delay the effort according to guariglia the team asked chelsea if she “could facilitate it–get the right players at the table get them to commit to this program” after a couple of weeks of intense preparation chelsea traveled to nigeria and “went around to every partner knew exactly what we needed from them pledged her support and belief in this program and got them to commit” says guariglia her academic work she’s finishing her phd in global health governance armed her with the ability to talk about the issues and she was able to get each player to understand how their role was important in the bigger picture “without her it would have taken months of meetings” says guariglia prices of zincors have been cut by  to  in kenya nigeria and ugandaadvertisement“celebrate those who have the courage to be second” says chelsea “because i do think that often there is this claustrophobic pressure to innovate”chelsea’s most significant impact on the foundation’s longterm credibility is through the work she has done on her father’s signature initiative cgi she is trying to bring in younger members hoping to “democratize” its commitments through a more sophisticated online platform and doing everything she can to ensure that cgi can measure its actual impact when the organization was created in  it was highly forgiving of its members almost half are corporations which regularly lap up tons of press with headlinegrabbing declarations and are rarely held accountable on the other end “the idea was that we were going to be a platform that allows a thousand flowers to bloom without judgment” says cgi’s hughes “we basically celebrated the effort if not the achievement” but when chelsea arrived she started asking questions about the actual results so now the entire organization is undergoing an impact audit of its  commitments the results so far according to cgi ceo harrison suggest that in the organization’s first decade  commitments have been completed “but” he adds “then there are the  that are in the category of ongoing not every one of those we have a high level of confidence in where they stand” those deemed failures would be removed from the portfolio albeit with no real consequence or public shaming “we’re not a lawenforcement organization” says harrison nevertheless says hughes “it is very clear that at whatever point the book on cgi is written it will need to reference whether what people got up and said they were going to do actually happened and whether it made a difference”this impact audit is part of a larger effort to transform cgi into a smart accountable and sustainable support system for philanthropic disrupters around the world cgi now has  working sessions a year where members and potential members can meet brainstorm and come up with ways to collaborate the datagathering exercise will help cgi learn what works best so it can help members shape more effective commitments in the future so far cgi has learned that commitments are more successful when there’s a three to fiveyear goal that is made by a group of organizations together versus a single one that’s the kind of learning that excites a data geek like chelsea she wants to see more groups make commitments that build on proven success versus always feeling like they need to blaze a new trail “celebrate those who have the courage to be second” says chelsea “because i do think that often there really is this claustrophobic pressure to innovate instead of to adapt”on a blindingly snowy morning in febru­ary chelsea clinton takes the stage of a packed nyu auditorium along with the women married to the world’s two most powerful bills melinda gates and hillary clinton–along with chelsea–are there to announce no ceilings a new collaboration between the clinton foundation and the gates foundation that will use data to analyze the progress of women and girls globally while the three chairs onstage are intended to appear egalitarian it quickly becomes apparent that here chelsea will function as a glorified vanna white she politely tees up questions for the two and melts into the backdrop when her mother cuts her off chelsea clinton speaking at a clinton global initiative event in february she’s always been “a person who wanted to fix improve expand things”photograph by melissa goldenit’s a sharp contrast to her appearance one week later at cgi’s annual winter meeting in front of several hundred people she displays all the earmarks of a natural leader command of the subject matter passion that feels authentic and offthecuff comments spliced in with academic favorites such as gestalt and milieu she even displays an edgy wit during a qa session she shares with harrison who mentions that in bill’s harlem office he drank purified water from one of cgi’s developingworld commitments and jokes “i’m alive today” chelsea as if compensating for an embarrassing uncle chides “you’re more than alive thankfully”advertisementthe more her handlers try to ensure a narrative that chelsea is her own person the more they remind you that she is also part of a machinethis day is clearly chelsea’s operation that is it’s clear until an hour later when halfway through a discussion she’s leading on elephant poaching the conference room doors open two secret service men appear and chelsea’s father attempts to slip in quietly by the time the former president sits down at the table reaching for a cookie and a diet coke the gravity in the room has shifted the ebb and flow of power changes depending on which and how many clintons are in a particular space at any given momentthere was a time when hillary was defined by her husband chelsea’s challenge is to work within a clinton enterprise without being solely defined by her parents the clinton machine makes this a particularly daunting task chelsea is as forwardthinking and openminded as any silicon valley entrepreneur of her generation but none of those folks is surrounded by the suffocating retinue that envelopes her public life chelsea’s handlers are likely auditioning for white house gigs should hillary become president and they bring to their current jobs all the paranoia that may serve them well in washington one repeatedly urges chelsea not to change her facial expression during the cover shoot for this issue standing so close that it’s a miracle the staffer’s mug isn’t on the cover alongside chelsea’s another sits in on her interviews holding an iphone like a stopwatch “you have two minutes” whisks her away when she’s in the middle of answering one final question and scolds this journalist for even mentioning doug band’s name in chelsea’s presence it’s all an odd occasionally funny blend of control and confusion their fourpage press release pointing to chelsea’s impact at the foundation only obfuscates her true accomplishments by mentioning such ephemera as visiting rural myanmar “where she delivered the sixbillionth liter of clean water to a family” or “a starkey hearing foundation event in uganda where chelsea helped fit patients for hearing aids” one handler explains that “cgi america is the project chelsea’s least involved in” while another insists that the division’s upcoming june conference is really chelsea’s comingout partythe more they try to ensure a narrative that chelsea is her own person the more they remind you that she is also part of a machine perhaps this is the way of washington but it’s not the way of the entrepreneurial culture she supposedly is embracing “we see it as different things–the foundation cgi running for office hillary’s book these trips” says a democratic consultant “it’s all one thing it’s all the family capital t capital f”the family will almost surely call on chelsea for a favor in  assuming hillary does again run for the presidency in the  campaign chelsea’s smart lively and engaged appearances helped younger voters feel connected to her thenyearold mother amie parnes coauthor of the recent new york times best seller hrc state secrets and the rebirth of hillary clinton is convinced chelsea will take an even more formal role in her mother’s next run “i can see her being a senior adviser” she says “you can see it already she and her mom are working on these issues together–elephant poaching women and girls something her mom learned last time was that there was arrogance at the top she wasn’t hearing the truth from people and chelsea will give her the truth”advertisementthe lines are blurring even now as her profile grows bigger in march she visited jimmy fallon’s tonight show the web series mondays with marlo thomas and south by southwest not exactly her typical academic or humanitarian backdrop where she told an audience of  about how technology can be used for social change sure the sxsw speech could further chelsea’s goal of winning over developers who can create quick and cheap apps in service of the foundation’s efforts in the developing world but it also doesn’t hurt that she is starting to connect to the young technologyfriendly voters hillary lost to obama the last time around assuming chelsea gets very active in hillary  her presence at the foundation will have to go to the back burner in addition to the allencompassing nature of a campaign under tax and electioncampaign laws a charity like the clinton foundation is prohibited from being involved in campaigning so explains leslie lenkowsky professor of practice in public affairs and philanthropy at indiana university if chelsea were traveling on behalf of the foundation and made a pit stop to give a hillary campaign speech “not one drop of money from the foundation can make its way to her campaign not even a xerox or cup of coffee it becomes very very tricky”where this might lead after  is already a matter of much anticipation burberry ceo christopher bailey a close friend of chelsea’s says “i’m sure the foundation will always be part of her life but i don’t know if it will be the only part of her life i certainly do not think she’s come to the conclusion that this is it” hrc‘s parnes predicts chelsea will ultimately end up in politics “i could see her running for congress in new york in  years” she says “she has the clinton name she has the chops and she’s really smart and savvy nothing will hold her back” in that scenario you could look at the clinton foundation in manhattan where chelsea lives with mezvinsky in a  million apartment as the perfect perch for chelsea to prove her command of a wide range of vital global issues politics is inextricably in the fabric of her being in her bloodline and her breeding “people were always asking me since i was a kid ‘do you want to go into politics’ ” she tells me her long bony fingers and rounded features reminiscent of her father’s “and for so long the answer was just a visceral no not because i had made any conscientious deliberate decision but since people had been asking for as long as literally i could remember it was no” photograph by peter hapak“people were always asking me ‘do you want to go into politics’ ” says chelsea “for so long the answer was just a visceral no”it’s less visceral now as chelsea told fast company at sxsw she’s now willing to leave the door open a crack “i live in a city and a state and a country where i support my elected representatives if at some point that weren’t the case and i didn’t support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congresswoman or either of my senators–and i’m lucky to live in a state where i have lots of women representing me you know–maybe then i’d have to ask and answer the question for myself and come to a different answer”this is a person who will have a significant impact on the society around us whether she operates within or outside of politics chelsea characterizes her career before the foundation as something like an act of rebellion she’s grown up and in her midthirties seems to have grown comfortable with her dual role as clinton scion and selfdefining adult it’s an accommodation almost all of us make at some pointadvertisementduring one of our interviews chelsea tells me the story of her discovery of coffee which she like many a millennial deems a signature life event back in  when chelsea was a high school junior and her father was in his first term in the white house a starbucks opened near the ballet school she attended for a couple of hours every afternoon one day she walked in with a friend and she recalls “i just had one of those moments where i was like how have i not had coffee before in my life i love the way it tastes i love the smell i love the ambience”“were your parents coffee drinkers” i ask“my dad had always been a big decaf coffee drinker but my mom had always been more of a tea drinker so i grew up
