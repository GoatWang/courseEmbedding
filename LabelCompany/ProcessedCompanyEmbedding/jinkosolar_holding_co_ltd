recognition of jinkosolars brand and high quality products and services to increase our market share and capture new opportunities during the quarter our gross margin contracted to  from  last quarter as a result of a slight decline in the average selling prices asp of solar modules increased silicon prices and material costs caused by a shortage of supply in the first quarter we believe our margins have room to improve in the second quarter and throughout the second half of the year as our mono wafer and perc cell capacity increases and polysilicon prices stabilize demand in china remains strong with growth momentum expected to continue into the next quarter while the june  feedintariff has created some uncertainties in chinas utilityscale market we havent seen demand weaken our deep involvement in the top runner and pv poverty alleviation projects as well as distributed generation projects will provide strong support for demand during the second half of the year we strongly oppose the petition under section  in the us but believe growth momentum there will continue asps of solar modules in the us have risen slightly in recently months due to strong demand demand from india and other emerging markets where we are devoting more resources to expand our leading market share also continue to grow rapidly with such strong demand from across the globe we expect module shipments to increase by approximately  sequentially in the second quarter of  we continue to ramp up our mono wafer and perc cell capacity which will reduce the overall cost of our mono products and help increase our margins our mono perc products are in short supply and have been fully booked out for the rest of the year demonstrating the strong demand for our high quality products in the meanwhile our team is working hard to optimize the cost structure of both our mono and multi products while we are facing some shortterm industry headwinds the continued development of the
