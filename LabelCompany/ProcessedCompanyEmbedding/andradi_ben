conference report people first plc by ben andradi and stratford caldecott published in the tablet on  businesses badly need values can catholic social teaching supply them company directors meeting recently at worth abbey believe so how do leaders of large global businesses who are also catholics make sense of their world of work in the light of their faith how can they integrate their faith and their work experience can catholic social teaching actually be applied to the way modern businesses and organisations work these were the key questions behind a con ference organised by business leaders and bishops at worth abbey in west sussex last month leadership as if faith mattered was convened by the bishop of arundel and brighton kieran conry who sits on the bishops’ world of work committee and hosted by the abbot of worthchristopher jamison osb abbot christopher who believes the ancient rule of st benedict is a rich source of inspiration for the modern manager led the regular sessions oflectio divina – readings of scripture in the monastic tradition the first speaker was sr helen alford op from the angelicum university in rome coauthor with michael j naughton of managing as if faith mattered she drew on the idea of the level  executive who transcends mere leadership an idea developed by jim collins wwwjimcollinscom the level  executive the one who makes his or her company great is humble yet fearless he takes responsibility for the mistakes of the company but not its successes attributing those to others or to luck he or she normally grows up within the com pany instead of being headhunted from outside he or she genuinely puts the company first in other words and does not simply make use of it to further personal ends such a manager plays something of a christlike role within the company at least relative to the other members of the business this is a leader who takes the company’s sins on himself and transforms them for the good of the company redemption sr helen went on to explore the concept of the virtuous manager and the relationship between ethics and success in a fallen world from a catholic ethical perspective it is important for both ends and means to be virtuous is the product serving the common good is it being produced in a way that furthers the common good in the catholic social tradition human beings are not means to an end but ends in themselves they are persons a term derived from trinitarian theology which speaks of god as one substance but three persons persons are not just individuals but constituted in part by their relationships to others persons working together in a company do not create a machine but a community the common good is the nexus or fruit of these relationships within a community thus the level  executive is the one who is serving the common good of the company and the wider community sr helen concluded arie de geus the former head of group planning for the royal dutchshell group and author of the bestseller the living company reported that a shell survey had discov ered a total of  companies in the world that have sur vived for more than  years in one case for as many as  years all these companies that had stood the test of time shared four characteristics first they were all conservative in financing they preferred money in the pocket second they were outwardlooking sensitive to and engaged with the world around them third they had a sense of cohesion and company identity with clear values aims and principles and saw their organisation as a living community lastly their leaders were tolerant – delegating authority and leaving space for others to flourish without losing control most existing companies are not like this and survive for decades at best rather than centuries research in fact shows that the average lifespan of companies is in steep decline de geus noted his conclusion was radical business schools and conventional economics are killing companies by defining their purpose as the maximisation of shareholder value – increasing the price of product that the market will stand in relation to cost in terms of land labour and capital he reinforced this by reference to research by jim collins reported in another book built to last which showed that companies which do not put profit at the top of their list of priorities were actually  times more profitable over a year period than companies which did profit he concluded should be regarded much like oxygen as necessary for life but not the reason for which we are living the second chapter of st benedict’s rule quoting matthew  agrees strive first for the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will given to you as well de geus is not a catholic but he sees the catholic church as a natural ally in his campaign for the revision of company law since the nineteenth century shareholders have had the power because they supply the capital but this is no longer a world of scarce capital he said and so the maximisation of capital should no longer be the criterion of success the more important criteria should be the flourishing of the people in the business – their talent loyalty creativity and so on – as well as the quality of the product in the long run this reorientation of business to people first plc ben andradi and stratford caldecott gk chesterton centre for faith and culture oxford  put human capital at the centre should ensure a more sustainable economic system he argued the third main speaker was the young chairman of bren ninkmeijer family enterprises which owns the ca textile giant catholic social teaching saidmaurice brennink meijer is the only coherent holistic integrated frame work for viewing the quality of man’s relationships with his world it can be used to identify both how the world ought to be and how to get there the servantleader model helps others move up the pyramid from a concern with mere survival to assuredness communication recognitionprestige and creativity – a pyramid roughly equivalent to collins’s five levels brenninkmeijer had good advice of his own the central values in business should be trust and truth he said while virtuous companies value profitability they value other things more the goal of good leadership is to kindle the soft flame of wanting to be better to be virtu ous was to act as though one loved faith was a source of strength in learning to love and he quoted former president harry s truman there is no limit to what you can achieve provided you don’t mind who gets the credit this meeting of highlevel business executives was im pressive in its radicalism they saw business as a vocation and their leadership roles as a great calling far from aligning with the conventional wisdom of the business schools they were attempting to bring the humanistic and personalistic principles of their faith to bear on the way they did business they saw the need of these principles more than ever in the current world of business shaken and unsure in the wake of the enron and parmalat scan dals fatcat salaries lack of integrity and trust in business had tarnished the image of business and had led to prestigious management journals asking themselves what businesses are for this is the time in other words for christians to provide some unique insights and leadership in this area we are already planning another conference for next year ben andradi is ceo of a european technology company stratford caldecott is director of the chesterton institute for faith and culture in oxford

btopenworld  httpwwwbtopenworldcouk for pr enquiries richardleonhardlefevrecouk by felix bopp posted on july   page  bookmarkshare email printdigg tweet btopenworld is bts new high growth mass market internet business focused increasingly on broadband services btopenworld is essentially an isp but with content that is designed to work with btopenworld the technology used by bt is adsl adsl stands for asymmetric digital subscriber line it transforms the twisted copper pairs of wires between the local telephone exchange and your telephone socket into a highspeed digital line it is called asymmetric because it moves data more quickly from the exchange to you than vice versa this makes it ideal for applications where you would typically receive more data than you transmit such as the reception of digital audiovisual material compared to narrowband broadband is up to times faster always connected offers varied portal content home and business services use of phone while surfing unlimited usage at a flat fee video rich contentstreamingmediacom the next wave internet is getting ready for launch btopenworld in the uk are in a unique position to facilitate for broadband mobile computing and also to offer personalized services what can we expect from this extraordinary portalben andradi we will offer our customers compelling content and an easy to use intuitive portal delivered with high standards of customer service and technical quality we will price market and rollout services aggressively we are currently working with companies to offer the best in broadband content and have more than  content deals in place with a number of content providers covering everything from auctions to zoology you will be able to buy cars find jobs play interactive games watch movies and keep up with the latest national and international news content providers signed up so far include blockbuster carlton online rapido tv pearson television itn cartoon network and the internet movie database so for example with a service such as the internet movie database the website you would look at with a modem is mainly text based but on broadband the focus is geared much more to providing high quality streaming video with crystal clear stereo soundq new media content providers were obviously longing for the time after narrowband you are concentrating on broadband specific content what makes this more exciting than narrowband or tv contenta the opportunities for delivering content on broadband are huge the major advantage over narrowband is speed with broadband delivering large files such as audio and video clips is simple and fast live streaming of video also becomes viable with broadband the current capabilities are just the tip of the iceberg as the speed increases even more over time the opportunities will become phenomenalq how do btopenworld attract big content providersa content providers see broadband our mobile internet and our personal btopenworld as a very powerful proposition what they like is the ability to give us one load of content that comes out via a multiplicity of devices the ability to approach a content provider and propose to distribute their content via the range of devices that we own is a very powerful propositionq whats the timeframe in rolling out all these services when do you reach ‘mainland europe and do you have any plans to enter the us marketa at this time we have rolled out to  exchanges covering approx  of the uk see httpwwwbtcombroadbandfor the latest details of the rollout we believe that the takeup of broadband once people see how it completely transforms their online experience will be very rapid it is however a completely new service so absolute numbers and market share especially as this is also dependant on the marketing activities of our competitors are impossible to estimate accurately btopenworld will enter attractive second wave markets around the world deploying skills
