portfolio principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes in common stocks of smallcapitalization companies the fund will provide shareholders with at least  days prior notice of any change in this investment policy      of  for this fund the subadviser “subadviser” defines smallcapitalization companies as companies that are included in the sp smallcap  ® index or the russell  ® index at the time of purchase or if not included in either index have market capitalizations that fall within the range of the market capitalizations of companies included in the sp smallcap  ® index or the russell  ® index the market capitalization of companies within the sp smallcap  ® index and the russell  ® index will change with market conditions the market capitalization range of companies in the sp smallcap  ® index as of june   ranged from  million to  billion the market capitalization range of companies in the russell  ® index as of june   ranged from  million to  billion the fund may also invest in real estaterelated securities including real estate investment trusts the fund may invest in derivative instruments including but not limited to put and call options the fund typically uses derivative instruments to seek to reduce exposure to other risks such as currency risk to substitute for taking a position in the underlying asset andor to seek to enhance returns in the fund the fund may also invest to a limited extent in foreign stocks the fund may invest in other investment companies including exchangetraded funds to the extent permitted under the investment company act of  as amended and the rules regulations and exemptive orders thereunder “ act” in managing the fund the subadviser invests in stocks that it believes have the potential for longterm growth as well as those that appear to be trading below their perceived value the subadviser uses internally developed quantitative computer models to evaluate financial and fundamental characteristics  eg  changes in earnings return on equity and price to equity multiples of over  companies the subadviser analyzes these characteristics in an attempt to identify companies whose perceived value is not reflected in the stock price considers the potential of each company to create or take advantage of unique product opportunities its potential to achieve longterm sustainable growth and the quality of its management the subadviser may sell securities for a variety of reasons such as to secure gains limit losses or redeploy assets into opportunities believed to be more promising among others the fund may lend portfolio securities on a shortterm or longterm basis up to    ⁄   of its total assets principal risks you could lose money on an investment in the fund any of the following risks among others could affect fund performance or cause the fund to lose money or to underperform market averages of other funds company the price of a company’s stock could decline or underperform for many reasons including among others poor management financial problems reduced demand for company goods or services regulatory fines and judgments or business challenges if a company declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent its stock could become worthless currency to the extent that the fund invests directly in foreign nonus currencies or in securities denominated in or that trade in foreign nonus currencies it is subject to the risk that those foreign nonus currencies will decline in value relative to the us dollar or in the case of hedging positions that the us dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged by the fund through foreign currency exchange transactions derivative instruments derivative instruments are subject to a number of risks including the risk of changes in the market price of the underlying securities credit risk with respect to the counterparty risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates and liquidity and volatility risk the amounts required to purchase certain derivatives may be small relative to the magnitude of exposure assumed by the fund therefore the purchase of certain derivatives may have an economic leveraging effect on the fund and exaggerate any increase or decrease in the net asset value derivatives may not perform as expected so the fund may not realize the intended benefits when used for hedging purposes the change in value of a derivative may not correlate as expected with the currency security or other risk being hedged when used as an alternative or substitute for direct cash investments the return provided by the derivative may not provide the same return as direct cash investment in addition given their complexity derivatives expose the fund to the risk of improper valuation foreign investments investing in foreign nonus securities may result in the fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of us companies due to smaller markets differing reporting accounting and auditing standards nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation foreign currency fluctuations currency blockage or replacement potential for default on sovereign debt or political changes or diplomatic developments which may include the imposition of economic sanctions or other measures by the united states or other governments and supranational organizations markets and economies throughout the world are becoming increasingly interconnected and conditions or events in one market country or region may adversely impact investments or issuers in another market country or region growth investing prices of growth stocks are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company’s growth potential and may fall quickly and significantly if investors suspect that actual growth may be less than expected there is a risk that funds that invest in growthoriented stocks may underperform other funds that invest more broadly growth stocks tend to be more volatile than value stocks and may underperform the market as a whole over any given time period investment model a manager’s proprietary model may not adequately allow for existing or unforeseen market factors or summary prospectus  voya small company fund  of  the interplay between such factors funds that are actively managed in whole or in part according to a quantitative investment model can perform differently from the market as a whole based on the investment model and the factors used in the analysis the weight placed on each factor and changes from the factors’ historical trends issues in the construction and implementation of the investment models including for example data problems andor software issues may create errors or limitations that might go undetected or are discovered only after the errors or limitations have negatively impacted performance there is no guarantee that the use of these investment models will result in effective investment decisions for the fund liquidity if a security is illiquid the fund might be unable to sell the security at a time when the fund’s manager might wish to sell or at all further the lack of an established secondary market may make it more difficult to value illiquid securities exposing the fund to the risk that the price at which it sells illiquid securities will be less than the price at which they were valued when held by the fund the prices of illiquid securities may be more volatile than more liquid investments the risks associated with illiquid securities may be greater in times of financial stress the fund could lose money if it cannot sell a security at the time and price that would be most beneficial to the fund market stock prices may be volatile or have reduced liquidity in response to real or perceived impacts of factors including but not limited to economic conditions changes in market interest rates and political events stock markets tend to be cyclical with periods when stock prices generally rise and periods when stock prices generally decline any given stock market segment may remain out of favor with investors for a short or long period of time and stocks as an asset class may underperform bonds or other asset classes during some periods additionally legislative regulatory or tax policies or developments in these areas may adversely impact the investment techniques available to a manager add to costs and impair the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objectives other investment companies the main risk of investing in other investment companies including exchangetraded funds “etfs” is the risk that the value of the securities underlying an investment company might decrease shares of investment companies that are listed on an exchange may trade at a discount or premium from their net asset value you will pay a proportionate share of the expenses of those other investment companies including management fees administration fees and custodial fees in addition to the expenses of the fund the investment policies of the other investment companies may not be the same as those of the fund as a result an investment in the other investment companies may be subject to additional or different risks than those to which the fund is typically subject real estate companies and real estate investment trusts “reits” investing in real estate companies and reits may subject the fund to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate including losses from casualty or condemnation changes in local and general economic conditions supply and demand market interest rates zoning laws regulatory limitations on rents property taxes and operating expenses in addition to terrorist attacks war or other acts that destroy real property investments in reits are affected by the management skill and creditworthiness of the reit the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of expenses including management fees paid by each reit in which it invests securities lending securities lending involves two primary risks “investment risk” and “borrower default risk” when lending securities the fund will receive cash or us government securities as collateral investment risk is the risk that the fund will lose money from the investment of the cash collateral received from the borrower borrower default risk is the risk that the fund will lose money due to the failure of a borrower to return a borrowed security securities lending may result in leverage the use of leverage may exaggerate any increase or decrease in the net asset value causing the fund to be more volatile the use of leverage may increase expenses and increase the impact of the fund’s other risks smallcapitalization company investments in smallcapitalization companies may involve greater risk than is customarily associated with larger more established companies due to the greater business risks of a limited operating history small size limited markets and financial resources narrow product lines less management depth and more reliance on key personnel the securities of smaller companies are subject to liquidity risk as they are often traded overthecounter and may not be traded in volume typical on a national securities exchange value investing securities that appear to be undervalued may never appreciate to the extent expected further because the prices of valueoriented securities tend to correlate more closely with economic cycles than growthoriented securities they generally are more sensitive to changing economic conditions such as changes in market interest rates corporate earnings and industrial production the manager may be wrong in its assessment of a company’s value and the securities the fund holds may not reach their full values a particular risk of the fund’s value approach is that some holdings may not recover and provide the capital growth anticipated or a security judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced the market may not favor valueoriented securities and may not favor equities at all during those periods the fund’s relative performance may suffer there is a risk that funds that invest in valueoriented stocks may underperform other funds that invest more broadly an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance

new expense limitation agreements would become effective on the date that ing pilgrim becomes adviser to the aetna funds subject to shareholder approval under the proposed agreements ing pilgrim would be responsible for the cost of the expense limits and would be entitled to receive any potential recoupment specifically ing pilgrim would assume other expenses so that the total annual ordinary operating expenses of the fund which excludes interest taxes brokerage commissions and other investmentrelated costs extraordinary expense such as litigation other expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the funds business and expenses of any counsel or other persons or services retained by the directors who are not interested persons as defined in the  act of ing pilgrim do not

for instance extraordinary expenses and the expenses of counsel to the independent directors are covered in the expenses that aeltus may bear if expenses exceed prescribed limits under the current arrangements however these expenses would not be covered by ing pilgrim under the proposed arrangements moreover the current arrangements for the aetna funds do not include recoupment whereas the proposed management agreements contain recoupment provisions under the recoupment provision each fund will within  years of any waiver or expense assumption by ing pilgrim reimburse ing pilgrim for management fees waived and other expenses assumed but only if after such reimbursement the funds expense ratio does not exceed the applicable percentage limitation what is expected to happen to the expenses of the funds ing pilgrim has advised the board that if the measures are approved to effect the proposed integration it expects expense ratios ie the expenses per share to decrease for most of the funds the following chart compares the fees and expenses that the aetna funds currently pay and the fees and expenses it is estimated that the funds would pay upon completion of the integration efforts it is anticipated that the integration measures specifically the use of common service providers would result in greater efficiencies for management and the realization of economies of scale in the operation of the funds this explains the anticipated reduction in total expenses for some of the funds as set forth below the information presented is based on the assumptions that  shareholders approve all proposed management agreements as well as other integration related proposals and  vendors and other service providers provide services to the funds under current fee arrangements in place for the pilgrim funds or under lower fee arrangements that ing pilgrim has negotiated with vendors the proposed expense ratios shown below were provided by ing pilgrim and

their treatment of different series or funds and the classes thereof in other instances the revised charter merely confirms board powers implicit in the existing charter additionally other provisions have been updated to reflect among other things last years acquisition of aeltus by ing and to provide the board with the authority to adopt qualifications in the companys bylaws that would be applicable to and binding upon the current and future directors or any designated subset thereof the latter provision has been added to permit the board to formally adopt a retirement policy in the bylaws pursuant to which an independent directors term of office would end upon reaching a specified age or under other circumstances another amendment is intended to address the fact that maryland law permits a maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision generally limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and the shareholders of the corporation for money damages the existing charter would be further amended to permit the directors subject to applicable law to liquidate a series or class without shareholder approval adoption of the revised
