global inc had its beginnings in milwaukee wisconsin at the time milwaukee was a center of industrial machinery manufacturing at the convergence of three rivers entering lake michigan among the growing number of machinery manufacturing firms in milwaukee in the s was a struggling firm known as the whitehill sewing machine company alonzo pawling and henry harnischfeger managed castings patternmaking and gear machining operations within the whitehill factory concerned that whitehill lacked the marketing and manufacturing discipline needed to grow they formed a machine and pattern shop on december   to manufacture assemble and service components and equipment needed by other larger manufacturing firms in the region alonzo pawling henry harnischfeger joseph francis joy in  pawling and harnischfeger helped rebuild and upgrade an overhead bridge crane within the foundry operations of the edward p allis manufacturing company that had collapsed following an attempt to move a load beyond its rated lifting capacity the rebuilt crane replaced the complex system of ropes and pulleys that failed with a simplified system of motors and gearboxes soon after pawling and harnischfeger began building their own line of overhead cranes for manufacturing and warehouse operations a bank panic in  caused demand to fall for the cranes designed and built by pawling and harnischfeger who were referred to by customers “ph” the partners decided to expand their product line to include earthmoving machines in order to increase their ability to withstand the next economic downturn that same year ph acquired the motors and controls manufacturing assets of the gibb electric company following the acquisition of gibb by westinghouse electric manufacturing company as pawling and harnischfeger wanted greater control over the application of motors applied to their crane line meanwhilewhen in cumberland maryland yearold joseph francis joy went to work as a slate picker in a coal mine eventually working underground with picks handheld drilling augers and shovels to load coal into railmounted cars by  the yearold was learning mechanical engineering via a mailorder course and tinkering with ideas for mechanizing the coalmining process joy’s designs attracted no interest from underground coal mines at first but the pittsburgh coal company in  saw the potential productivity gains that might be obtained by investing in a joy gatheringarm type loader joy obtained a us patent on his device in  and launched joy mining machinery in milwaukee pawling  harnischfeger became known as the harnischfeger corporation following the death of alonzo pawling in  by the mids the firm had become a large and growing supplier of crawlermounted shovels and cranes used in construction and mining operations over the ensuing decades phtrademarked shovels and cranes grew in size capacity and drives and controls technology the firm expanded its product line with the onset of the great depression adding welding machinery diesel engines and prefabricated homes to its ph line of shovels and cranes by the s and s the firm had divested its welding diesel engines and prefabricated homes businesses in order to concentrate on construction and mining machines overhead cranes hoists and material handing systems recessions in the s and s led the firm to shift its strategic focus to include pulp and papermaking machinery and systems and computer systems applied to military and aerospace systems by  the company had evolved into a conglomerate corporation known as harnischfeger industries inc in  harnischfeger acquired the beloit corporation a pulp and papermaking machinery firm and syscon corporation a washington dcbased computer systems supplier in  harnischfeger industries inc bought joy mining machinery for  million joy was a supplier of underground mining equipment based in franklin pennsylvania harnischfeger divested the ph overhead cranes and hoist business in  that business continues with phtrademarked cranes and hoists supplied and supported by morris material handling inc based in oak creek wisconsin in  a currency devaluation crisis in southeast asia led to the collapse of a major paper manufacturing business based in indonesia and the subsequent default on numerous contracts valued in excess of us billion one of those contracts valued in excess of us million was held by harnischfeger industries’ beloit corporation subsidiary as a result harnischfeger industries entered chapter  bankruptcy joy global inc became the direct successor to harnischfeger industries inc upon emergence from the chapter  financial restructuring process on july   joy global would go forward as a supplier of equipment and life cycle management service support solutions for the global mining industry through its subsidiaries ph mining equipment concentrating on surface mining operations and joy mining machinery focusing on underground mining operations profit rose to  million over the next six years in  joy global acquired letourneau technologies the mining equipment and drilling systems business unit of rowan companies inc the acquisition expanded the scope of joy global by adding highcapacity letourneau frontend loaders for mining operations later that year joy global divested the letourneau drilling products business to cameron international corp with the proceeds from that transaction used to acquire chinese mining equipment maker international mining machinery holdings ltd in  joy global acquired a

international mining is one of china’s biggest manufacturers of longwall mining shearers for extracting coal from underground mines acquisition of international mining provided joy global with expanded access to china’s coalmining machinery market later in  joy global acquired an additional  percent of the outstanding shares of international mining contingent on the approval of china’s antimonopoly bureau of the government’s ministry of commerce on  july  komatsu limited agreed to buy joy global inc for  billion or  a share in cash through funds on hand and bank loans  premium over

underground mining machinery for the extraction of coal and other bedded materials including trona and saltcitation needed joy operates major support facilities in australia south africa united kingdom china and the united states with sales offices and service facilities in india poland and russia – all near or within major underground mining regions joy products include continuous miners – electric selfpropelled digging machines that cut material using carbidetipped bits on a horizontal rotating drum longwall shearers – a materialcutting machine that moves back and forth on an armored face conveyor running parallel to the coal or other material being mined using carbidetipped bits on cutting drums at each end the shearer cuts a meter to meter swath of material on each pass of longwall mining and simultaneously loads the material onto a conveyor belt powered roof supports – to provide an open work space shielded against mine roof collapse roof supports use powerful hydraulic cylinders to elevate and hold strong thick steel plates in a horizontal position to protect the longwall shearer and armored face conveyor the supports advance with the longwall shearer and armored face conveyor units resulting in controlled roof falls behind the supports a longwall face may range up to  meters in length armored face conveyors – material handling conveyors that transport material cut by the shearer away from the longwall face shuttle cars – lowprofile electricpowered rubbertire material haulage vehicles that transport up to  metric tons of coal and other material from continuous miners to the main mine runout conveyor belt discharging their material loads with the help of onboard chain conveyors flexible conveyor trains – electricpowered selfpropelled conveyor systems available in lengths up to  feet   meters and capable of being configured into multiple degree turns to help move material out of an underground mine operation roof bolters – drilling rigs that bore holes into an underground mine roof making possible the insertion of long metal bolts to help reinforce the mine roof battery haulers – batterypowered material haulage cars similar to shuttle cars continuous haulage systems – unlike the pulsed batch load throughput made possible by usage of shuttle cars and battery haulers continuous haulage systems feature a connected series of bridge structures that utilize chain conveyors to obtain continuous throughput of material from the mine face to the main mine loadout conveyor belts joy mining machinery operates a global network of service centers and warehouses to help underground mining operations obtain high levels of equipment and mining systems reliability and productivity joy applies a “life cycle management” strategy to

gold phosphates molybdenum and diamond mining operations ph mining products include electric mining shovels – with working weights in excess of  tons   metric tons and powered by electric motors linked to planetary and casetype transmissions ph electric can move up to  tons   metric tons of material every  seconds from the mine face into the waiting tray of a nearby haul truck or inpit crushingconveying system hopper ph shovel dippers range in size from  cubic yards   cubic meters up to  cubic yards   cubic meters blast hole drilling rigs – hard rock formations are typically found within surface mining operations and they must undergo drilling and blasting in order to fragment the rock for easier digging crushing and refining processes within the mine operation ph blast hole drilling rigs apply either electricity or diesel power to obtain three forces needed to advance a tricone drill bit into hard rock “pulldown” or downward bitloading force hightorque rotary force and large volumes of “bailing air” needed to cool the tricone bit and evacuate or push rock chips particles and dust toward the top of the tubular blast hole when a grid of blast holes has been drilled each hole is loaded with explosives and then carefully detonated in order to shatter and fragment the rock formation with a highenergy shock wave drills typically work ahead of advancing shoveltruck fleets in surface mine operations walking draglines – with working weights in excess of  tons   metric tons and powered by large electric motors a dragline excavator rests on large flat cylindrical steel “tubs” and equipped with football fieldlength booms and buckets large enough to hold several sport utility vehicles walking draglines use hoist swing and drag forces to cast their buckets out to the next targeted area from which earth needs to be gathered up and moved they then apply inward “drag” force to quickly load the bucket and then hoist and swing forces to castdump the material onto a nearby spoil pile draglines are used primarily to strip large volumes of overburden away from thick seams of coal they are also a prime mover in phosphate mining operations inpit crushingconveying systems – ph is developing inpit crushingconveying systems that enable shovels to load a mobile mining crusher with material that material is then relayed via a series of conveyors to spoil piles
