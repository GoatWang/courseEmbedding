alpmf holmes osborne value bonds cfa registered investment advisorosborne global investmentssummaryastellas has been increasing sales for yearsthe stock is under followed in the usastellas is a major holding of iva fundsastellas pharma otcpkalpmfotcpkalpmy is a japanese drug maker and a major holding of iva funds the stock is reasonably priced and has been growing sales for several years charles de vaulx recently recommended the stock on wealthtrack the company has  billion shares the stock trades for ¥ and the market cap is ¥ trillion  billion it takes  yen to buy one dollar the dividend is ¥ and the dividend yield is  earnings per ¥ and the price to earnings ratio is  over the last three fiscal years ending in march revenues were ¥ trillion  billion in  ¥ trillion  billion in  and ¥ trillion  billion in  thus far astellas looks like a text book stocktrades at a reasonable price and sales increase every year net income went from ¥ billion  million to ¥ billion  billion over that time frame the balance sheet shows ¥ billion  billion in cash and ¥ billion  billion in receivables the liability side shows ¥ billion  billion in payables and ¥ billion  million in debt bullet proof free cash flow was ¥ billion  billion in  that would be a free cash flow yield of  return on equity was  last year for the first nine months of  sales decreased  because of currencies on a constant currency basis they appreciated  the company has been buying back stock and just authorized a ¥ billion  million buyback according to the annual report  of sales are derived in japan  the americas  europemiddle eastafrica and  asia astellass biggest seller is xtandi used for prostate cancer treatment it can be taken orally eligard and gonax are also used in the treatment of prostate cancer betanismyrbrtiqbetmiga are all used for urinary incontinence there are dozens of drugs focusing on oncology immunology and urology in development what got me interested in astellas was an interview on wealthtrack with charles de vaulx of iva funds iviqx ivwix astellas was his one recommendation he noted that astellas is one of ivas largest holdings that it has tripled in value in five years and that he thinks the stock is as cheap as ever de vaulx noted that management does a good job buying back shares at the right price and that it holds net cash the stock is on sale because it is under followed like most pharmaceutical companies astellas has drugs that will fall off patent xtandi falls off patent in  the company has been using its cash to buy other drugs and partner with biotechs and other pharmas so is the stock a buy let me tell you what i like about astellas the stock is reasonably priced has lots of cash and has been increasing sales if it were based in the us it would trade at a higher level you can tell that management wants to make the stock look appealing the annual report is  pages most japanese annual reports are about  pages they give as little information as possible not astellas it wants to compete with the europeans and us unlike other japanese companies i dont see strange crossholdings with other companies nor a founding family that wants to operate in seclusion my guess is that the stock is down in part over worries about our new president and what hes going to do with healthcare as for the pipeline pharma is not my strong suit so im not going to discuss clinical trials i find the stock to be quite interesting disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this

why does this  billion dollar fund love this energy stock published on september   at  pm by meena krishnamsetty in stock analysis international value advisers managed by charles de vaulx is a new yorkbased fund with an estimated  billion in assets under management the majority of international value’s capital lies in its diversified global strategy fund which prides itself on a “flexible go anywhere approach” to investing since its inception in  the diversified global strategy fund has achieved a  gross return per annum with fees ranging between  to  percentage points in addition to its adaptable strategy de vaulx has a penchant for the valuebased teachings of benjamin graham and david dodd and places a special importance on cash flow valuation without further ado here is the hedge fund manager’s top stock pick as of his second quarter f filing with the sec devon energy corporation nysedvn  accounting for  of de vaulx’s f portfolio devon energy corporation has been a decent investment this summer returning  over the past three months between the first and second quarter de vaulx’s fund increased its ownership of devon energy by an estimated  and its total holdings in the natural gas producer are now worth more than  million international value’s position in devon energy is the largest among the  funds we are tracking with no other fund holding more than  million worth of the stock famed investors jim simons and steven cohen are also bullish holding roughly  million in devon energy shares between them devon energy currently trades at a pricetocash flow multiple x below its industry’s average x and its own year historical average x this valuation is also below many of the company’s competitors including apache corporation nyseapa at x anadarko petroleum corporation nyseapc at x chesapeake energy corporation nysechk at x eog resources inc nyseeog at x and encana corporation nyseeca at x in fact over the past halfdecade devon energy’s cash hoard has traditionally traded at a  discount relative to the sp  this year though it is trading at a much cheaper  discount delving a bit deeper into devon’s cash flows it appears that this undervaluation is not warranted as the energy company has grown its operating cash flow by an average rate of  a year since the recession this year average growth rate is better than many of the company’s peers most notably anadarko petroleum  chesapeake energy  and encana  when this growth is factored into our valuation calculations we can see that devon energy sports a pcfg ratio – which is similar to the peg – of  typically any figure below  signals undervaluation moreover devon’s pcfg is trading at a discount to many of its peers who are cash flow growth positive including apache  chesapeake energy  and eog resources  finally devon energy also provides investors with a solid dividend yield of  and a supportable payout ratio of  this yield is above the likes of apache  anadarko  eog resources  while trailing only chesapeake energy and encana which have dividend yields of  and  respectively as mentioned above charles de vaulx loves this stock and is devon energy’s biggest bull in the hedge fund industry due to the company’s reasonable cash flow valuation and attractive growth history it’s easy to understand why it may be smart for individual investors to consider devon in their portfolios as it usually is a good idea to mimic the world’s most successful money managers for a longer look at the entire hedge fund industry’s sentiment toward devon energy continue reading here related insider

charles de vaulx chief investment officer international value advisers llc ask investors how they define value and you will probably get a variety of answers an “eclectic” assortment as this week’s guest longtime value investor charles de vaulx put it investment styles go in and out of favor an extreme example was during the tech boom when growth was hot investors were willing to pay up if a company had a dot com in its name and revenues were increasing traditional value metrics such as price and earnings didn’t seem to matter until of course they did growth crashed and value took the lead in the s in the slow growth years after the financial crisis growth made a strong comeback and value lagged badly last year it flipped again for the first time in four years value outperformed growth until then selfdescribed value managers have had a tough time beating the overall market and even their benchmark indexes like the russell  value index which are chock full of many lower quality companies that are cheap for good reasons in many cases they are highly leveraged have no earnings or have problems this week’s guest is a selfdescribed value manager with a precise definition of what value means to him and his firm he is charles de vaulx the chief investment officer and coportfolio manager of international value advisers a long only global money management firm he cofounded with charles de lardemelle in  at the beginning of the financial crisis before founding iva both spent many years working with legendary value investor and frequent wealthtrack guest jeanmarie eveillard they manage several portfolios but their major holdings are in two mutual funds their flagship iva worldwide fund and the iva international fund both were closed to new investors in  because they didn’t want them to get too big and felt there were too few opportunities in the market a view they hold today iva worldwide has outperformed its morningstar peer group and market benchmark with less than market risk since inception it has trailed the market in recent years however a fact that does not bother this investor whose goal is absolute returns overall with capital preservation in the short term and market outperformance over a full economic cycle according to de vaulx we are not there yet in the meantime he is holding nearly  of his portfolios in cash in this

their own bridget b hughes  this article first appeared in the februarymarch  issue of morningstar advisor magazine get your free subscription here in just longer than three years international value advisers has amassed more than  billion in assets under management thats quite a feat for a firm known as iva that invests primarily in equities considering the roughandtumble markets that investors have endured during that period its asset figure puts iva among the  largest mutual fund families thus it would be stretching it to call the firm undiscovered especially considering that one of its top investment people charles de vaulx is fairly wellknown among investors thanks in part to his many years managing funds at first eagle both in partnership with valueinvesting legend jeanmarie eveillard and on his own during those years de vaulx established close relationships with many clients and shareholders who appreciated his candor still iva isnt a household name and while you may think you know the firms strategy and management well theres more to tell including the fact that the firm will close its doors to investors on feb  nimble is a sticking pointin some sense iva was born out of necessity in  a group of senior managers and analysts left first eagle leaving were de vaulx chuck de lardemelle who was first eagles director of research simon fenwick analyst and once manager of first eagle gold sggdx and analysts thibaut pizenberg and michael malafronte while the reasons for their departures were varied not surprisingly the story differs somewhat depending on which side you talk to the group had a clear idea of what it wanted for the future having worked well together for a number of years the managers and analysts wanted to stick togetherand importantly to continue to practice the patient and uncommon value approach they had employed on the first eagle funds something that couldnt be taken for granted at other firms so they formed a partnership and launched iva having control over their business was important to the partners no outside investor was invited as a partner they also wanted the ability to close their funds when they saw fit de vaulx had long argued that his approach requires a small and nimble asset base because of regular forays into lessliquid smaller companies and highyield bonds single page shareemail print text size our
