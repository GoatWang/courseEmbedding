case where a bank holding company proposes to i acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other bank ii acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any bank unless it owns a majority of such banks voting shares or iii merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company  the frb will not approve any acquisition merger or consolidation that would have a substantially anticompetitive effect unless the anticompetitive impact of the proposed transaction is clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the

together with the convenience and needs of the community to be served when reviewing acquisitions or mergers   the bhca also generally prohibits a bank holding company with certain limited exceptions from i acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than  of the outstanding voting stock of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company or ii engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking managing or controlling banks or performing services for its subsidiaries unless such nonbanking business is determined by the frb to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto  in making such determinations the frb is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience increased competition or gains in efficiency against the possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources decreased or unfair competition conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices the bhca was substantially amended through the modernization act  the modernization act permits bank holding companies and banks which meet certain capital management and community reinvestment act standards to engage in a broader range of nonbanking activities  in addition bank holding companies which elect to become financial holding companies may engage in certain banking and nonbanking activities without prior frb approval  finally the modernization act imposes certain privacy requirements on all financial institutions and their treatment of consumer information  the company has elected to become a financial holding company   there are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the federal deposit insurance corporation the “fdic” insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default  under regulations of the frb a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy  the frb also has the authority under the bhca to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary upon the frbs determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company   capital adequacy guidelines   in december  and january  the basel committee on banking supervision the “basel committee” published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as “basel iii” in july  the frb the fdic and the comptroller of the currency adopted final rules the “new rules” which implement certain provisions of basel iii and the doddfrank act the new rules replaced the existing general riskbased capital rules of the various banking agencies with a single integrated regulatory capital framework the new rules require higher capital cushions and more stringent criteria for what qualifies as regulatory capital the new rules were effective for the bank and the company on january     under the new rules the company and the bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets   • common equity tier  capital ratio of  the “cet” • tier  capital ratio cet capital plus “additional tier  capital” of  and • total capital ratio tier  capital plus tier  capital of    in addition the company and the bank will be subject to a leverage ratio of  calculated as tier  capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements   the new rules also require a “capital conservation buffer” when fully phased in on january   the company and the bank will be required to maintain a  capital conservation buffer which is composed entirely of cet on top of the minimum riskweighted asset ratios described above resulting in the following minimum capital ratios   • cet of  • tier  capital ratio of  and • total capital ratio of    the purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a cet tier  capital ratio and total capital ratio above the minimum set forth above but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall  the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january   at the  level and it increases by  on each subsequent january  until it reaches  on january     the new rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to cet which are being phased in between january   and january   for example mortgage servicing rights deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from cet to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds  of cet or all such categories in the aggregate exceed  of cet   under the new rules banking organizations such as the company and the bank may make a onetime permanent election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income items in determining regulatory capital ratios effective as of january   the company and the bank elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income items for purposes of determining regulatory capital while the new rules generally require the phaseout of nonqualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock holding companies with less than  billion in total consolidated assets as of december   such as the company may permanently include nonqualifying instruments that were issued and included in tier  or tier  capital prior to may   in additional tier  or tier  capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature   the new rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating riskweighted assets depending on the nature of the assets the risk categories generally range from  for us government and agency securities to  for certain equity exposures and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories in addition the new rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchasestyle transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation   consistent with the doddfrank act the new rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the riskweighting for certain assets   pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  “fdicia” each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations specifying the levels at which an insured depository institution such as the bank would be considered “well capitalized” “adequately capitalized” “undercapitalized” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized” and providing for certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution to qualify to engage in financial activities under the grammleachbliley act all depository institutions must be “well capitalized”   the new rules also revised the regulations implementing these provisions of fdicia to change the capital levels applicable to each designation under the new rules an institution will be classified as “well capitalized” if it i has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least  percent ii has a tier  riskbased capital ratio of at least  percent iii has a tier  leverage ratio of at least  percent iv has a common equity tier  capital ratio of at least  and v meets certain other requirements an institution will be classified as “adequately capitalized” if it i has a total riskbased capital ratio of at least  percent ii has a tier  riskbased capital ratio of at least  percent iii has a tier  leverage ratio of at least  percent iv has a common equity tier  capital ratio of at least  and v does not meet the definition of “well capitalized” an institution will be classified as “undercapitalized” if it i has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than  percent ii has a tier  riskbased capital ratio of less than  percent iii has a tier  leverage ratio of less than  percent or iv has a common equity tier  capital ratio of less than  an institution will be classified as “significantly undercapitalized” if it i has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than  percent ii has a tier  riskbased capital ratio of less than  percent iii has a tier  leverage ratio of less than  percent or iv has a common equity tier  capital ratio of less  an institution will be classified as “critically undercapitalized” if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than  percent an insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating   general bank regulation   as a new jerseychartered commercial bank the bank is subject to the regulation supervision and control of the new jersey department of banking and insurance the “department”  as an fdicinsured institution the bank is subject to regulation supervision and control of the fdic an agency of the federal government  the regulations of the fdic and the department affect virtually all activities of the bank including the minimum level of capital that the bank must maintain the ability of the bank to pay dividends the ability of the bank to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters   insurance of deposits   the doddfrank act has caused significant changes in the fdic’s insurance of deposit accounts among other things the doddfrank act permanently increased the fdic deposit insurance limit to  thousand per depositor   on february   the fdic announced the approval of the assessment system mandated by the doddfrank act  doddfrank required that the base on which deposit insurance assessments are charged be revised from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets  the fdic’s rule to base the assessment on average total consolidated assets minus average tangible equity instead of domestic deposits lowered assessments for many community banks with less than  billion in assets and reduced the company’s costs   dividend rights   under the banking act a bank may declare and pay dividends only if after payment of the dividend the capital stock of the bank will be unimpaired and either the bank will have a surplus of not less than  of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the banks surplus unless and until the company develops other lines of business payments of dividends from the bank will remain the company’s primary source of income and the primary source of funds for dividend payments to the shareholders of the company  doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act   the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” enacted on july   significantly changed the bank regulatory landscape and has impacted and will continue to impact the lending deposit investment trading and operating activities of insured depository institutions and their holding companies the doddfrank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations  the doddfrank act among other things • capped debit card interchange fees for institutions with  billion in assets or more at  plus  basis points times the transaction amount a substantially lower rate than the average rate in effect prior to adoption of the doddfrank act • provided for an increase in the fdic assessment for depository institutions with assets of  billion or more increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the dif from  to  and changes the basis for determining fdic premiums from deposits to assets • permanently increased the deposit insurance coverage to  thousand and allowed depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts • created a new consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad authority to enforce these laws • provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance • changed standards for federal preemption of state laws related to federallychartered institutions and their subsidiaries • provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to repay restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans new disclosures and certain other revisions and • created a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the federal reserve increasingly strict rules for capital leverage liquidity risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity the doddfrank act also imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans such as the bank among other things the doddfrank act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term if the originator cannot meet this standard the mortgage may be unenforceable the doddfrank act contains an exception from this abilitytorepay rule for “qualified mortgages” a rule issued by the cfpb in january  and effective january   sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a qualified mortgage the criteria generally exclude loans that  are interestonly  have excessive upfront points or fees or  have negative amortization features balloon payments or terms in excess of  years the underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of  based upon documented and verifiable information if a loan meets these criteria and is not a “higher priced loan” as defined in frb regulations the cfpb rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer’s ability to repay however a consumer may assert the lender’s failure to comply with the abilitytorepay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than qualified mortgages and may challenge whether a loan in fact qualified as a qualified mortgage although the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the bank would be considered qualified mortgages the bank has and may continue to make residential mortgage loans that would not qualify as a result of such rules the bank might experience increased compliance costs loan losses litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the bank satisfied the abilitytorepay rule upon originating the loan   the requirements of the doddfrank act and other regulatory reforms continue to be implemented  in addition as a result of the  election many commentators believe that some portions of the doddfrank act may be replaced or amended it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact certain provisions and yettobefinalized rules and regulations will have on us including any regulations promulgated by the cfpb financial reform legislation and rules could have adverse implications on the financial industry the competitive environment and our ability to conduct business management will have to apply resources to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions of regulatory reforms including the doddfrank act and any implementing rules which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings b statistical information   the table below provides a crossreference to portions

operations and the trading price of our securities can be materially and adversely affected by many events and conditions including the following   we have been and may continue to be adversely affected by national financial markets and economic conditions as well as local conditions   our business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the united states including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates inflation home prices unemployment and underemployment levels bankruptcies household income consumer spending investor confidence and the strength of the us economy the deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our securities and loan portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses our capital levels liquidity and our results of operations   in addition we are affected by the economic conditions within our new jersey and pennsylvania trade areas  unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in the seven counties in the new jersey market and one county in pennsylvania in which we have branches so any decline in the economy of new jersey or eastern pennsylvania could have an adverse impact on us   our loans the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of collateral securing these loans are impacted by economic conditions   our financial results the credit quality of our existing loan portfolio and the ability to generate new loans with acceptable yield and credit characteristics may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions including declines in real estate values changes in interest rates adverse employment conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  although economic conditions in our primary market have fared better than other areas of the united states we cannot assure you that these conditions will continue to prevail  we cannot assure you that positive trends or developments discussed in this annual report will continue or that negative trends or developments will not have a significant adverse effect on us   a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business   a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate as of december    approximately  percent of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended weakness in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality any future declines in home prices in the new jersey and pennsylvania markets we serve also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios stress in the real estate market combined with any weakness in economic conditions and any future elevated unemployment levels could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses in that event our earnings could be adversely affected   our offering of alternative credit products may expose us to increased lending risks   the doddfrank act imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans among other things the doddfrank act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term if the originator cannot meet this standard the loan may be unenforceable the doddfrank act contains an exception from this abilitytorepay rule for “qualified mortgages” a rule issued by the cfpb in january  and effective january   sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a qualified mortgage the criteria generally exclude loans that  are interestonly  have excessive upfront points or fees or  have negative amortization features balloon payments or terms in excess of  years the underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of  based upon documented and verifiable information if a loan meets these criteria and is not a “higher priced loan” as defined in federal reserve regulations the cfpb rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the originator to establish the consumer’s ability to repay however a consumer may assert the lender’s failure to comply with the abilitytorepay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than qualified mortgages although the majority of residential mortgages historically originated by the bank would be considered qualified mortgages the bank has and may continue to make residential mortgage loans that would not qualify the bank has evaluated the impact of the qualified mortgage definition and related abilitytorepay rules as well as other rules recently issued by the by the cfpb related to mortgage origination and servicing and does not believe it will have any longterm impact on its mortgage loan origination and servicing activities as a result of such rules the bank might experience increased compliance costs loan losses litigation related expenses and delays in taking title to real estate collateral if these loans do not perform and borrowers challenge whether the bank satisfied the abilitytorepay rule upon originating the loan   there is a risk that the sba will not honor their guarantee   the company has historically been a participant in various sba lending programs which guarantee up to  of the principal on the underlying loan there is a risk that the sba will not honor their guarantee if a loan is not underwritten and administered to sba guidelines the company follows the underwriting guidelines of the sba however our ability to manage this will depend on our ability to continue to attract hire and retain skilled employees who have knowledge of the sba program   there is a risk that we may not be repaid in a timely manner or at all for loans we make   the risk of nonpayment or deferred or delayed payment of loans is inherent in commercial banking  such nonpayment or delayed or deferred payment of loans to the company if they occur may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition  additionally in compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations the company maintains an allowance for loan losses created through charges against earnings  as of december    the company’s allowance for loan losses was  million  or   percent of our total loan portfolio and   percent of our nonperforming loans  the company’s marketing focus on small to medium size businesses may result in the assumption by the company of certain lending risks that are different from or greater than those which would apply to loans made to larger companies  we seek to minimize our credit risk exposure through credit controls which include evaluation of potential borrowers’ available collateral liquidity and cash flow  however there can be no assurance that such procedures will actually reduce loan losses   our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses   like all financial institutions we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance  our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the results of our operations  risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by management and periodically by an independent loan review function and by the audit committee  a risk system consisting of multiplegrading categories is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and the appropriate level of loss reserves  along with the risk system management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrowers past and expected loan loss experience and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an adequate reserve  this risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly and as adjustments become necessary they are realized in the periods in which they become known  the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic operating and other conditions including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control and these losses may exceed current estimates  state and federal regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process review our loans and allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses  although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that our regulators will not require us to increase this allowance  either of these occurrences could adversely affect our earnings   we are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance    net interest income the difference between interest earned on our interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities represents a significant portion of our earnings  both increases and decreases in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits   interest rates are subject to factors which are beyond our control including general economic conditions competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies such as the federal reserve board  changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest unity receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i unity’s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of unity’s financial assets and liabilities including the held to maturity and available for sale securities portfolios and iii the average duration of unity’s interestearning assets this also includes the risk that interestearning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interestbearing liabilities or vice versa repricing risk the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interestearning asset and interestbearing liability maturities yield curve risk the banking business is subject to significant government regulations   we are subject to extensive governmental supervision regulation and control these laws and regulations are subject to change and may require substantial modifications to our operations or may cause us to incur substantial additional compliance costs these laws and regulations are designed to protect depositors and the public but not our shareholders  in addition future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the commercial banking industry and our operations  such governing laws can be anticipated to continue to be the subject of future modification  our management cannot predict what effect any such future modifications will have on our operations  in addition the primary focus of federal and state banking regulation is the protection of depositors and not the shareholders of the regulated institutions   for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” has resulted in substantial new compliance costs and may restrict certain sources of revenue the doddfrank act was signed into law on july    generally the act is effective the day after it was signed into law but different effective dates apply to specific sections of the law many of which will not become effective until various federal regulatory agencies have promulgated rules implementing the statutory provisions  uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act which could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole or on our business results of operations and financial condition  the doddfrank act among other things   • capped debit card interchange fees for institutions with  billion in assets or more at  plus  basis points times the transaction amount a substantially lower rate than the average rate in effect prior to adoption of the doddfrank act • provided for an increase in the fdic assessment for depository institutions with assets of  billion or more increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the dif from  to  and changes the basis for determining fdic premiums from deposits to assets • permanently increased the deposit insurance coverage to  thousand and allowed depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts • created a new consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” that has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that apply to all banks and has broad authority to enforce these laws • provided for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance • changed standards for federal preemption of state laws related to federallychartered institutions and their subsidiaries • provided mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer’s ability to repay restricting variable rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans new disclosures and certain other revisions and • created a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the federal reserve increasingly strict rules for capital leverage liquidity risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity   in addition i n order to implement basel iii and certain additional capital changes required by the doddfrank act on july   the frb approved as an interim final rule the regulatory capital requirements for us bank holding companies such as us substantially similar to final rules issued by the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency  these new requirements are likely to increase our capital requirements in future periods see “supervisions and regulation – capital adequacy guidelines”   these provisions as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices including the ability to offer new products obtain financing attract deposits make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs these changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our management is actively reviewing the provisions of the doddfrank act and basel iii many of which are to be phasedin over the next several years and assessing the probable impact on our operations however the ultimate effect of these changes on the financial services industry in general and us in particular is uncertain at this time we are subject to changes in accounting policies or accounting standards   understanding unity’s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our financial results some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results unity has identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses security valuations and impairments goodwill and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain under each of these policies it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions or as new information becomes available   from time to time the fasb and the sec change their guidance governing the form and content of unity’s external financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” such as the fasb sec banking regulators and unity’s outside auditors may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied such changes are expected to continue and may accelerate based on the fasb and international accounting standards board commitments to achieving convergence between us gaap and international financial reporting standards changes in us gaap and changes in current interpretations are beyond unity’s control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how unity reports its financial results and condition in certain cases unity could be required to apply a new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently also retroactively which may result in unity restating prior period financial statements for material amounts additionally significant changes to us gaap may require costly technology changes additional training and personnel and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations   declines in value may adversely impact the investment portfolio   as of december    we had approximately  million and  million in available for sale and held to maturity investment securities respectively we may be required to record impairment charges in earnings related to credit losses on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered otherthantemporary additionally a if we intend to sell a security or b it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis we will be required to recognize an otherthantemporary impairment charge in the statement of income equal to the full amount of the decline in fair value below amortized cost factors including lack of liquidity absence of reliable pricing information adverse actions by regulators or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio and may result in otherthantemporary impairment on our investment securities in future periods   liquidity risk   liquidity risk is the potential that unity will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances   liquidity is required to fund various obligations including credit commitments to borrowers mortgage and other loan originations withdrawals by depositors repayment of borrowings dividends to shareholders operating expenses and capital expenditures   liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention principal and interest payments on loans principal and interest payments on investment securities sale maturity and prepayment of investment securities net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness or downturn in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole   we are in competition with many other banks including larger commercial banks which have greater resources than us   the banking industry within the state of new jersey is highly competitive  the company’s principal market area is also served by branch offices of large commercial banks and thrift institutions  in addition in  the grammleachbliley financial modernization act permits other financial entities such as insurance companies and securities firms to acquire or form financial institutions thereby further increasing competition  a number of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to expend upon advertising and marketing and their substantially greater capitalization enables them to make much larger loans  our success depends a great deal upon our judgment that large and midsize financial institutions do not adequately serve small businesses in our principal market area and upon our ability to compete favorably for such customers  in addition to competition from larger institutions we also face competition for individuals and small businesses from small community banks seeking to compete as “hometown” institutions  most of these smaller institutions have focused their marketing efforts on the smaller end of the small business market we serve future offerings of common stock may adversely affect the market price of our stock   in the future if our or the bank’s capital ratios fall below the prevailing regulatory required minimums we or the bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of common stock or preferred stock additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both   we cannot predict how changes in technology will impact our business   the financial services market including banking services is increasingly affected by advances in technology including developments in   • telecommunications • data processing • automation • internetbased banking • telebanking and • debit cardssmart cards   our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on whether we can anticipate and respond to technological changes  to develop these and other new technologies we will likely have to make additional capital investments  although we continually invest in new technology we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources or access to the necessary proprietary technology to remain competitive in the future   the company’s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security   the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business  any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company’s customerrelationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems     we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us and to the risk that our or our vendors’ business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate we maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including among other things i changes in the vendor’s organizational structure or internal controls ii changes in the vendor’s financial condition iii changes in the vendor’s support for existing products and services and iv changes in the vendor’s strategic focus  in addition we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate against any loss incurred   while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of its information systems there can be no assurance that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed  the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of the company’s information systems could damage the company’s reputation result in a loss of customer business subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the company to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations    our business strategy could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees and manage our expenses   we expect to continue to experience growth in the scope of our operations and correspondingly in the number of our employees and customers  we may not be able to successfully manage our business as a result of the strain on our management and operations that may result from this growth  our ability to manage this growth will depend upon our ability to continue to attract hire and retain skilled employees    our success will also depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational and other systems to manage multiple concurrent customer relationships and to hire train and manage our employees   hurricanes or other adverse weather events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations   hurricanes and other weather events can disrupt our operations result in damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate  in addition these weather events may result in a decline in value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in delinquencies foreclosures and loan losses risk of tax reform on deferred tax assets corporate tax

overall loan portfolio increased  basis points to  percent for the year ended december    compared to  percent for the prior year       sba a loans on which the sba historically has provided guarantees of up to  percent of the principal balance are considered a higher risk loan product for the company  these loans are made for the purposes of providing working capital financing the purchase of equipment inventory or commercial real estate  generally an sba a loan has a deficiency in its credit profile that would not allow the borrower to qualify for a traditional commercial loan which is why the sba provides the guarantee  the deficiency may be a higher loan to value “ltv” ratio lower debt service coverage “dsc” ratio or weak personal financial guarantees  in addition many sba a loans are for start up businesses where there is no historical financial information  finally many sba borrowers do not have an ongoing and continuous banking relationship with the bank but merely work with the bank on a single transaction  the guaranteed portion of the company’s sba loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the nonguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment     sba a loans held for sale carried at the lower of cost or market amounted to  million at december     an increase of  million from december     sba a loans held for investment amounted to  million at december    an increase of  million from  million at december     the yield on sba a loans which are generally floating and adjust quarterly to the prime rate was  percent for the year ended december    compared to  percent in the prior year the guarantee rates on sba a loans range from  percent to  percent with the majority of the portfolio having a guarantee rate of  percent at origination  the guarantee rates are determined by the sba and can vary from year to year depending on government funding and the goals of the sba program  the carrying value of sba loans held for sale represents the guaranteed portion to be sold into the secondary market  the carrying value of sba loans held for investment represents the unguaranteed portion which is the companys portion of sba loans originated reduced by the guaranteed portion that is sold into the secondary market  approximately  million and  million in sba loans were sold but serviced by the company at december   and december    respectively and are not included on the company’s balance sheet  there is no direct relationship or correlation between the guarantee percentages and the level of chargeoffs and recoveries on the company’s sba a loans  chargeoffs taken on sba a loans effect the unguaranteed portion of the loan  sba loans are underwritten to the same credit standards irrespective of the guarantee percentage     the sba  program consists of real estate backed commercial mortgages where the company has the first mortgage and the sba has the second mortgage on the property  generally the company has a  percent ltv ratio on sba  program loans at origination  at december    sba  loans totaled  million  a decrease of  million from  million at december     the yield on sba  loans was  percent for the year ended december    compared to  percent in     commercial loans are generally made in the company’s marketplace for the purpose of providing working capital financing the purchase of equipment inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes  these loans amounted to  million at december    an increase of  million from year end     the yield on commercial loans was  percent for   compared to  percent in     residential mortgage loans consist of loans secured by  to  family residential properties  these loans amounted to  million at december    an increase of  million from year end     sales of mortgage loans totaled  million for    approximately  million of the loans sold were from portfolio with the remainder consisting of new production the yield on residential mortgages was  percent for   compared to  percent for   residential mortgage loans maintained in portfolio are generally to individuals that do not qualify for conventional financing in extending credit to this category of borrowers the bank considers other mitigating factors such as credit history equity and liquid reserves of the borrower as a result the residential mortgage loan portfolio of the bank includes fixed and adjustable rate mortgages with rates that exceed the rates on conventional fixedrate mortgage loan products but are not considered high priced mortgages   consumer loans consist of home equity loans construction loans and loans for the purpose of financing the purchase of consumer goods home improvements and other personal needs and are generally secured by the personal property being purchased  these loans amounted to  million at december    an increase of  million from december     this increase was generated primarily by consumer construction loans a new product the company first offered in   the yield on consumer loans was  percent for   compared to  percent for     there are no concentrations of loans to any borrowers or group of borrowers exceeding  percent of the total loan portfolio and no foreign loans in the portfolio    in the normal course of business the company may originate loan products whose terms could give rise to additional credit risk  interestonly loans loans with high ltv ratios construction loans with payments made from interest reserves and multiple loans supported by the same collateral eg home equity loans are examples of such products  however these products are not material to the company’s financial position and are closely managed via credit controls that mitigate their additional inherent risk  management does not believe that these products create a concentration of credit risk in the company’s loan portfolio the following table shows the maturity distribution or repricing of the loan portfolio and the allocation of fixed and floating interest rates at december          december   in thousands   one year or less   one to five years   over five

total                   for additional information on loans see note  to the consolidated financial statements   troubled debt restructurings   troubled debt restructurings “tdrs” occur when a creditor for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider  these concessions typically include reductions in interest rate extending the maturity of a loan other modifications of payment terms or a combination of modifications  when the company modifies a loan management evaluates the loan for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs  if management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan as applicable through an allowance estimate or chargeoff to the allowance  this process is used regardless of loan type and for loans modified as tdrs that subsequently default on their modified terms at december    there was one loan totaling  thousand that was classified as a tdr by the company and is deemed impaired compared to seven loans totaling  million at december     nonperforming loans included  thousand of tdrs as of december    compared to   thousand at  december     at december    tdrs consisted of one sba held for investment loan which was previously modified back to original terms totaling  thousand restructured loans that are placed in nonaccrual status may be removed after six months of contractual payments and evidence of the ability to service the debt going forward  the remaining tdrs are in accrual status since they are performing in accordance with the restructured terms  there are no commitments to lend additional funds on these loans  the following table presents a breakdown of performing and nonperforming tdrs by class as of december  st for the past two years       december     december   in

lending function is credit risk which is the possibility a borrower may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan  a borrower’s inability to pay their obligations according to the contractual terms can create the risk of past due loans and ultimately credit losses especially on collateral deficient loans  the company minimizes its credit risk by loan diversification and adhering to strict credit administration policies and procedures  due diligence on loans begins when we initiate contact regarding a loan with a borrower  documentation including a borrower’s credit history materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral the purpose of the loan the source of funds for repayment of the loan and other factors are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval  the loan portfolio is then subject to ongoing internal reviews for credit quality as well as independent credit reviews by an outside firm    the risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in collateral values general economic conditions and other factors  in some cases these factors have also resulted in significant impairment to the value of loan collateral  the company values its collateral through the use of appraisals broker price opinions and knowledge of its local market   nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and oreo  nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest nonaccrual loans as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of  days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt  when a loan is classified as nonaccrual interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest previously recognized as income is reversed and charged against current period income  generally until the loan becomes current any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal until such time as management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of a portion of such payments as interest income  loans past due  days or more and still accruing interest are not included in nonperforming loans  loans past due  days or more and still accruing generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process that are expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status the following table sets forth information concerning nonperforming assets and loans past due  days or more and still accruing interest at

nonperforming loans in the commercial sba and sba  segments decreased partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in the consumer loan and residential mortgage segments  included in nonperforming loans at  december   are approximately  thousand  of loans guaranteed by the sba compared to  thousand  at december     in addition there were no loans past due  days or more and still accruing interest at december   or december      oreo properties totaled  million at  december    a decrease of  thousand from  million at year end    during   the company took title to six properties totaling  million that resulted in a charge to the allowance of  thousand and a  thousand writedown which is included in loan costs and oreo expenses  the company sold four oreo properties resulting in a net loss of  thousand on the sales   the company also monitors potential problem loans  potential problem loans are those loans where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan repayment terms these loans are not included in nonperforming loans as they continue to perform  potential problem loans totaled  million at december    a decrease of  million from  million at december    the decrease is due to the removal of three loans totaling  million as well as the payoff of one loan totaling  thousand during the year partially offset by the addition of nine loans totaling  million   for additional information on asset quality see note  to the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments   management reviews the level of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis  the standardized methodology used to assess the adequacy of the allowance includes the allocation of specific and general reserves  specific reserves are made to individual impaired loans which have been defined to include all nonperforming loans and tdrs  the general reserve is set based upon a representative average historical net chargeoff rate adjusted for certain environmental factors such as delinquency and impairment trends chargeoff and recovery trends volume and loan term trends risk and underwriting policy trends staffing and experience changes national and local economic trends industry conditions and credit concentration changes  when calculating the fiveyear historical net chargeoff rate the company weights the past three years more heavily as it believes they are more indicative of future chargeoffs  all of the environmental factors are ranked and assigned a basis points value based on the following scale low low moderate moderate high moderate and high risk  the factors are evaluated separately for each type of loan  for example commercial loans are broken down further into commercial and industrial loans commercial mortgages construction loans etc  each type of loan is risk weighted for each environmental factor based on its individual characteristics    according to the company’s policy a loss “chargeoff” is to be recognized and charged to the allowance for loan losses as soon as a loan is recognized as uncollectable  all credits which are  days past due must be analyzed for the companys ability to collect on the credit  once a loss is known to exist the chargeoff approval process is immediately expedited    the allowance for loan losses totaled  million at december    compared to  million at december    with resulting allowance to total loan ratios of  percent and

subordinated debentures see note  to the consolidated financial statements market risk   based on the company’s business the two largest risks facing the company are market risk and credit risk  market risk for the company is primarily limited to interest rate risk which is the impact that changes in interest rates would have on future earnings  the company’s risk management committee “rmc” manages this risk  the principal objectives of rmc are to establish prudent risk management guidelines evaluate and control the level of interest rate risk in balance sheet accounts determine the level of appropriate risk given the business focus operating environment capital and liquidity requirements and actively manage risk within boardapproved guidelines  the rmc reviews the maturities and repricing of loans investments deposits and borrowings cash flow needs current market conditions and interest rate levels   the company uses various techniques to evaluate risk levels on both a short and longterm basis  one of the monitoring tools is the “gap” ratio  a gap ratio as a percentage of assets is calculated to determine the maturity and repricing mismatch between interest ratesensitive assets and interest ratesensitive liabilities  a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest ratesensitive assets repricing exceeds the amount of interest ratesensitive liabilities repricing in a designated time period  a positive gap should result in higher net interest income with rising interest rates as the amount of the assets repricing exceeds the amount of liabilities repricing  conversely a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest ratesensitive liabilities exceeds interest ratesensitive assets and lower rates should result in higher net interest income   repricing of mortgagerelated securities are shown by contractual amortization and estimated prepayments based on the most recent month constant prepayment rate  callable agency securities are shown based upon their optionadjusted spread modified duration date “oas” rather than the next call date or maturity date  the oas date considers the coupon on the security the time to

december     assumptions regarding the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities are critical in determining the projected level of rate sensitivity  certain savings and interest checking accounts are less sensitive to market interest rate changes than other interestbearing sources of funds  core deposits such as interestbearing demand savings and money market deposits are

cumulative gap                  —     cumulative gap to total assets                       —       at december    there was a sixmonth assetsensitive gap of  million and a oneyear assetsensitive gap of  million as compared to liabilitysensitive gaps of  million and  million at december     the sixmonth and oneyear cumulative gap to total assets ratios were within the boardapproved guidelines of   percent other models are also used in conjunction with the static gap table which is not able to capture the risk of changing spread relationships over time the effects of projected growth in the balance sheet or dynamic decisions such as the modification of investment maturities as a rate environment unfolds  for these reasons a simulation model is used where numerous interest rate scenarios and balance sheets are combined to produce a range of potential income results  net interest income is managed within guideline ranges for interest rates rising or falling by  basis points  results outside of guidelines require action by the rmc to correct the imbalance  simulations are typically created over a  to  month time horizon  at december    these simulations show that with a  basis point rate increase over a  month period net interest income would increase by approximately  million or  percent  a  basis point rate decline over a  month period would decrease net interest income by approximately  million or  percent  these variances in net interest income are within the boardapproved guidelines of   percent   finally to measure the impact of longerterm asset and liability mismatches beyond two years the company utilizes modified duration of equity and economic value of portfolio equity “evpe” models  the modified duration of equity measures the potential price risk of equity to changes in interest rates  a longer modified duration of equity indicates a greater degree of risk to rising interest rates  because of balance sheet optionality an evpe analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows with rate shocks of  basis points  the economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change  results falling outside prescribed ranges require action by the rmc  the company’s variance in the economic value of equity with rate shocks of  basis points is a decline of  percent in a rising rate environment and a decrease of  percent in a falling rate environment at december     at december    the company’s variance in the economic value of equity with rate shocks of  basis points is a decline of  percent in a rising rate environment and a decrease of  percent in a falling rate environment  the variance in the evpe at december   and   were within the boardapproved guidelines in place at the time of   percent liquidity   consolidated bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due  a bank’s liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace  the company’s liquidity is monitored by management and the board of directors through a risk management committee “rmc” which reviews historical funding requirements the current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments  the goal is to maintain sufficient assetbased liquidity to cover potential funding requirements in order to minimize dependence on volatile and potentially unstable funding markets   the principal sources of funds at the bank are deposits scheduled amortization and prepayments of investment and loan principal sales and maturities of investment securities additional borrowings and funds provided by operations  while scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates economic conditions and competition  the consolidated statement of cash flows provides detail on the company’s sources and uses of cash as well as an indication of the company’s ability to maintain an adequate level of liquidity  as the consolidated bank comprises the majority of the assets of the company this consolidated statement of cash flows is indicative of the consolidated bank’s activity  at december    the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  million  an increase of  million from december     a discussion of the cash provided by and used in operating investing and financing activities follows    operating activities provided  million and  million in net cash for the years ended december   and    the primary sources of funds were net income from operations and adjustments to net income such as the proceeds from the sale of mortgage and sba loans held for sale partially offset by originations of mortgage and sba loans held for sale   investing activities used  million and  million in net cash for the years ended december   and   respectively  cash was primarily used to fund new loans purchase securities premises and equipment and fhlb stock partially offset by cash inflows from proceeds from the sales of securities and maturities and pay downs on securities       • securities   the consolidated bank’s available for sale investment portfolio amounted to  million and  million at december   and december    respectively  this excludes the parent company’s securities discussed under the heading “parent company liquidity” below  projected cash flows from securities over the next twelve months are  million • loans   the sba loans held for sale portfolio amounted to  million and  million at december   and december    respectively  sales of these loans provide an additional source of liquidity for the company  • outstanding commitments   the company was committed to advance approximately  million to its borrowers as of december    compared to  million at december     at december     million of these commitments expire within one year compared to  million at december     the company had  million and  million in standby letters of credit at december   and december    respectively which are included in the commitments amount noted above  the estimated fair value of these guarantees is not significant  the company believes it has the necessary liquidity to honor all commitments  many of these commitments will expire and never be funded financing activities provided  million and  million in net cash for the years ended december   and   respectively primarily due to an increase in the company’s borrowings and deposits and the proceeds from the capital offering partially offset by the company’s repayment of borrowings • deposits   as of december    deposits included  million of government deposits as compared to  million at year end   these deposits are generally short in duration and are very sensitive to price competition  the company believes that the current level of these types of deposits is appropriate  included in the portfolio were  million of deposits from twelve municipalities  the withdrawal of these deposits in whole or in part would not create a liquidity shortfall for the company • borrowed funds   total fhlb borrowings amounted to  million and  million as of december   and   respectively  third party repurchase agreements totaled  million as of both december   and december     as a member of the federal home loan bank of new york the company can borrow additional funds based on the market value of collateral pledged  at december    pledging provided an additional  million in borrowing potential from the fhlb  in addition the company can pledge additional collateral in the form of  to  family residential mortgages commercial loans or investment securities to increase this line with the fhlb    parent company liquidity the parent company’s cash needs are funded by dividends paid by the bank  other than its investment in the bank and unity statutory trust ii the parent company does not actively engage in other transactions or business  only expenses specifically for the benefit of the parent company are paid using its cash which typically includes the payment of operating expenses   at december    the parent company had  million in cash and cash equivalents and  thousand in investment securities valued at fair market value compared to  thousand in cash and cash equivalents and  thousand in investment securities at december      offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations   the

maturity dates  for additional information on time deposits see note  to the consolidated financial statements   borrowed funds and subordinated debentures include fixed and adjustable rate borrowings from the federal home loan bank repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures  the borrowings have defined terms and under certain circumstances are callable at the option of the lender for additional information on borrowed funds and subordinated debentures see note  to the consolidated financial statements   operating leases represent obligations entered into by the company for the use of land and premises  the leases generally have escalation terms based upon certain defined indexes for additional information on the company’s operating leases see note  to the consolidated financial statements   purchase obligations represent legally binding and enforceable agreements to purchase goods and services from third parties and consist primarily of contractual obligations under data processing and atm service agreements capital adequacy   a significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its capital base shareholders’ equity increased  million to  million at december   compared to  million at december    primarily due to  million in additional capital as a result of the completion of the capital offering on december   for  shares at a weighted average price of  per share and net income of  million  other items impacting shareholders’ equity included  million in dividends paid on common stock  thousand in unrealized losses net of tax on available for sale securities  million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  thousand in unrealized gains net of tax on cash flow hedges and  thousand in adjustments related to the defined benefit plan the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans includes nonqualified stock options and restricted stock expense related entries employee option exercises and the tax benefit of options exercised   for additional information on shareholders’ equity see note  to the consolidated financial statements   federal regulators have classified and defined capital into the following components  tier  capital which includes tangible shareholders’ equity for common stock qualifying preferred stock and certain qualifying hybrid instruments and  tier  capital which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses certain qualifying longterm debt  preferred stock and hybrid instruments which do not qualify as tier  capital  minimum capital levels are regulated by riskbased capital adequacy guidelines which require the company and the bank to maintain certain capital as a percent of assets and certain offbalance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors riskweighted assets  a bank is required to maintain at a minimum tier  capital as a percentage of riskweighted assets of  percent and combined tier  and tier  capital as a percentage of riskweighted assets of  percent  in addition banks are required to meet a leverage capital requirement which measures tier  capital against average assets  banks which are highly rated and not experiencing significant growth are required to maintain a leverage ratio of  percent while all other banks are expected to maintain a leverage ratio  to  percentage points higher  finally the bank is required to maintain a ratio of common equity tier  capital consisting solely of common equity to riskweighted assets of at least  the company is subject to similar requirements on a consolidated basis   the following table summarizes the company’s and the bank’s regulatory capital ratios at december   and   as well as the minimum regulatory capital ratios required for the bank to be deemed

for additional information on regulatory capital see note  to the consolidated financial statements forwardlooking statements   this report contains certain forwardlooking statements either expressed or implied which are provided to assist the reader in understanding anticipated future financial performance  these statements involve certain risks uncertainties estimates and assumptions by management   factors that may cause actual results to differ from those results expressed or implied include but are not limited to those listed under “item a  risk factors” in the company’s annual report on form k the overall economy and the interest rate environment the ability of customers to repay their obligations the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses competition significant changes in tax accounting or regulatory practices and requirements and technological changes  although management has taken certain steps to mitigate the negative effect of the aforementioned items significant unfavorable changes could severely impact the assumptions used and have an adverse effect on future profitability critical accounting policies and estimates   “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” is based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap”  the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses  note  to the company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december    contains a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies  management believes the company’s policies with respect to the methodology for the determination of the otherthantemporary impairment on securities servicing assets allowance for loan losses and income taxes involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters  changes in these judgments assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations  these critical policies are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors   otherthantemporary impairment   the company has a process in place to identify debt securities that could potentially incur credit impairment that is otherthantemporary this process involves monitoring late payments pricing levels downgrades by rating agencies key financial ratios financial statements revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues  management evaluates securities for otherthantemporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market concern warrants such evaluation  this evaluation considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest raterelated impairment of a security is otherthantemporary  relevant facts and circumstances considered include  the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost  the reasons for the decline in value  the financial position and access to capital of the issuer including the current and future impact of any specific events and  for fixed maturity securities the intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not the security will be required to be sold before the recovery of its amortized cost which in some cases may extend to maturity and for equity securities the ability and intent to hold the security for a forecasted period of time that allows for the recovery in value   management assesses its intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit losses  for debt securities that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired with no intent to sell and no requirement to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis the amount of the impairment is separated into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors  the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows  the remaining difference between the security’s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income  for debt securities where management has the intent to sell the amount of the impairment is reflected in earnings as realized losses   the present value of expected future cash flows is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an assetbacked or floating rate security  the methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security  the assetbacked securities cash flow estimates are based on bond specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics expectations of delinquency and default rates loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support including subordination and guarantees  the corporate bond cash flow estimates are derived from scenariobased outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using bond specific facts and circumstances including timing security interests and loss severity   for additional information on otherthantemporary impairment see note  to the consolidated financial statements   servicing assets   servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights net of servicing costs at the time loans are sold servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenues  impairment is evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term  fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics when available or based upon discounted cash flows using marketbased assumptions  any impairment if temporary would be reported as a valuation allowance   for additional information on servicing assets see note  to the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments   the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses as of the balance sheet date  the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by net chargeoffs   the level of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of probable losses in the loan portfolio after consideration of prevailing economic conditions in the company’s market area the volume and composition of the loan portfolio and historical loan loss experience  the allowance for loan losses consists of specific reserves for individually impaired credits and tdrs and reserves for nonimpaired loans based on historical loss factors and reserves based on general economic factors and other qualitative risk factors such as changes in delinquency trends industry concentrations or localnational economic trends  this risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly and as adjustments become necessary they are realized in the periods in which they become known   although management attempts to maintain the allowance at a level deemed adequate to provide for probable losses future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon certain factors including changes in market conditions and underlying collateral values  in addition various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the company’s allowance for loan losses  these agencies may require the company to make additional provisions based on judgments about information available at the time of the examination   the company maintains an allowance for unfunded loan commitments that is maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses  adjustments to the allowance are made through other expenses and applied to the allowance which is maintained in other liabilities   for additional information on the allowance for loan losses and unfunded loan commitments see note  to the consolidated financial statements   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date if tax reform results in a decline in the corporate tax rates the company would have to writedown its deferred tax asset   valuation reserves are established against certain deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized  increases or decreases in the valuation reserve are charged or credited to the income tax provision   when tax returns are filed it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that ultimately would be sustained  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any  the evaluation of a tax position taken is considered by itself and not offset or aggregated with other positions tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority  the portion of benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits would be recognized in income tax expense on the income statement   for additional information on income taxes see note  to the consolidated financial statements management’s

note  to the consolidated financial statements unity risk management inc is the companys captive insurance company that insures risks to the bank not provided by the traditional commercial insurance market   use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  amounts requiring the use of significant estimates include the allowance for loan losses valuation of deferred tax and servicing assets the carrying value of loans held for sale and other real estate owned the valuation of securities and the determination of otherthantemporary impairment for securities and fair value disclosures  actual results could differ from those estimates    percent stock dividend paid on september   a  percent stock dividend was paid to all shareholders of record as of september   all share information has been adjusted as necessary to account for this dividend cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand amounts due from banks federal funds sold and interestbearing deposits   securities   the company classifies its securities into two categories available for sale and held to maturity   securities that are classified as available for sale are stated at fair value  unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are generally excluded from results of operations and are reported as other comprehensive income a separate component of shareholders’ equity net of taxes  securities classified as available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates changes in prepayment risks or for assetliability management purposes  the cost of securities sold is determined on a specific identification basis  gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized in the consolidated statements of income on the date of sale   securities are classified as held to maturity based on management’s intent and ability to hold them to maturity  such securities are stated at cost adjusted for unamortized purchase premiums and discounts using the level yield method   if transfers between the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios occur they are accounted for at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are accounted for at the date of transfer  for securities transferred to available for sale from held to maturity unrealized gains or losses as of the date of the transfer are recognized in other comprehensive income loss a separate component of shareholders’ equity  for securities transferred into the held to maturity portfolio from the available for sale portfolio unrealized gains or losses as of the date of transfer continue to be reported in other comprehensive income loss and are amortized over the remaining life of the security as an adjustment to its yield consistent with amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount   for additional information on securities see note  to the consolidated financial statements otherthantemporary impairment   the company has a process in place to identify debt securities that could potentially incur credit impairment that is otherthantemporary  this process involves monitoring late payments pricing levels downgrades by rating agencies key financial ratios financial statements revenue forecasts and cash flow projections as indicators of credit issues  management evaluates securities for otherthantemporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market concern warrants such evaluation  this evaluation considers relevant facts and circumstances in evaluating whether a credit or interest raterelated impairment of a security is otherthantemporary  relevant facts and circumstances considered include  the extent and length of time the fair value has been below cost  the reasons for the decline in value  the financial position and access to capital of the issuer including the current and future impact of any specific events and  for fixed maturity securities the intent to sell a security or whether it is more likely than not the company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost which in some cases may extend to maturity   for debt securities that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired where management has no intent to sell and the company has no requirement to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis the amount of the impairment is separated into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors  the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows  the remaining difference between the security’s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income  for debt securities where management has the intent to sell the amount of the impairment is reflected in earnings as realized losses   the present value of expected future cash flows is determined using the best estimate cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete an assetbacked or floating rate security  the methodology and assumptions for establishing the best estimate cash flows vary depending on the type of security  the assetbacked securities cash flow estimates are based on bond specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics expectations of delinquency and default rates loss severity and prepayment speeds and structural support including subordination and guarantees  the corporate bond cash flow estimates are derived from scenariobased outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using bond specific facts and circumstances including timing security interests and loss severity   transfers of financial assets   transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered  control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when  the assets have been isolated from the company  the transferee obtains the right free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and  the company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity   loans   loans held for sale loans held for sale represent the guaranteed portion of sba loans and are reflected at the lower of aggregate cost or market value  the company originates loans to customers under an sba program that historically has provided for sba guarantees of up to   percent of each loan  the company generally sells the guaranteed portion of its sba loans to a third party and retains the servicing holding the nonguaranteed portion in its portfolio  the net amount of loan origination fees on loans sold is included in the carrying value and in the gain or loss on the sale  when sales of sba loans do occur the premium received on the sale and the present value of future cash flows of the servicing assets are recognized in income  all criteria for sale accounting must be met in order for the loan sales to occur see details under the “transfers of financial assets” heading above   servicing assets represent the estimated fair value of retained servicing rights net of servicing costs at the time loans are sold  servicing assets are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenues  impairment is evaluated based on stratifying the underlying financial assets by date of origination and term  fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics when available or based upon discounted cash flows using marketbased assumptions  any impairment if temporary would generally be reported as a valuation allowance   serviced loans sold to others are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  income and fees collected for loan servicing are credited to noninterest income when earned net of amortization on the related servicing assets   for additional information on servicing assets see note  to the consolidated financial statements   loans held for investment loans held for investment are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of unearned discounts and deferred loan origination fees and costs  in accordance with the level yield method loan origination fees net of direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related loans as an adjustment to the loan yield  interest is credited to operations primarily based upon the principal balance outstanding  loans are reported as past due when either interest or principal is unpaid in the following circumstances fixed payment loans when the borrower is in arrears for two or more monthly payments open end credit for two or more billing cycles and single payment notes if interest or principal remains unpaid for  days or more   nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of  days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt nonaccrual loans  when a loan is classified as nonaccrual interest accruals are discontinued and all past due interest previously recognized as income is reversed and charged against current period earnings  generally until the loan becomes current any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal until such time as management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of a portion of such payments as interest income  loans may be returned to an accrual status when the ability to collect is reasonably assured and when the loan is brought current as to principal and interest   loans are charged off when collection is sufficiently questionable and when the company can no longer justify maintaining the loan as an asset on the balance sheet  loans qualify for chargeoff when after thorough analysis all possible sources of repayment are insufficient  these include  potential future cash flows  value of collateral andor  strength of comakers and guarantors  all unsecured loans are charged off upon the establishment of the loan’s nonaccrual status  additionally all loans classified as a loss or that portion of the loan classified as a loss is charged off  all loan chargeoffs are approved by the board of directors   troubled debt restructurings tdrs occur when a creditor for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider  these concessions typically include reductions in interest rate extending the maturity of a loan or a combination of both interest income on accruing tdrs is credited to operations primarily based upon the principal amount outstanding as stated in the paragraphs above    the company evaluates its loans for impairment  a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  the company has defined impaired loans to be all tdrs and nonperforming loans  impairment is evaluated in total for smallerbalance loans of a similar nature consumer and residential mortgage loans and on an individual basis for all other loans  impairment of a loan is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or as a practical expedient based on a loan’s observable market price or the fair value of collateral net of estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateraldependent  if the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan the company establishes a valuation allowance or adjusts existing valuation allowances with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses   for additional information on loans see note  to the consolidated financial statements   allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments   the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management considers adequate to provide for probable loan losses as of the balance sheet date  the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by net chargeoffs     the level of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of probable losses in the loan portfolio after consideration of prevailing economic conditions in the company’s market area the volume and composition of the loan portfolio and historical loan loss experience  the allowance for loan losses consists of specific reserves for individually impaired credits and tdrs reserves for nonimpaired loans based on historical loss factors adjusted for general economic factors and other qualitative risk factors such as changes in delinquency trends industry concentrations or localnational economic trends  this risk assessment process is performed at least quarterly and as adjustments become necessary they are realized in the periods in which they become known      although management attempts to maintain the allowance at a level deemed adequate to provide for probable losses future additions to the allowance may be necessary based upon certain factors including changes in market conditions and underlying collateral values  in addition various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the company’s allowance for loan losses  these agencies may require the company to make additional provisions based on judgments about information available at the time of the examination   the company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb estimated probable losses  adjustments to the reserve are made through other expenses and applied to the reserve which is classified as other liabilities   for additional information on the allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments see note  to the consolidated financial statements premises and equipment   land is carried at cost  all other fixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation  depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  the useful life of buildings is not to exceed  years  furniture and fixtures is generally  years or less and equipment is  to  years   leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the underlying lease    for additional information on premises and equipment see note  to the consolidated financial statements   bank owned life insurance   the company purchased life insurance policies on certain members of management  bank owned life insurance is recorded at its cash surrender value or the amount that can be realized   federal home loan bank stock   federal law requires a member institution of the federal home loan bank system to hold stock of its district fhlb according to a predetermined formula  the stock is carried at cost  management reviews the stock for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis in the stock  the stock’s value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines  management considers such criteria as the significance of the decline in net assets if any of the fhlb the length of time this situation has persisted commitments by the fhlb to make payments required by law or regulation the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of the fhlb and the liquidity position of the fhlb   other real estate owned   other real estate owned is recorded at the fair value less estimated costs to sell at the date of acquisition with a charge to the allowance for loan losses for any excess of the loan carrying value over such amount  subsequently oreo is carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by current appraisals  certain costs that increase the value or extend the useful life in preparing properties for sale are capitalized to the extent that the appraisal amount exceeds the carry value and expenses of holding foreclosed properties are charged to operations as incurred   appraisals   the company requires current real estate appraisals on all loans that become oreo or insubstance foreclosure loans that are classified substandard doubtful or loss or loans that are over   and nonperforming  prior to each balance sheet date the company values impaired collateraldependent loans and oreo based upon a third party appraisal brokers price opinion drive by appraisal automated valuation model updated market evaluation or a combination of these methods  the amount is discounted for the decline in market real estate values for original appraisals for any known damage or repair costs and for selling and closing costs  the amount of the discount is dependent upon the method used to determine the original value  the original appraisal is generally used when a loan is first determined to be impaired  when applying the discount the company takes into consideration when the appraisal was performed the collateral’s location the type of collateral any known damage to the property and the type of business  subsequent to entering impaired status and the company determining that there is a collateral shortfall the company will generally depending on the type of collateral order a third party appraisal brokers price opinion automated valuation model or updated market evaluation  subsequent to receiving the third party results the company will discount the value  to  percent for selling and closing costs   income taxes   the company follows financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  “income taxes” which prescribes a threshold for the financial statement recognition of income taxes and provides criteria for the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  asc  also includes guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition of income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis  deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date  valuation reserves are established against certain deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized  increases or decreases in the valuation reserve are charged or credited to the income tax provision when tax returns are filed it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that ultimately would be sustained  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any  the evaluation of a tax position taken is considered by itself and not offset or aggregated with other positions  tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority  the portion of benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination   interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense on the income statement   for additional information on income taxes see note  to the consolidated financial statements   net income per share   basic net income per common share is calculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the reporting period  diluted net income per common share is computed similarly to that of basic net income per common share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common shares principally stock options were issued during the reporting period utilizing the treasury stock method  however when a net loss rather than net income is recognized diluted earnings per share equals basic earnings per share the amounts reported have been adjusted for the  stock dividend paid on september     for additional information on net income per share see note  to the consolidated financial statements   stockbased compensation   the company accounts for its stockbased compensation awards in accordance with fasb asc topic  “compensation – stock compensation” which requires recognition of compensation expense related to stockbased compensation awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award  compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized over the vesting period of such awards   for additional information on the company’s stockbased compensation see note  to the consolidated financial statements   fair value   the company follows fasb asc topic  “fair value measurement and disclosures” which provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles   for additional information on the fair value of the company’s financial instruments see note  to the consolidated financial statements   other comprehensive income loss   other comprehensive income loss consists of the change in unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale that were reported as a component of shareholders’ equity net of tax   for additional information on other comprehensive income see note  to the consolidated financial statements   advertising   the company expenses the costs of advertising in the period incurred   dividend restrictions   banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels that may limit the dividends paid by the bank to the holding company or by the holding company to the shareholders operating segments   while management monitors the revenue streams of its various products and services operating results and financial performance are evaluated on a companywide basis  the company’s management uses consolidated results to make operating and strategic decisions  accordingly there is only one reportable segment   recent accounting pronouncements   asu  “revenue from contracts with customers topic ”  asu  supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in accounting standards codification topic  revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance throughout the accounting standards codification the guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services   the accounting changes in this update have been revised to defer the effective date for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and the interim periods within that year  the fasb has also issued clarification guidance as it relates to principal versus agent considerations for revenue recognition purposes and clarification guidance on other various considerations related to the new revenue recognition guidance additionally during april  the fasb issued further clarification guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing early adoption is permitted as of the first interim or annual period beginning after december    the company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements   asu no  “financial instruments – overall subtopic  – recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities”  asu  addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments  this eliminates the available for sale classification of accounting for equity securities and adjusts the fair value disclosures for financial instruments carried at amortized cost such that the disclosed fair values represent an exit price as opposed to an entry price  this update requires that equity securities be carried at fair value on the balance sheet and any periodic changes in value will be adjusted through the income statement  a practical expedient is provided for equity securities without a readily determinable fair value such that these securities can be carried at cost less any impairment  for public business entities the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard   asu  “leases topic ” asu  was issued in three parts a section a  “leases amendments to the fasb accounting standards codification®” b section b  “conforming amendments related to leases amendments to the fasb accounting standards codification®” and c section c  “background information and basis for conclusions” while both lessees and lessors are affected by the new guidance the effects on lessees are much more significant  the update states that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases with a term greater than  months the core principle requires the lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a rightofuse asset the accounting applied by the lessor is relatively unchanged as the majority of operating leases should remain classified as operating leases and the income from them recognized generally on a straightline basis over the lease term the standards update also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures for public business entities asc  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   asc  mandates a modified retrospective transition for all entities the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asc  on its consolidated financial

postimplementation review of fasb statement no r sharebased payment areas addressed include the accounting for income taxes classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows the asu is aimed at reducing the cost and complexity of accounting for sharebased payments but will likely result in fluctuations in net income and earnings per share under this guidance all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to employee stock compensation will be recognized within income tax expense via a lower effective tax rate versus previously being

purchased credit impaired loans will receive an allowance account at the acquisition date that represents a component of the purchase price allocation credit losses relating to availableforsale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses with such allowance limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost for public business entities asu  is effective

other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing • contingent consideration payments made after a business combination • proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims • proceeds from the settlement of corporateowned life insurance policies include bankowned life insurance policies • distributions

effort to simplify accounting in a new standard the amendments in this update require that an entity perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount the amendment states that an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit for public business entities asu  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is

assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test  based on a qualitative assessment management determined that the company’s recorded goodwill totaling   million  which resulted from the  acquisition of its phillipsburg new jersey branch is not impaired as of december         restrictions on cash   federal law requires depository institutions to hold reserves in the form of vault cash or if vault cash is insufficient in the form of a deposit maintained with a federal reserve bank “frb”  the dollar amount of a depository institutions reserve requirement is determined by applying the reserve ratios specified in the frb’s regulation d to an institutions reservable liabilities  as of december    the company required  thousand of additional reserves to meet its reserve requirements as of december   the company had sufficient vault cash to meet its reserve requirements and no additional reserves were required   in addition the company’s contract with its current electronic funds transfer “eft” provider requires a predetermined balance be maintained in a settlement account controlled by the

paragraphs that follow   us government sponsored entities and state and political subdivision securities the unrealized losses on investments in these types of securities were caused by the increase in interest rate spreads or the increase in interest rates at the long end of the treasury curve the contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the par value of the investments  because the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis which may be at maturity the company did not consider these investments to be otherthan temporarily impaired as of december     there was no otherthantemporary impairment on these securities at december      residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities   the unrealized losses on investments in mortgagebacked securities were caused by increases in interest rate spreads or the increase in interest rates at the long end of the treasury curve  the majority of contractual cash flows of these securities are guaranteed by the federal national mortgage association fnma the government national mortgage association gnma and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price significantly less than the par value of the investment  because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality and because the company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis which may be at maturity the company did not consider these investments to be otherthantemporarily impaired as of  december   or december      corporate and other securities included in this category are corporate debt securities community reinvestment act “cra” investments assetbacked securities and one trust preferred security  the unrealized losses on corporate debt securities were due to widening credit spreads or the increase in interest rates at the long end of the treasury curve and the unrealized losses on cra investments were caused by decreases in the market prices of the shares  the company evaluated the prospects of the issuers and forecasted a recovery period and as a result determined it did not consider these investments to be otherthantemporarily impaired as of december    or december     the unrealized loss on the trust preferred security was caused by an inactive trading market and changes in market credit spreads  at december   and december    this category consisted of one singleissuer trust preferred security  the contractual terms do not allow the security to be settled at a price less than the par value  because the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis which may be at maturity the company did not consider this security to be

      total loans         loans are made to individuals as well as commercial entities  specific loan terms vary as to interest rate repayment and collateral requirements based on the type of loan requested and the credit worthiness of the prospective borrower  credit risk excluding sba loans tends to be geographically concentrated in that a majority of the loan customers are located in the markets serviced by the bank  as a preferred sba lender a portion of the sba portfolio is to borrowers outside the company’s lending area  however during late  the company withdrew from sba lending outside of its primary trade area but continues to offer sba loan products as an additional credit product within its primary trade area  loan performance may be adversely affected by factors impacting the general economy or conditions specific to the real estate market such as geographic location andor property type  a description of the companys different loan segments follows   sba loans  sba a loans on which the sba has historically provided guarantees of up to   percent of the principal balance are considered a higher risk loan product for the company than its other loan products  the guaranteed portion of the company’s sba loans is generally sold in the secondary market with the nonguaranteed portion held in the portfolio as a loan held for investment  sba loans are for the purpose of providing working capital financing the purchase of equipment inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes  loans are guaranteed by the businesses major owners  sba loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided   sba  loans  the sba  program consists of real estate backed commercial mortgages where the company has the first mortgage and the sba has the second mortgage on the property  sba  loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided  generally the company has a  percent loan to value ratio on sba  program loans at origination   commercial loans   commercial credit is extended primarily to middle market and small business customers  commercial loans are generally made in the company’s market place for the purpose of providing working capital financing the purchase of equipment inventory or commercial real estate and for other business purposes  loans will generally be guaranteed in full or for a meaningful amount by the businesses major owners  commercial loans are made based primarily on the historical and projected cash flow of the business and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided   residential   mortgage and consumer loans  the company originates mortgage and consumer loans including principally residential real estate home equity lines and loans and consumer construction lines  each loan type is evaluated on debt to income type of collateral and loan to collateral value credit history and company relationship with the borrower   inherent in the lending function is credit risk which is the possibility a borrower may not perform in accordance with the contractual terms of their loan  a borrower’s inability to pay their obligations according to the contractual terms can create the risk of past due loans and ultimately credit losses especially on collateral deficient loans  the company minimizes its credit risk by loan diversification and adhering to credit administration policies and procedures  due diligence on loans begins when the company initiates contact regarding a loan with a borrower  documentation including a borrower’s credit history materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral the purpose of the loan the source of funds for repayment of the loan and other factors are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval  the loan portfolio is then subject to ongoing internal reviews for credit quality as well as independent credit reviews by an outside firm   the companys extension of credit is governed by the credit risk policy which was established to control the quality of the companys loans  these policies and procedures are reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a regular basis   credit ratings   for sba a sba  and commercial loans management uses internally assigned risk ratings as the best indicator of credit quality  a loan’s internal risk rating is updated at least annually and more frequently if circumstances warrant a change in risk rating  the company uses a  through  loan grading system that follows regulatory accepted definitions   pass   risk ratings of  through  are used for loans that are performing as they meet and are expected to continue to meet all of the terms and conditions set forth in the original loan documentation and are generally current on principal and interest payments  these performing loans are termed “pass”   special mention   criticized loans are assigned a risk rating of  and termed “special mention” as the borrowers exhibit potential credit weaknesses or downward trends deserving management’s close attention  if not checked or corrected these trends will weaken the bank’s collateral and position  while potentially weak these borrowers are currently marginally acceptable and no loss of interest or principal is anticipated  as a result special mention assets do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification  included in “special mention” could be turnaround situations such as borrowers with deteriorating trends beyond one year borrowers in start up or deteriorating industries or borrowers with a poor market share in an average industry  special mention loans may include an element of asset quality financial flexibility or below average management  management and ownership may have limited depth or experience  regulatory agencies have agreed on a consistent definition of “special mention” as an asset with potential weaknesses which if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the bank’s credit position at some future date  this definition is intended to ensure that the “special mention” category is not used to identify assets that have as their sole weakness credit data exceptions or collateral documentation exceptions that are not material to the repayment of the asset   substandard  classified loans are assigned a risk rating of an  or  depending upon the prospect for collection and deemed “substandard”  a risk rating of  is used for borrowers with welldefined weaknesses that jeopardize the orderly liquidation of debt  the loan is inadequately protected by the current paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged if any  normal repayment from the borrower is in jeopardy although no loss of principal is envisioned  there is a distinct possibility that a partial loss of interest andor principal will occur if the deficiencies are not corrected  loss potential while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard assets does not have to exist in individual assets classified “substandard”     a risk rating of  is used for borrowers that have all the weaknesses inherent in a loan with a risk rating of  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection of debt in full on the basis of currently existing facts conditions and values highly questionable and improbable  serious problems exist to the point where partial loss of principal is likely  the possibility of loss is extremely high but because of certain important reasonably specific pending factors that may work to strengthen the assets the loans’ classification as estimated losses is deferred until a more exact status may be determined  pending factors include proposed merger acquisition or liquidation procedures capital injection perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans  partial chargeoffs are likely   loss  once a borrower is deemed incapable of repayment of unsecured debt the risk rating becomes a  the loan is termed a “loss” and chargedoff immediately  loans to such borrowers are considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as active assets of the bank is not warranted  this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these basically worthless assets even though partial recovery may be affected in the future   for residential mortgage and consumer loans management uses performing versus nonperforming as the best indicator of credit quality  nonperforming loans consist of loans that are not accruing interest nonaccrual loans as a result of principal or interest being delinquent for a period of  days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt  these credit quality indicators are updated on an ongoing basis as a loan is placed on nonaccrual status as soon as management believes there is sufficient doubt as to the ultimate ability to collect interest on a loan   the tables below detail the company’s loan

principal or interest being delinquent for a period of  days or more or when the ability to collect principal and interest according to the contractual terms is in doubt  loans past due  days or more and still accruing interest are not included in nonperforming loans and generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status  the risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in collateral values general economic conditions and other factors  the improved state of the economy has resulted in a substantial reduction in nonperforming loans and loan delinquencies  the company values its collateral through the use of appraisals broker price opinions and knowledge of its local market  in response to the credit risk in its portfolio the company has increased staffing in its credit monitoring department and increased efforts in the collection and analysis of

balances are calculated based on the monthend balances of impaired loans  when the ultimate collectability of the total principal of an impaired loan is in doubt and the loan is on nonaccrual status all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method therefore no interest income is recognized  the interest recognized on impaired loans noted below represents accruing troubled debt

average amount guaranteed by the sba of  thousand and  thousand for years ended december   and   respectively troubled debt restructurings   the companys loan portfolio includes certain loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring “tdr”  tdrs occur when a creditor for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant  these concessions typically include reductions in interest rate extending the maturity of a loan other modifications of payment terms or a combination of modifications  when the company modifies a loan management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is collateraldependent  if management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan impairment is recognized by segment or class of loan as applicable through an allowance estimate or chargeoff to the allowance  this process is used regardless of loan type and for loans modified as tdrs that subsequently default on their modified terms   tdrs of   thousand and   million are included in the impaired loan numbers as of december   and december    respectively at december    there were specific reserves of  thousand on the nonperforming tdr at december    there were specific reserves of  thousand on tdrs  thousand on performing tdrs and  thousand on nonperforming tdrs  at december     thousand of tdrs were in nonaccrual status compared to  thousand at december     the decrease during the twelve month period was primarily due to the payoff of five loans and principal paydowns  as of december   there are no tdrs in accrual status  there are no commitments to lend additional funds on these loans    there were no loans modified as a tdr during the years ended december   or   to date the company’s tdrs consisted of interest rate reductions interest only periods and maturity extensions  there has been no principal forgiveness there were no loans modified as a tdr within the previous  months that subsequently defaulted at some point during the years ended december   or  in this case the subsequent default is defined as  days past due or transferred to nonaccrual status   other loan information   servicing assets loans sold to others and serviced by the company are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  the total amount of such loans serviced but owned by outside investors amounted to approximately  million and  million at december   and   respectively  at december   and   the carrying value which approximates fair value of servicing assets was  million and  million  respectively and is included in other assets  the fair value of sba servicing assets was determined using a discount rate of  percent  constant prepayment speeds ranging from  to   and interest strip multiples ranging from  to   depending on each individual credit  the fair value of mortgage servicing assets was determined using a discount rate of  percent and the present value of excess servicing over  years   a summary of the changes in the related servicing assets for the past two years follows     for the years ended december  in thousands       balance beginning

thousand discount related to the retained portion of the unsold sba loans at december   and   respectively officer and director loans in the ordinary course of business the company may extend credit to officers directors or their associates  these loans are subject to the company’s normal lending policy  an analysis of such loans all of which are current as to principal and interest payments is as follows  in thousands   december     december   balance beginning of year         new loans and advances       loan repayments         balance end of year         loan portfolio collateral the majority of the company’s loans are secured by real estate  declines in the market values of real estate in the company’s trade area impact the value of the collateral securing its loans  this could lead to greater losses in the event of defaults on loans secured by real estate  at both december   and   approximately  percent of the company’s loan portfolio was secured by real estate    allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded loan commitments   allowance for loan losses   the company has an established methodology to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that assesses the risks and losses inherent in the loan portfolio  at a minimum the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by management on a quarterly basis  for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses the company has segmented the loans in its portfolio by loan type  loans are segmented into the following pools sba a sba  commercial residential mortgages and consumer loans  certain portfolio segments are further broken down into classes based on the associated risks within those segments and the type of collateral underlying each loan  commercial loans are divided into the following three classes commercial real estate commercial real estate construction and commercial other  consumer loans are divided into two classes as follows  home equity and other   the standardized methodology used to assess the adequacy of the allowance includes the allocation of specific and general reserves  the same standard methodology is used regardless of loan type  specific reserves are made to individual impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings see note  for additional information on this term  the general reserve is set based upon a representative average historical net chargeoff rate adjusted for the following environmental factors delinquency and impairment trends chargeoff and recovery trends changes in the volume of restructured loans volume and loan term trends changes in risk and underwriting policy trends staffing and experience changes national and local economic trends industry conditions and credit concentration changes  within the fiveyear historical net chargeoff rate the company weights the past three years more because it believes they are more indicative of future losses  all of the environmental factors are ranked and assigned a basis points value based on the following scale low low moderate moderate high moderate and high risk  each environmental factor is evaluated separately for each class of loans and risk weighted based on its individual characteristics    • for sba a sba  and commercial loans the estimate of loss based on pools of loans with similar characteristics is made through the use of a standardized loan grading system that is applied on an individual loan level and updated on a continuous basis  the loan grading system incorporates reviews of the financial performance of the borrower including cash flow debtservice coverage ratio earnings power debt level and equity position in conjunction with an assessment of the borrowers industry and future prospects  it also incorporates analysis of the type of collateral and the relative loan to value ratio • for residential mortgage and consumer loans the estimate of loss is based on pools of loans with similar characteristics  factors such as credit score delinquency status and type of collateral are evaluated  factors are updated frequently to capture the recent behavioral characteristics of the subject portfolios as well as any changes in loss mitigation or credit origination strategies and adjustments to the reserve factors are made as needed    according to the company’s policy a loss “chargeoff” is to be recognized and charged to the allowance for loan losses as soon as a loan is recognized as uncollectable  all credits which are  days past due must be analyzed for the company’s ability to collect on the credit  once a loss is known to exist the chargeoff approval process is immediately expedited  this chargeoff policy is followed for all loan types   the allocated allowance is the total of identified specific and general reserves by loan category  the allocation is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur  the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio  an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses the following tables detail

proceeds stated above were used to purchase the subordinated debentures under the same terms and conditions at december    thousand of the common equity securities remained   the capital securities in each of the above transactions have preference over the common securities with respect to liquidation and other distributions and qualify as tier i capital  under the terms of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act these securities will continue to qualify as tier  capital as the company has less than  billion in assets  in accordance with fasb asc topic  “consolidation” the company does not consolidate the accounts and related activity of unity nj statutory trust ii and unity nj statutory trust iii because it is not the primary beneficiary  the additional capital from each of these transactions was used to bolster the company’s capital ratios and for general corporate purposes including among other things capital contributions to the bank   the company has the ability to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures for up to  years without being in default  due to the redemption provisions of these securities the expected maturity could differ

the company for its own account until maturity on august     the interest rate on the capital note is  per annum on the unpaid principal amount until the principal amount of the capital note has been satisfied in full the capital note was paid in full in july    derivative financial instruments and hedging activities   derivative financial instruments the company has a stand alone derivative financial instrument in the form of an interest rate swap agreement which derives its value from underlying interest rates  this transaction involves both credit and market risk  the notional amounts are amounts on which calculations payments and the value of the derivative is based  notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures  direct credit exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid if any  such difference which represents the fair value of the derivative instrument is reflected on the company’s balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities   the company is exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to this agreement  the company controls the credit risk of its financial contracts through credit approvals limits and monitoring procedures and does not expect any counterparties to fail their obligations  the company deals only with primary dealers   derivative instruments are generally either negotiated otc contracts or standardized contracts executed on a recognized exchange  negotiated otc derivative contracts are generally entered into between two counterparties that negotiate specific agreement terms including the underlying instrument amount exercise prices and maturity   risk management policies – hedging instruments the primary focus of the company’s assetliability management program is to monitor the sensitivity of the company’s net portfolio value and net income under varying interest rate scenarios to take steps to control its risks  on a quarterly basis the company evaluates the effectiveness of entering into any derivative agreement by measuring the cost of such an agreement in relation to the reduction in net portfolio value and net income volatility within an assumed range of interest rates   interest rate risk management – cash flow hedging instruments the company has fhlb adjustable rate credit “arc” variable rate debt as a source of funds for use in the company’s lending and investment activities and for other general business purposes  these debt obligations expose the company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates  if interest rates increase interest expense increases  conversely if interest rates decrease interest expense decreases  management believes it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments and therefore hedges its variablerate interest payments  to meet this objective management enters into interest rate swap agreements whereby the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments during the contract period   during the twelve months ended december   and   the company received variable rate libor payments from and paid fixed rates in accordance with its interest rate swap agreements  a summary of the company’s outstanding interest rate swap agreements used to hedge variable rate

business become a party to litigation involving collection matters contract claims and other legal proceedings relating to the conduct of its business  in the best judgment of management based upon consultation with counsel the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the company will not be affected materially by the final outcome of any pending legal proceedings or other contingent liabilities and commitments   commitments to borrowers   commitments to extend credit are legally binding loan commitments with set expiration dates  they are intended to be disbursed subject to certain conditions upon the request of the borrower  the company was committed to advance approximately  million to its borrowers as of december    compared to  million at december     at december     million of these commitments expire within one year compared to  million a year earlier  at december    the company had  million in standby letters of credit compared to  million at

of the allowance for loan losses subject to limitations certain qualifying longterm debt preferred stock and hybrid instruments which do not qualify for tier  capital the parent company and its

percentage of tangible assets tier  riskbased capital ratio tier  capital as a percent of riskweighted assets total riskbased capital ratio total riskbased capital as a percent of total riskweighted assets and common equity tier  capital ratio   minimum capital levels are regulated by riskbased capital adequacy guidelines which require the company and the bank to maintain certain capital as a percentage of assets and certain offbalance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors riskweighted assets failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and

in  and   respectively     fair value   fair value measurement   the company follows fasb asc topic  “fair value measurement and disclosures”  which requires additional disclosures about the company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value  fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date  in determining fair value the company uses various methods including market income and cost approaches  based on these approaches the company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk andor the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique  these inputs can be readily observable market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs  the company utilizes techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  the fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values  financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed as follows   level  inputs • unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical unrestricted assets or liabilities • generally this includes debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market ie new york stock exchange as well as certain us treasury us government and sponsored entity agency mortgagebacked securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in overthecounter markets   level  inputs • quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  • quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets • inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the term of the asset or liability ie interest rates yield curves credit risks prepayment speeds or volatilities or “market corroborated inputs” • generally this includes us government and sponsored entity mortgagebacked securities corporate debt securities and derivative contracts level  inputs • prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable ie supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities • these assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation   fair value on a recurring basis   the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis   securities available for sale as of december    the fair value of the companys afs securities portfolio was  million   approximately  percent of the portfolio was made up of residential mortgagebacked securities which had a fair value of  million at december     approximately  million of the residential mortgagebacked securities are guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  the underlying loans for these securities are residential mortgages that are geographically dispersed throughout the united states    all of the company’s afs securities were classified as level  assets at december     the valuation of afs securities using level  inputs was primarily determined using the market approach which uses quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and all other relevant information  it includes model pricing defined as valuing securities based upon their relationship with other benchmark securities    there were no changes in the inputs or methodologies used to determine fair value during the year ended december    as compared to the year ended december        the tables below present the balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  st for the past two years

measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances for example when there is evidence of impairment  the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   appraisal policy all appraisals must be performed in accordance with the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice “uspap”  appraisals are certified to the company and performed by appraisers on the company’s approved list of appraisers  evaluations are completed by a person independent of company management  the content of the appraisal depends on the complexity of the property  appraisals are completed on a “retail value” and an “as is value” the company requires current real estate appraisals on all loans that become oreo or insubstance foreclosure loans that are classified substandard doubtful or loss or loans that are over  and nonperforming  prior to each balance sheet date the company values impaired collateraldependent loans and oreo based upon a third party appraisal brokers price opinion drive by appraisal automated valuation model updated market evaluation or a combination of these methods  the amount is discounted for the decline in market real estate values for original appraisals for any known damage or repair costs and for selling and closing costs  the amount of the discount ranges from  to  percent and is dependent upon the method used to determine the original value  the original appraisal is generally used when a loan is first determined to be impaired  when applying the discount the company takes into consideration when the appraisal was performed the collateral’s location the type of collateral any known damage to the property and the type of business  subsequent to entering impaired status and the company determining that there is a collateral shortfall the company will generally depending on the type of collateral order a third party appraisal brokers price opinion automated valuation model or updated market evaluation  subsequent to receiving the third party results the company will discount the value  to  percent for selling and closing costs   oreo the fair value was determined using appraisals which may be discounted based on management’s review and changes in market conditions level  inputs       impaired collateraldependent loans the fair value of impaired collateraldependent loans is derived in accordance with fasb asc topic  “receivables”  fair value is determined based on the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  partially chargedoff loans are measured for impairment based upon an appraisal for collateraldependent loans  when an updated appraisal is received for a nonperforming loan the value on the appraisal is discounted in the manner discussed above  if there is a deficiency in the value after the company applies these discounts management applies a specific reserve and the loan remains in nonaccrual status  the receipt of an updated appraisal would not qualify as a reason to put a loan back into accruing status  the company removes loans from nonaccrual status when the borrower makes six months of contractual payments and demonstrates the ability to service the debt going forward  chargeoffs are determined based upon the loss that management believes the company will incur after evaluating collateral for impairment based upon the valuation methods described above and the ability of the borrower to pay any deficiency   the valuation allowance for impaired loans is included in the allowance for loan losses in the consolidated balance sheets  at december    the valuation allowance for impaired loans was  thousand  a decrease of  thousand from  thousand at december       the following tables present the assets and liabilities subject to fair value adjustments impairment on a nonrecurring basis carried on the

certain financial instruments including those financial instruments for which the company did not elect the fair value option  these estimated fair values as of december   and december   have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies  considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop estimates of fair value  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange  the use of alternative market assumptions and estimation methodologies could have had a material effect on these estimates of fair value  the methodology for estimating the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis are discussed above   the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value   cash and cash equivalents for these shortterm instruments the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value   securities the fair value of securities is based upon quoted market prices for similar or identical assets or other observable inputs level  or externally developed models that use unobservable inputs due to limited or no market activity of the instrument level    sba loans held for sale the fair value of sba loans held for sale is estimated by using a market approach that includes significant other observable inputs   loans the fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates that reflect the interest rate risk inherent in the loan except for previously discussed impaired loans   federal home loan bank stock federal home loan bank stock is carried at cost  carrying value approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions of the issues   servicing assets servicing assets do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices  the company estimates the fair value of servicing assets using discounted cash flow models incorporating numerous assumptions from the perspective of a market participant including market discount rates and prepayment speeds   accrued interest the carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value   deposit liabilities the fair value of demand deposits and savings accounts is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date ie carrying value  the fair value of fixedmaturity certificates of deposit is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current market rates   borrowed funds and subordinated debentures the fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting the projected future cash flows using current market rates   standby letters of credit at december    the bank had standby letters of credit outstanding of  million  as compared to  million at december     the fair value of these commitments is nominal the table below presents the carrying amount
