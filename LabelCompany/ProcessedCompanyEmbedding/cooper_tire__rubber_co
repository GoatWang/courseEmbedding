michael boyd longshort equity contrarian mediumterm horizon midcapmarketplaceindustrial insightssummarycooper tire is small but it is a retail investor favorite cheap valuation strong management easy to understand business modelhowever the company has been dirt cheap for a while now and the recent selloff shows that it can be punished just as much as highflying momentum namesthere are problems here mainly with cash management and heavy capital spending research and development expenditures seem low compared to peersq  was a lesson on just how fragile the company can be if competitors get aggressive stay watchfuli think cooper tire  rubber nysectb has likely been a longterm holding of many value investors and one that has brought a lot of frustration to many it checks a lot of boxes that investors look for the company has a long and storied history with a great management team a strong market position is perpetually cheap x evebitda and generates quality underlying gaap earnings with little to no funny business via nongaap adjustments overall global tire demand remains strong and the companys strategic transformation is on track according to the big guys in the executive suite so what are the underlying issues here and why does this company seem to have such a hard time seeing some trading multiple expansion ill be a little harsh here but im going to try and touch on the negative facets of the cooper tire story strategic transformation like most tire manufacturers cooper tire is trying to shift up the value chain into higher margin products the first step there means moving away from tires sold to original equipment oe manufacturers and towards replacement tires historically having your tire on an oe vehicle was a solid recipe for generating replacement revenue down the line many consumers simply replace the tires on their vehicle with the same brand and model when a change is due however in return for that privilege as well as to reap benefits from buying large volumes oes demanded rock bottom pricing margins were and are very thin as a result in this side of the business sadly management does not break out sales mix between oe and replacement in any of its presentations or sec filings however you can find signs of this reality within the companys current operations  just take a look at the international tire segment cooper tire has seen much stronger growth internationally  yy in q  or m increase in revenue but still posted a m contraction in gross profit within the segment after that growth this is because the company is partnering with oe asian manufacturers to help build a presence increased sales are a wash unfortunately that situation is a burden that must be shouldered by smaller market participants even domestically i dont believe cooper tire has the size to be ignoring the oe market as much as it is while it is the fifth largest us manufacturer the brands within its portfolio have very little name recognition with consumers in my opinion this translates to the replacement market where that brand recognition matters and if that piece of the puzzle is missing it is forced to compete heavily on price or face consequences see q results discussion below as an example likewise cooper tires continued shift into premiumbranded products performance tires larger rim diameters largely built upon new product launches also to some extent relies on that brand recognition story eventually consumer funds will flow to the most compelling product lines based on performance and results and perception of value will follow however to me the company seems to be going about this the wrong way cooper tire continues to invest heavily in technical capability via the expansion of its asian technical center as well as significantly expanding its production facilities capex guidance for  of m at the midpoint is a significant expansion from prior year levels these efforts however seem more directed at improving efficiency and yields rather than developing inventive or new products that would really catapult the company forward granularly the research and development budget has remained relatively flat over the past several years m annual average at cooper tire that is less than  of sales and it means much larger competitors like goodyear tire nysegt and bridgestone otcpkbrdcy which see annual sales of  times that of cooper tire are significantly outspending the company on product research as a percentage of revenue  and  of sales respectively i dont see how the company can expect to win premium market share when it is getting outspent on both a nominal and percentage basis q s trainwreck the market did not take kindly to cooper tires q results sending the shares down double digits at times weakness continued post earnings release and unfortunately cooper tire has seen more than  of its value cut at the same time as the market has been marginally up during the quarter american tire sales fell  to m due to a  decline in volume gross margin fell  bps to  helping drive a butchering of operating margins that were nearly cut in half the company was pretty firm on pricing in the quarter despite the fact that competitors were doing aggressive promotions during a period of rising raw material costs light vehicle tire sales volume was down  at cooper tire in the quarter despite the fact that the rubber manufacturers association rma reported an increase of  in sales in that segment yy overall when volumes fall like this it impacts the entire company as operating leverage contracts and the fact that cooper tire reports on a last in first out basis lifo the impact of higher raw materials only made things worse this all goes back to the strategic transformation q should make it clear that cooper tire is still a price taker not a price setter tires are a tough market where most consumers dont have the expertise to spot differentiation and if the competition wants to compete on price cooper tire simply does not have the clout to sit on its hands and not react while management does expect some improvement heading into q and has noticed its competition lowering promotional activity i was still surprised to see the company reaffirm its operating margin guidance of  and i think the quarter shows how aspirational managements target of consistently reporting above  operating margin really is given q expectations were tempered by management id advise being very careful here lest investors get strung along for another dive come q reporting if there was any bright spot to be taken from q it was international segment results while the company saw negative impact yy when it came to pricing operations did see significant benefits from manufacturing efficiencies and volume international operations remain far away from moving the needle in any meaningful way  m in q  operating profit versus m for the americas business  but there are signs that cooper tire is starting to win market share in the everimportant chinese market the recent favorable ruling on truck and bus radial tbr which reversed preliminary tariffs that cooper tire had been paying on imported tires from its chinese manufacturing facilities to america was also a favorable development cash management and its impact on valuation cooper tire has had a rough time with working capital over the past several years culminating in a m negative build over  q  isnt off to a great start on solving that with m in negative impact largely inventory driven as expected given weak q volumes unfortunately any improvement this year that could drive free cash flow improvement is likely to be offset by the large capex budget that i mentioned earlier given the m net cash position at cooper tire on the balance sheet leverage is not an issue if the free cash flow was there im sure management would be buying back stock hand over fist to me that thin cash availability for shareholder returns is the primary hurdle that keeps cooper tire from trading up towards evebitda multiples of peers x or  discount or the broader auto parts supply subsector most in the x ebitda range i dont mind the business and the valuation is alluring but when a company has traded cheaply for years there are underlying reasons why and investors should not expect that to change without some sort of catalyst i dont think the challenges are insurmountable and there are positives to latch onto like the balance sheet or growing relevancy of the companys overseas operations the market will in the meantime continue to take a show me attitude particularly into the rest of this year given guidance and it will be interesting to watch and observe just how well that plays out disclosure iwe have no

executive officer brad hughes and ginger jones our chief financial officer during our conversation today you may hear forwardlooking statements related to future financial results and business operations of cooper tire  rubber company actual results may differ materially from current management forecasts and projections such differences may be a result of factors over which the company has limited or no control information on these risk factors and additional information on forwardlooking statements are included in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning and in the companys reports on file with the sec during this call we will provide an overview of the companys first quarter  financial and operating results as well as our business outlook our earnings release includes a link to a set of slides that summarize information included in the news release and in the q that will be filed with the sec later today following our prepared remarks we will open the call to participants for a questionandanswer session now ill turn the call over to brad bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co thanks jerry and good morning everyone this morning i will begin with a brief overview of our first quarter  financial results and then provide an update on coopers progress towards our strategic priorities finally i will highlight some of our operational achievements during the quarter after that i will turn the call over to ginger for a more detailed discussion of our first quarter performance the current business environment and capital allocation ill return to present our business outlook for the remainder of the year and then well take your questions with that lets get started results in the first quarter were driven by raw material costs and related pricing activity as you know cooper is on lifo in the us and rising raw material costs affect our profits sooner our pricing actions in the us in response to these raw material increases occurred later in the quarter and this drove lower margins for our business in addition the timing of price increases and aggressive promotions by competitors as well as weaker sellout volumes for the whole industry had an impact on our volumes in the us this was partially offset by strong sales in our other regions looking forward some of these industry dynamics will continue into the second quarter we believe cooper is well positioned as we head into the remainder of  as raw materials are beginning to stabilize price increases are taking hold and while it is early we are seeing improving unit order trends in the us market in the second quarter as a result we expect us volumes to improve relative to the industry in the second quarter we also expect margins to improve and we are reaffirming our full year  operating margin guidance at the highend of our  to  range consolidated operating profit margin range now lets get into the details net sales for the period were  million down about  compared with the same period last year operating profit was  million down  million driven by two important factors higher raw material costs of  million with an offset of  million from our march price increases and mix improvements light vehicle volume in the us was down  which reduced profits and had a related effect on manufacturing costs which were up due to the unabsorbed costs from managing inventory levels by lowering output on the positive side us tbr unit volume was up  latin america unit volume was up nearly  and international segment unit volume was up  combined global unit volume increased by nearly  yearoveryear ginger will provide more details on the profit changes the us light vehicle volume decline i just mentioned compared with the rubber manufacturers associations reported increase of  and a total industry increase of  our performance relative to these metrics was primarily due to the timing of competitor price increases promotional activity as well as overall weaker sellout volumes for the industry the industry has been implementing price increases however the nature and timing of these increases have been varied and there have been more promotional activities than we expected affecting buyer behavior in the market in the us cooper implemented price increases on march  we went with a straightforward price increase while competitors used a variety of approaches including delayed timing price protection programs and promotions this variation in approach created a negative shortterm volume impact in the first quarter for cooper as it motivated some customers to buy from the competition ahead of expected price increases we also saw increased sales channel inventories across the industry although we believe inventories for cooper are in reasonable shape at  million cooper ended the first quarter with an operating profit margin of  of net sales near the lowend of our  to  guidance the quarter also included multiple unusual items totaling a net benefit of  million these unusual items include the reversal of preliminary tbr tariffs incurred in  which totaled  million the  million benefit of the tariff reversal was partially offset by  million of certain direct expenses associated with the damages from a tornado at the leased distribution center in albany georgia and  million to write off certain assets related to the companys global erp system implementation in addition to the direct costs noted above the tornado damage also affected our distribution to certain customers and markets in the us although hard to quantify this also had a negative impact on our first quarter results each of these factors will be discussed in more detail later in the call diluted earnings per share were  down from  a year ago cooper continued to return cash to shareholders through our capital allocation plan which ginger will discuss in more detail we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as evidenced by the  million share repurchase program recently authorized by our board but we will be opportunistic as we implement the purchases im pleased to report that we continue to earn strong returns on our investment delivering a  return on invested capital for the trailing four quarters cooper will continue to execute our strategic plan priorities of driving top line profitable growth developing a highly competitive cost structure and building even stronger organizational capabilities significant changes to our business model including positive mix transformation improved speed to market with exciting new products and cost efficiencies have allowed us to structurally improve operating margins over time these business model improvements will help cooper to respond and succeed over the longer term including during periods of rising raw material costs and product pricing fluctuation we continue to focus on our house brands and on satisfying demand for tires with larger rim diameters and other high margin features new product introductions and innovation continue to play a significant role in driving growth for cooper we continue to shorten our product development cycle time in fact we have reduced it by over  since  this capability to respond quickly to customer requirements is a key enabler for our success in asia where we have achieved over  domestic volume growth versus the prior year in latin america tailored product offerings along with expanded distribution helped us to achieve broader market penetration and a corresponding yearoveryear domestic unit volume increase of  in the us we are growing our tbr business and again significantly outperform the industry with a strong product offering including new tires like the smartway verified rma  which provides longlasting mileage and improved traction in challenging weather our engineers designed this tire with a compound that offers not only lower rolling resistance for fuel economy but also a deep tread that can stand up to the demands of the road it showcases the performance for which our roadmaster tires are known and illustrates how committed we are to continuing to develop tires that meet the needs of our customers we are leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and nearsource supply strategy while maintaining a focus on reducing costs to secure our value proposition and enhanced profit margins in the us we are adding more automation at our facilities to strengthen our longterm competitiveness in europe we are investing in new tire building equipment at our serbia plant to expand capacity and build larger diameter tires leveraging this costeffective facility for future growth not only in europe but also in the middle east and other markets around the world in asia we continue to upgrade plant capabilities and install equipment to support growth and meet the rigorous requirements of our oe customers now shifting gears to external factors as we said during our last call there are significant headwinds and challenges facing the industry and the company in  these include volatile raw material costs competitive promotions and product pricing activity uncertainty over tax and trade policies and the changing global political environment our raw material index was sequentially up during the first quarter from  in the fourth quarter to  in the first quarter as shown on page  of the supplemental slide deck this was over  higher than the  index for the first quarter of  the raw material index trend during the first quarter was up sequentially in january february and march as we look forward we anticipate that raw material costs will be up modestly in the second quarter and will stabilize in the second half of the year after the broad round of industry price increases announced in the first quarter weve now seen a large competitor announce a new price increase in the us so we expect the product pricing and program activity will continue during the second quarter coopers march price increase is fully implemented and we will continue to be marketfacing including promotional programs as appropriate again we expect our us unit volume to improve relative to the industry during the second quarter and anticipate that our price increases will deliver more benefit with a full quarters impact for the second half of the year we expect our us unit volume to be in line with the industry we remain committed to our longterm approach to recover input cost increases in line with the industry overall we believe that global production capacity remains balanced and as the industry continues to shift towards larger rim diameter and more complex tires capacity for these hva tires remains below current demand which supports a rational pricing environment going forward turning to tariffs on february  the united states international trade commission determined that there was no material injury to the us tire industry from tbr tires produced in china and imported into the united states this means there will be no antidumping or countervailing duties on tbr tires from china and that all of the preliminary tariffs collected during this process are being refunded because all of our tbr tires are presently sourced from china this ruling is positive for cooper as noted in our release this resulted in a benefit of  million in the first quarter of  for the reversal of the tariff costs incurred in  now we would like to talk about some of the operational achievements we had in the first quarter first i want to congratulate the team at our tupelo mississippi facility the rubber manufacturers association has again recognized tupelo with its prestigious safety and health improvement program award this is the fourth time in the past five years that tupelo has received this award the safety and health of our employees is our top priority in europe we had domestic unit volume growth of nearly  reflecting strength in the uk market and the success of new products for example our new cooper zeon xs sport suv tire placed in the top  of  tires from leading brands and earned a highly recommended rating in the most recent annual test of summer tires by the very influential adac the adac is a respected testing body in germany relied upon by many european consumers for guidance on vehicle and tire quality and safety in summary im confident in our business model our team and in our ability to rise to the challenges presented now i would like to turn the call over to ginger for an update on the financial results and capital allocation ginger m jones  cooper tire  rubber co thank you brad ill start with our first quarter highlights net sales were  million compared with  million in the first quarter of  a decrease of  while overall unit volume increased there was an overall negative impact to sales during the quarter as cooper sold fewer units in north america a region with a typically higher average price per tire this resulted in a net reduction to sales of  million we also experienced  million of negative foreign currency impact these reductions were partially offset by  million of favorable price and mix primarily attributable to net price increases related to the higher raw material costs operating profit was  million or  of sales compared with  million or  of sales in  first quarter operating profit as compared with the same period in  was impacted by the following factors which are summarized on page  of the supplemental slide deck  million of unfavorable raw material costs as a reminder ongoing tariff costs are included in raw material costs in the quarter when incurred we also had  million of favorable price and mix combined these factors totaled to  million of unfavorable raw material costs net of price and mix as the implementation of product pricing lag raw material cost increases as brad mentioned earlier in the us we use the lifo accounting method so our results reflect the impact of changing material costs more quickly than most competitors we had  million of higher manufacturing costs due to lower production volumes in north america  million of lower unit volume driven by the unit volume decline in north america  million of higher other costs which include  million of direct costs related to the tornado damages  million of negative foreign currency impact and  million of unfavorable sga costs which include  million related to the writeoff of certain assets for the companys global erp system implementation as you know we implemented erp in the us and are planning a global implementation as part of this rollout effort and as we evaluate which systems to use in each region we have assessed our global plan and written off certain assets related to the project these negative factors were partially offset by  million of benefit for the reversal of tariffs incurred in  we delivered earnings per share of  compared with  in the first quarter of  a contribution of  per share came from the lower share count resulting from our share repurchase program moving to our segment performance ill start with the americas tire operations segment sales for the first quarter were  million down  from  million in  this decrease was the result of  million of lower unit volume  million of negative foreign currency impact and  million of unfavorable price and mix first quarter operating profit in the americas was  million or  of net sales compared with  million or  of net sales in the same period last year operating profit was impacted by  million of unfavorable raw material costs net of price and mix  million of higher manufacturing costs with cost savings during the quarter which were more than offset by costs from actions taken to manage inventory levels  million of lower unit volume  million of other expense which includes  million in direct costs related to the tornado damage and  million of negative foreign currency these were partially offset by the  million of tariff reversal benefit and  million of favorable sga costs the previously referenced  million in expenses related to the tornado damage in the first quarter includes direct costs incurred in the quarter to destroy damaged tires freight to move products to other warehouses and professional fees to secure and maintain the site we expect that these costs less the deductible will be recovered from our insurance carriers at some point in the future the estimates of full year  direct costs for tornado damages is expected to be between  million and  million these costs do not include indirect costs or the impact of business disruption which affected our results in the first quarter and will continue to do so in the future we will seek to recover such costs from insurance carriers you can see the full profit walk for the americas on slide  of our supplemental slide deck now turning to our international tire operations as a reminder all results for the international segment include the consolidated results of our new joint venture grt net sales for the first quarter were  million up  from the first quarter of  unit volume in the segment was  higher in the first quarter of  compared to the prior year as a result of increases in both asia and europe sales increased by  million as a result of  million of higher unit volume and  million of favorable price and mix which was partially offset by  million of negative foreign currency impact the international segment improved its operating results compared with last year with an operating profit of  million in the first quarter compared to an operating loss of  million in the same period a year ago these results were driven by  million of higher unit volume  million of favorable manufacturing costs and  million of favorable other costs which were partially offset by  million of unfavorable raw material costs net of price and mix  million of unfavorable sga expense and  million of negative foreign currency impact you can see the full profit walk for the international operations segment on slide  of our supplemental slide deck this was a great quarter for the international segment which is driving unit volume growth and improvement in operating margins now turning to some corporate items the effective tax rate was  for the first quarter compared with  for the same period last year the decrease in the rate is primarily due to the implementation of accounting standards update  under which excess tax benefits from sharebased payments must be recognized discretely in the period in which they occur the effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual earnings and tax rates for the various tax jurisdiction in which the company operates we estimate the full year  effective tax rate to be in a range of  to  more details on our taxes is available in the form q that will be filed with the sec later today cash and cash equivalents were  million at march   compared with  million at march   capital expenditures in the first quarter were  million we anticipate our fullyear capital expenditures for  to be between  million and  million we believe this is the appropriate level of capital to support our ongoing modernization mix transformation and automation initiatives in addition to investments in capacity to align with our global strategic growth plans moving to capital returns in february  our board extended and increased our share repurchase program by authorizing the repurchase of up to  million of the companys outstanding common stock through december   during the first quarter approximately  shares were repurchased for  million at an average price of  per share since share repurchase began in august  the company has repurchased a total of  million shares at an average price of  per share i want to remind you that cooper believes that our existing cash cash flows and potential leverage are more than sufficient to support our capital allocation priorities we define those priorities as supporting our ongoing commitments capital to support organic growth and margin improvement initiative acquisitions and partnerships and funding our dividend and share repurchase goals we believe our operating performance our sustained high level of roic and our demonstrated commitment to delivering on our strategic plan including a balanced approach to capital allocation delivers longterm value to shareholders ill now turn the call back to brad for perspective on the balance of the year bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co thanks ginger in summary the first quarter was one of transition as we absorbed higher raw material costs and implemented product price increases our strategy to diversify and grow our nonus businesses is paying off as we saw very strong unit volume growth in our faster growing markets of asia and latin america and a continued turnaround with doubledigit unit volume growth in europe the growth in these businesses more than offset the shortterm unit volume disruption we experienced in the us that said we recognize that north america is the largest segment of our business and we are laserfocused on responding to market factors and improving our results there looking ahead while raw material costs seem to be stabilizing we expect that additional price and promotional activity will affect us volumes in the second quarter for the full year  we expect continued strong unit volume growth in our international segment and in latin america we continue to closely monitor the raw material and related pricing environment and currently project that pricing dynamics will normalize in the coming quarters our unit volume in the us is expected to improve relative to the industry for the second quarter and be in line with the industry in the second half of the year we still believe that first half operating profit margin will be around the lowend of our  to  range with raw material costs projected to level off in the coming quarters and product pricing actions in place we anticipate that full year  operating profit margin will be at the highend of our previously announced midterm target of  to  with operating profit margin exceeding  in the second half of the year we remain confident in the strength of the cooper business model and we believe significant levers remain to further improve our business based on continued execution of our strategic plan these levers are cost reductions in the way we design and manufacture our products including automation and process improvement and in how we procure our materials mix enhancement with a continued shift to larger more premium hva tires driven by trends in oe vehicles growth and scale particularly in asia and latin america optimization of our global manufacturing footprint and continuing to expand margins in the international segment with these opportunities and others we are confident that as price increases are implemented and raw material costs stabilize further improvements in operating profit will be achieved with that lets move to your questions operator will you take the first question please questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and our first question comes from christopher van horn with fbr please go ahead christopher van horn  fbr capital markets  co good morning guys and thanks for taking my call bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co hi chris christopher van horn  fbr capital markets  co hi so the back half of – the guidance for the back half implies pretty strong margins and i just wanted to kind of jump into pricing here is that kind of the main driver in order to get us there or are there other levers you can pull if pricing doesnt really pan out and then just kind of your commentary maybe so far this month what youre seeing from a pricing perspective are we starting to see those prices go through and just kind of your confidence level there bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co let me go at it in reverse order ill start and then sequentially move into the second half but as we look at how we are transitioning out of the first quarter and into the second quarter the industry has been implementing price increases theyve come in all kinds of different forms as we alluded to during the commentary a moment ago there was price protection for a period of time to allow people to bring orders in there were later announcements some of the larger players have had price increases that arent effective until april  or even may  so all of that continues to come into play we are seeing a relative level of promotional activity that may be a little bit higher than it would be at this time of year in other years but overall it looks like the pricing is coming into the market its just a matter of getting it all in and in place and everybody resettling into their appropriate positions on a competitive basis and we think that will happen largely in the second quarter as that is completing itself that process we do anticipate to see our volumes improve relative to the market although we dont know if we will get all the way back to performing at market levels in the second quarter as we move into – and im going to stay on the volume theme for a moment here chris as we move into the second half of the year and we think that the market has digested the price increases as raw materials will have stabilized that at that point in time we will see our volume move back in line with at least in line with the market in the us so from a volume perspective thats our outlook for our business we do think that pricing is going to play an important role in whats going on in the industry as we move into the second and then into the second half of the year we really havent seen anything to suggest that people are not going to follow through with the pricing that theyve announced and put in there will be promotional activity as there always is but we think that there will be pricing in the market in line with whats happened with raw materials now as were looking at raw materials were talking our projection is that well see a modest increase in the second quarter and then a stabilization some of the more important commodities weve actually even seen the potential that there may be some decline as we move forward so well continue to monitor that for cooper in addition to the pricing and on margin improvement along with stable raw materials that we expect to see moving into the second half we continue to have a number of cost initiatives underway that we also think will contribute to our margin improvement christopher van horn  fbr capital markets  co great thanks for that color thats very helpful on the positive side the international markets did very well im wondering if you could just give us a little more detail i know you said europe and asia are both contributors but a little more detail on was one outsized versus the other and then was it oem versus replacement business and just what youre seeing in those marketplaces bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co yeah just to clarify a couple of the comments that i made in – it was in both but so if we talk about asia and europe specifically we talked about an  increase in domestic volumes in asia in the first quarter yearoveryear that was – it was both oem replacement but oe was clearly the stronger contributor to that growth in europe we had doubledigit increases close to  in that market and a lot of that driven by a stronger uk market which is important to our business both from a volume and a profit perspective along with an overall continuation of a refreshing of the product portfolio there and having more competitive products that are helping us in all of our markets in europe christopher van horn  fbr capital markets  co great thanks for the color guys ginger m jones  cooper tire  rubber co thank you chris operator our next question is from rod lache with deutsche bank please go ahead rod lache  deutsche bank securities inc good morning everybody ive had a couple things to follow up first was hoping to dive in a little bit more into this  drop in the us its because i dont recall certainly not recently any period of this magnitude of variance for you guys verse the industry so just in terms of a further explanation do you believe that its tire companies managing their pricing to fifo whereas you guys obviously have to face the lifo impact is the promotional activity centered in there any area like within lva or within certain brand tiers or are you seeing it pretty broadly bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co yeah so this is a more significant deviation from the industry although there is one example to this in my tenure here that goes back to  that was somewhat similar and i only raised that because at that time again we saw it was significant movements in raw materials tire companies making their pricing changes to respond to that and the timing and the implementation of it was a bit choppy there as well and it hit us for a couple of months we responded and moved back in line with the market in a relatively short order i cant say that this will be exactly the same situation but we do have confidence that we know how to respond to what were seeing with regard to lifo i cant comment on what other people do certainly we are incentivized to respond as early as we can because we are seeing the impact in our profitability from increases in raw materials sooner than others that are not on lifo which to my knowledge were the only ones on lifo in the us so there is clearly an incentive for us to move earlier however we also are looking at the market and trying to remain marketfacing as wed looked at some of the announcements that came out in the early part of the quarter we jumped on those and jumped in with our price increase with an anticipation about how those would be implemented and how the rest of the industry would follow as it turns out we ended up implementing effective march  and others even some that implemented march  may have protected orders through the end of the quarter to try and drive some volume several others announced price increases that werent effective until april or may there was promotional activity that came in behind some of the price increases so there were a number of things that were moving around i think the important points though rod are one there is pricing and it does look like the pricing is going to remain in the market well see during this quarter the next couple of months to finalize that comment but it does appear that thats the case and as thats coming into line and as we have better insights into what our key competitors are doing on key segments were realigning where were at to make sure that were appropriately marketfacing with our pricing and as weve done that as i mentioned its a little bit early but weve seen a nice response in our orders so far in april so i wouldnt say that its honed in on any particular segment in terms of the activity i just think this is the way that it has to happen as various competitors are coming in with their own unique approaches to pricing but once thats in place we still have the same competitive product lineup weve had and we still know how to position ourselves and we still have great relationships with our customers rod lache  deutsche bank securities inc great and in terms of the raw material cost inflation that youre expecting for the year if raw stay stable at this level is it still just under about  million impact for you guys on a full year basis and do you still believe that raw material costs could be fully offset for you guys in the back half bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well we havent quantified the dollar impact of the raw materials were staying with the guidance that we provide on the raw material index and again there will be timing that will affect this but we continue to believe that the industry given that the backdrop of a balanced supply and demand and even in undersupply relative to the demand for hva products that the pricing environment is such that we would expect the industry is going to price to recover increases in raw materials albeit with a lag rod lache  deutsche bank securities inc okay but earlier i think on the last call you were pretty explicit in saying that you thought that by the back half price and mix will fully offset the raw materials if i remember correctly is there less conviction in that or is that still a goal bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co no again we think that that is still on a reasonable outlook right now based on what we can see and again i know that weve said this a number of times but we are reaffirming our guidance around margins for the full year and including the second half rod lache  deutsche bank securities inc right okay thank you operator our next question is from brett hoselton with keybanc please go ahead brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc good morning bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co hi brett brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc on the topic of the volume can you talk about the first quarter kind of on monthbymonth basis i mean it seems like thats something that would have maybe impacted the latter perhaps half of the quarter as opposed to january and february bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co i would suggest that the volume trend was impacted by the pricing were making that point in this discussion and our pricing went into effect march  and not everybody else went at that point in time and so yeah as the pricing announcements came out and the way that those were executed was better understood by the market it began to have an effect and so i would say that its accurate to think that the latter part of the quarter was more affected brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc and as we look at kind of april i mean were largely through april at this point in time how can you assess how things have maybe improved here in the second quarter thus far bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well what we can monitor brett is our order pattern i mean thats what we can see and so as were looking at how the orders are coming in for us relative to a year ago and relative to the first quarter were indicating that were seeing improving trends unless theres a real significant change in whats going on in the overall industry which we wouldnt have view to yet we think that that will suggest that our performance is improving relative to the industry brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then switching gears here as i think about your guidance and the reversal of the tariff truck tariff how should i think about – that normally wouldve had a – i think a pretty material positive impact on your guidance here i think were basically if i remember correctly reiterating your guidance so what would be the offset would it primarily be a weaker than expected first quarter and second quarter bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well theres like a few factors that play here brett firstly when we talked about the tariff initially when we believed there was going to be a tariff in place we indicated at that time that we thought that the industry would take some pricing as a result of that given the supply and demand of the tbr market for the us that there would be some pricing that would be taken so as were looking at the tariff going away were now also reevaluating what those pricing assumptions should look like with regard to our roadmaster brand here in the us in addition there will be presumably additional competition in the market as were not the only one that will benefit from that tariff going away and so were assessing that and then frankly as were evaluating the overall not just tbr but the overall volume and pricing and raw material environment weve chosen to be a little bit conservative about the way that were looking at the second half of the year in terms of the guidance because on a net basis that tariff change is a benefit for us but were looking at it a little bit more cautiously right now given what weve seen happen in the first and the second quarter ginger m jones  cooper tire  rubber co yeah and brett i would add also the other thing that wasnt known when we set that guidance originally was obviously the positive benefit of the tariff but also the negative impact of the tornado so that we should also factor in as you think about onetime both positive and negatives for the year brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc and then just as i think about their margin in sequentially here i mean adjusting for some of the unusual items your operating margin is kind of around  or something along those lines to get into that low s percent or get into the s percent or something like that youre obviously expecting some margin expansion into the second quarter and then kind of well above the  range to kind of average out of around  for the full year is that – generally my understanding and more importantly is that primarily – it sounds like primarily pricing is going to be the major driver of that improvement going forward bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co im not sure id put the adjectives on we didnt use the adjective you used but yes were expecting our margins to improve as we go into the second quarter and that clearly is driven by a stabilization of the raw materials and having the full effect of a price increase that we just implemented in march through three months of the second quarter but there are other things that are going on as i mentioned earlier we do have cost reduction initiatives in place we are expecting to see a continuation in the growth of volume in markets outside of the us or north america and that will have some margin improvement along with it in terms of its overall contribution and we are expecting we did indicate that were seeing an improvement and were expecting an improvement in the us volumes so all of those things are going to contribute and i missed one we continue to see improvements in mix as well both in terms of just overall product mix but also in terms of specifically those hva categories that weve referred to brett d hoselton  keybanc capital markets inc excellent thank you very much brad thank you ginger ginger m jones  cooper tire  rubber co thank you brett operator our next question is from ryan brinkman with jpmorgan please go ahead ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for taking my question i noted in the press release that you mentioned that raw material costs are expected to increase modestly in the second quarter before then stabilizing throughout the balance of the year are you referring there to what you recognize in your pl or to spot prices i ask because it seems like from some of the metrics that were able to track that natural rubber and butadiene have declined in april and im just trying to understand if your margin guidance assumes that raw material prices do not decline from their highs bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well the first part of the question ryan it is our index it isnt necessarily precisely what you see flow through our cost of goods sold for raw materials but we think that its directionally a good indicator of what you should see and as we indicated in the discussion earlier sequentially that raw material index increased january february and march were looking at the same data that you are looking at in terms of some of the commodity prices out there and then the timing of when that is going to end up affecting that raw material index is a little bit of a factor in this but we are seeing the same thing that youre seeing ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then it seems like you lost significant share in march right in the us after you increased your prices but competitors announced increases that would take effect later i guess kind of creating their own sort of prevalues  in surveying what increases have been announced by whom it appears that some increases did take place on april  just after the quarter closed and that some others will take place next week on may  so the question is did your share already start to recover after the april  increases and thats kind of whats giving you the confidence that your volume performance will improve relative to the industry as the year progresses or are you still waiting to see recovery in share until more of the competitor hikes are implemented bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well we dont have complete data right now what we do have visibility to is our order patterns so far in the month of april and thats what in large part what were basing our statement on in terms of weve seen an improvement order activity and that we think that were going to improve our performance relative to the industry that is with some – with a necessity that we think a little bit about what the industry is going to look like for the second quarter but we dont have full details yet but it does – again what were seeing right now is improved from what we were seeing and thats with most of the increases in and not all of them yet in ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just last question from me on manufacturing costs and overhead i mean manufacturing at least was a  million headwind in the quarter how should we think about the production costs that you implemented in q impacting overhead absorption going forward is there anything we need to be mindful of about the second quarter or anything like that bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well we are going to continue to make sure that we dont get into an inventory problem so to the extent that we need to adjust our production schedule to ensure that that doesnt happen we will do that as we see an improvement in our volumes and as we move into the second half of the year i would expect that that  million will reduce and then not repeat but again that will be determined as we go through the year i would note and its a little unfortunate that its washed out by what we needed to do from a scheduling standpoint but we are making improvements in our overall manufacturing costs unfortunately they were more than overwhelmed by the days that we took out of the schedule ryan brinkman  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for all the color bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co thanks ryan i think we got time operator for one more call so maybe this could be the final call your final question excuse me operator sure our last question comes from bret jordan with jefferies please go ahead david l kelley  jefferies llc hey good morning this is david kelley in for bret thanks for squeezing me in here ill keep it brief i guess if were isolating the us aftermarket it sounds like really the entire sector experienced a weaker q largely due to what i think people are attributing it to mild winter weather here i guess is that something you observed as well and are you seeing or expect to see maybe an uptick in us demand in the second quarter given some of the deferred replacement and maybe higher miles driven weve seen over the last couple years or so bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co yes david what weve said in our comments here is that we do believe its the overall industry in terms of the sellout to the end consumer was weaker in the first quarter thats from some of the information that we have available and frankly monitoring comments from others including in your industry and well see what happens in the second quarter there were some factors in the first quarter that may have affected that that may not be as significant as we move into the second quarter overall when you look at some of the important variables that in the past have been good indicators about whats going to happen with replacement tire volumes like miles driven like where gas prices are those things all seem to suggest that there should be some recovery as we look forward over the balance of the year and we hope to see that but youre right in the first quarter we believe that the industry did see a weaker sellout environment david l kelley  jefferies llc okay great and then final word from me just a quick highlevel question weve seen significant mix shift in us new vehicle demand the light trucks and suvs and kind of away from the passenger cars since  those vehicles are beginning to roll off warranty and into the aftermarket seems like replacement cycles including tire replacements beginning to kick in here maybe if you could just talk about how you view that opportunity the product mix shift there over the next several years as we see that ramp up in mix shift bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co well youre right in terms of the tos and fros of the auto industry clearly the last several years youve seen a recovery in the light truck and the suv market we believe and i think that well recognize we have a very strong product lineup to support that part of the market its a place that we have earned i think a welldeserved reputation for the products that we provide and so i would look to that as being an opportunity for cooper david l kelley  jefferies llc all right great appreciate it thanks again for squeezing me in here bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co thanks david bradley e hughes  cooper tire  rubber co okay with that i think im going to move to my closing remarks and then first of all i want to thank you all for being on the call with us we do believe that cooper is wellpositioned to emerge in a strong position from whats going to be a dynamic  as we continue to execute our strategic plan and leverage the strength of our business model as always if youve got additional questions or things that you want to dive into a little more deeply please contact jerry with any

serviced while you shop car and truck tires if youre looking for tires for your car or truck be sure to pick out a set thats right for your vehicle and driving conditions for the optimal performance at all times consider buying tires for the worst weather and driving conditions youre likely to encounter in a specific season and use walmarts tire finder to select the right size for your vehicle its a good idea to get multiple sets of tires for different seasons if you live in an area with extreme weather conditions winter tires winter tires are made with a softer compound and feature more rubber than summer tires they need to stay soft and flexible so they can grip the road better even in colder conditions when the temperature hits  degrees fahrenheit summer and allseason tires become hard and lose their effectiveness look for winter tires for better traction and safer handling in the cold months lawn and tractor tires when it comes to lawn and tractor tires there are three main kinds to choose from turf tires are the least aggressive of the three styles and are meant primarily for mowing your yard worksite also known as r tires are used on hard surfaces like asphalt concrete and gravel theyre a bit wider so they distribute the weight they re carrying more evenly which means less stress on the tire but also less traction theyre best used in dry conditions agriculture tires are the most aggressive of the three providing better traction for soft fields and loose dirt theyre recommended for working in the snow mud and general farm use trailer tires trailer tires arent like car and truck tires they don t need to be steered and arent connected to complex suspension steering and braking systems don t use car and truck tires on a trailer it s a safety hazard instead look for special trailer st tires they provide a heavyduty load capacity and the stiff sidewalls help to prevent your vehicle from swaying also they re designed for trailer wheels which are typically narrower than the wheels on a car atv tires the first step to choosing the right atv tire is knowing the type of terrain youll be riding on allpurpose tires are good for yearround riding in nonextreme conditions if you re going to be riding around in yards and woods and other normal terrain this is the tire for you sand tires are probably the most recognizable atv tires the rear tires look like paddles and the front tires provide a rib down the middles or sides to assist with steering you won t get far on the sand without these mud tires have deep thick lugs to offer traction and support in extreme mud conditions there are also motocross tires offering traction and speed for dirt race tracks with jumps offroad tires are great for everything from mountainous terrain to racing across a wideopen desert golf cart tires if you have your own golf cart youll eventually need to get new tires especially if you play a lot of golf modern golf cart tires are tubeless and come in a variety of sizes and tread patterns standard golf cart tires measure  inches tall outer diameter by  inches wide across the tread by  inches at the bead inner diameter theyre designated as nhs which means nonhighway service and arent designed to withstand heavy loads or high speeds tire accessories walmart makes it easy to shop for motor oil transmission fluid and car lubricants too when choosing motor
