n holland the troubles with lacan the troubles with lacan norman n holland  copyright  norman n holland all rights reserved     i can be quite blunt about it there are three major troubles with lacan his linguistics his psycholinguistics and his idea of child development let me take them one by one i     lacans most widely quoted maxim is the unconscious is structured like a language and like that sentence lacans whole oeuvre rests on a certain idea of language his proclaimed return to freud meant remedying freuds failure to use modern linguistics modern linguistics for lacan however means turnofthecentury linguisticsspecifically ferdinand de saussures the trouble is that very little of saussures linguistics stands up today after nearly a centurys work in linguistics for one thing saussure bases his theory on a division of language into langue and parole langue is the formal system of signs which is the way he imagines language and parole is peoples actual speaking the problem is that langue is not a real thing but some platonic ideal parole we see all around us but how would you define english or french or black english it is simply a construct quite arbitrary like trying to define what is american or unamerican and like such notions it is subject to unpleasant sociopolitical uses particularly in such cases as black english you could define english langue as the rules by which we make english sounds and sentences including lexicon rules but then you are playing an altogether different linguistic game you have gone far beyond saussure into chomskyan ideas of competence those rules we can indeed define and they are real as real as viruses or electrons but that is not saussure and not lacan     saussure and therefore lacan presents a second linguistic problem signifiers and signifieds for saussure language consists of signifiers signifying signifieds for saussure signifier and signified are bound together in the sign and a language consists of all its signs signifiers and signifieds he says are defined by what they are not by difference that is the sign tree is what it is because it is different from free it is not three not true and so on its signified the concept of a tree is not the concept of a bush not a vine different from the concept of a flower in short the sign is what it is because it is not any of the millions of other signs our language affords saussure therefore imaged language as a vast piece of paper with all the signifiers on one surface and all the signifieds on the other as you cut the paper marking these differences between one signifier and another one isolate particular signifiersignified pairs or signs     in effect saussure says language equals the dictionary as though i could understand french by memorizing larousse or in saussures more sophisticated version by memorizing all the binary polarities for all the words in the larousse dictionary indeed saussure says as much language exists in the form of a sum of impressions deposited in the brain of each member of a community almost like a dictionary of which identical copies have been distributed to each individual i think that is a very primitive conception of language reasonable for the s but not for the s it is a conception of language that really works at best for proper or common nouns like saussures examples tree and horse or for tightly codified terms like lacans cute example of the paired doors with men and women on them but what do you do with abstract words what signified comes to your mind when i say hope do you think it could be expressed as a system of differences as easily as the system of differences that defines the sound hope what do you do with open verbs like go do or prepositions like in or on the kind of words whose signifieds go on for page after page in the oed     i say this dictionary version of language works at best for common nouns but this is a very weak and inadequate view of even the individual word let me give you an example i can say i persuaded johns mother that john should go to college i can say i persuaded johns mother but i shouldnt say  i persuaded that john should go to college its not grammatical why because it is a property of the verb persuade that it takes a noun phrase as object plus a noun clause or some reduction of a noun clause it cannot take the noun clause unless the noun phrase is also there this is a marking of the verb persuade and this marking has to be in the lexicon for us to make sentences with that verb     similarly you can say i asked what time it was or you can say i wondered what time it was you can say i asked the time but its not grammatical to say  i wondered the time you can say it was asked what time it was but you shouldnt say  it was wondered what time it was this is another case where the verbs ask and wonder must have markings to indicate whether they can be made passive or whether they can take a simple noun phrase as object you can see a primitive form of this marking when our ordinary dictionaries mark a verb as transitive or intransitive or a noun as a proper noun but saussure doesnt even get to that level     there are many other problems with saussures linguistics how can such a model as saussures account for the constant change in language when contragate entered our political vocabulary did it readjust all the billions of patterns of difference from aal to zyxt how can you use saussures linguistics to explain ambiguity the old men and women does that mean old men and the old women or the old men and all the women the shooting of the hunters was terrible are we talking about a tragedy or were the deer lucky john hit the ball then herbert did herbert come to bat or to grief does saussures linguistics help at all with these questions     in general how can saussures dictionary conception of language model the way we combine words into sentences how does it explain your ability to understand a sentence you have never heard before indeed using saussure how do you deal with sentences at all how do you deal with the fact that even very young children can create complicated sentences they have never heard before and they can understand complex sentences they have never heard before how can you account for these facts using only signifiers and signifieds already shaky as concepts even at the level of single words     you may well recognize those last questions i am simply asking the same questions that noam chomsky asked about phrasestructure grammars thirty years ago it was he who in  finally refuted saussure and the structural linguistics that developed from saussure chomsky turned linguistics to what what he calls the real and much harder problems for example what constitutes knowledge of a language     notice how chomsky has focused on language as a psychological phenomenon by contrast saussure treats language as a phenomenon out there in some sort of platonic space apart from the humans who use it     saussure built his linguistics on the unit of the word one part of chomskys  revolution in linguistics was to change that unit of analysis to the sentence he made his wellknown demand that a grammar should be able to generate all and only the wellformed sentences of a language saussure does not even come close to this target     long before chomsky however linguists realized that it would take something more than saussures linguistics to interrelate words in phrases and sentences as it happens some nineteenth century linguists hermann paul karl brugmann and william dwight whitney experimented with the idea of deep structures saussure knew of their work and there is at least one passage in students notes on saussures lectures where he seems himself under the influence of whitney to adopt the idea in his cours however he insists as we have seen on confining himself to the linguistic surface hence he was able to offer only a very primitive way of explaining how we put words together to form sentences     i find saussures idea of a sentence difficult to grasp he seems to conclude that one builds sentences along two natural co ordinates association and syntagms association groups words or inflections or any morpheme really according to meanings associations determine what is possible at any given slot in the sentence he defined the syntagm as consecutive signifiersignified units syntagmatics arranges elements in linear order thereby creating slots but one cannot according to saussure study word order apart from its concrete manifestations that is one cannot consider the slots apart from the words that actually fill them to think that there is an incorporeal syntax outside material units distributed in space would be a mistake thus he rules deep structure out in favor of the supposed reality of the mythical entity called english or french he rules out the very possibility of deep structure     furthermore the only syntagms in langue he proclaimed were pat phrases dictated by tradition things like good morning or il y a once a language fact depends on individual freedom we are in the realm of parole and for him the sentence     belongs to speaking parole not to language langue hence sentences are beyond his scope     chomsky sums saussures system up this way in saussurean structuralism a language langue was taken to be a system of sounds and an associated system of concepts the notion of sentence was left in a kind of limbo perhaps to be accommodated within the study of language use saussurean structuralism had placed    free expressions outside of the scope of the study of language structure of saussures langue as a result the fundamental question of the use and understanding of new sentences is left without any explanation     lacan apparently tried to deal with the problem of sentences in saussure by adding to saussure a linguistic idea of roman jakobsons enlarging on saussures brief and inconclusive remarks jakobson helped out with two principles to account for sentences it is obvious that we make sentences by putting one word after another first the man then hit then the then ball it is equally obvious that at any given point in that process we can substitute other words instead of the man we could say the woman or herbert instead of ball we could substitute other nouns or phrases to produce the man hit the child or the man hit the nail on the head or the man hit the road jakobson thus formalized saussures twoaxis model of sentence formation following saussure he named these two principles the paradigmatic the vertical axis of selection and the syntagmatic the horizontal axis of sequential combination at other times jakobson called the paradigmatic axis of section metaphor and the syntagmatic axis of sequential combination metonymy then lacan approximated jakobsons metonymy roughly sequence and metaphor roughly substitution to freuds condensation and displacement and in turn to other linguists syntagm and paradigm     jakobson was a distinguished linguist but he developed these particular ideas before chomskys  revolution in linguistics chomsky replaced jakobsons metaphor and metonymy with a far subtler system of transformations of kernel sentences a system that chomsky himself and many other linguists have still further sophisticated     lacan however stuck with jakobson even when writing long after  lacan seems to have preferred simple twovalued systems that is we have but two items metaphor and metonymy with which to account for sentence production we have but signifier and signified to account for language and we have but conscious and unconscious to model the mind     be that as it may jakobsons system doesnt account for the way we build sentences any more than saussures jakobson and saussure are describing what chomsky calls a finitestate grammar in such a grammar sentences are generated by means of a series of choices made from left to right that is to say after the first or leftmost element has been selected the probability of every subsequent choice is determined by the immediately preceding elements chomsky showed in  that none of these could in principle account for sentence production that is none could account for a sentence in which the selection of one element depends on the presence or absence of another element elsewhere in the sentence     consider the pair of sentences in chomskys well known example john is eager to please john is easy to please at first glance they look as though they were built along jakobsonian lines just substitute eager for easy but the underlying meanings are quite different in the first sentence john is active in the second passive in the first john is doing things in the second john is being done for but in the linguistic world of saussure jakobson and lacan the only difference between those two sentences is the difference between eager and easy     there are still more complex examples studied in the later phases of chomskys work the point is that identical phrasings can have quite different meanings depending on what comes before or after john is too angry to talk to bill john is too angry to talk to in one case john is doing the talking in the other someone other than john so that the seven signifiers is too angry to talk to mean quite different things in other words a given signifier can mean different things depending on other elements in the sentence similarly i wonder who the hunters expected to see them i wonder who the hunters expected to see in the first sentence the hunters are seen in the second they do the seeing the horse raced round the barn the horse raced round the barn fell in the first sentence the horse did the racing in the second someone else did     there is no need to belabor the point when we compose or understand sentences we use structures that deal with more than the surface produced we use rules in which the choice of words in one part of a sentence is dictated by the choice of words in an earlier or later part furthermore these structures can be exceedingly complex i would find it quite impossible to say for the hunters sentences how i know that the first them refers to the hunters themselves     saussure did not recognize that any formal account of language strong enough to deal with sentences and discourse to say nothing of a psychological account of humans using language has to include more systems than just a lexicon it also and most importantly has to include the interactions among these different systems saussures account of language deals only with surface features and makes no provision for deep structures or transformations between deep and surface structures saussure has no way for example of declaring any sentence grammatical or non grammatical however a language is structured it is not structured the way saussure says it is nor do jakobsons metonymy and metaphor take us further     that is the first trouble with lacan lacan goes wrong by relying quite uncritically on saussures signifiersignified conception of language it is understandable that lacan when he began to write in the s should learn saussures turnofthecentury linguistics but even at the end of his life he and now his followers write about signifiers and signifieds as though the chomskyan revolution in linguistics had never happened contemporary literary theorists tirelessly quote saussure but why todays linguists no more use saussures model than todays physicists use the concept of phlogiston     i do not mean to suggest that linguists have all adopted chomskys views they are still controversial and he would be the first to acknowledge that they are subject to revision in the light of further evidence linguists who reject chomskys ideas however are trying to offer alternatives or to go beyond chomsky they are not turning back to saussure my point is not that chomsky is right but that saussure and lacan are wrong     chomsky is not being unduly harsh when he calls saussures linguistics an impoverished and thoroughly inadequate conception of language at best adequate for its time but finally leading to unimportant research and feedback a theory like saussures that language understanding is purely semantic reports mitchell marcus is fundamentally inadequate to process the full range of natural language and held by no current researchers to my knowledge in writing this essay for example i had trouble finding linguistic texts that even refer to saussure saussures views are not held so far as i know by modern linguists only by literary critics lacanians and the occasional philosopher wrong on a grand scale cognitive linguist mark turner calls it them and it has elicited wrong film and literary theory on a grand scale one can find dozens of books of literary theory bogged down in signifiers and signifieds but only a handful that even mention chomsky     it will be saidit has been said to me by lacanian friendsthat this objection to lacan that he uses a mistaken and outmoded linguistics does not count because lacan only uses saussure for his own psychological purposes saussure is only a metaphor in lacans thinking lacan brought him in to establish himself in the parisian intellectual community     i find this justification unconvincing for two reasons first it does not fit our use of metaphor when we use a metaphor to understand somethng we use something we understand well to understand something we understand less well we take an idea from a wellunderstood source domain to understand a more puzzling target domain if i say life is a journey i use something i am familiar with and understand quite well journeys to understand something more mysterious life i can then model difficulties in my life as obstacles in the path or choices as forks in road and so on even so simple a metaphor can become quite sophisticated as in robert frosts wellknown lines two roads diverged in a wood and i  i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference but this is not what lacan does when he uses saussure he uses a still mysterious subject language to understand a subject that freud and many others have made understandable namely unconscious processes rather than clarify an opacity in psychoanalysis he has made it more opaque and arcane it would be strange indeed to claim that lacan explains things clearly     furthermore his account of his source domain language is wrong what happens to our use of metaphor to explore an unknown if the source term is an error or an illusion for example suppose our original notion of journeys was that they all take place in elevators up and down not across roads toward destinations what happens then even to a familiar metaphor like life is a journey it stops making sense ideas of crossroads or forks in the road or obstacles cannot help us understand life at all the same is true of lacans use of saussure it does not help us understand unconscious processes at allor at least no better than freuds and others direct accounts it has also been said to me particularly by french analysts that now lacan has been passed that lacan is only important and in that he bought france to an awareness of psychoanalysis he could not have done so except by using saussure and the structural linguistics popular when lacan began to make a difference in french intellectual life i find this justification as odd as the other are we to take lacan seriously as thinker because he is a popularizer further to what kind of psychoanalysis has he led french psychoanalysts some french psychoanalysts that is to a psychoanalysis that is more philosophy than psychology to abstract and metaphysical reasoning far removed from clinical experience and that brings me to lacans second trouble his psycholinguistics ii     lacan presents psycholinguistic problems as well as linguistic even if chomsky were all wrong lacan has made a still more fundamental error in psychologizing saussures account of language over and over again lacan claims that linguistic entities are in fact psychological entities the most notorious instance where he converts a linguistic entity to a psychological one is of course signifier and signified lacan identifies the signifier pretty with the conscious and saussures signified with freuds unconscious then the linguistic barre that saussure posited between signifier and signified lacan equates to freuds repression     as we have seen lacan approximates jakobsons metonymy roughly sequence and jakobsons metaphor roughly substitution to freuds condensation and displacement and in turn to other linguists syntagm and paradigm in other words what he does is say that these linguistic entitities are in fact psychological entities     similarly the barre saussure posited between signifier and signified comes to equal freuds repression the linguists barre becomes the psychoanalysts bar between conscious and unconscious and the signifier cannot cross it the hidden signifieds are the unconscious and the signifiers are the empty speech with which we try to express as in free associations our real unconscious selves we necessarily fail because signifiers signify other signifiers not signifieds conscious and unconscious are thus opposed in one of lacans twovalued systems     in effect lacan renders all psychic determinism as the single linguistic process of a signifier signifying other signifiers thats quite a role for a process that modern linguists doubt even exists     the major place where lacan converts a linguistic entity to a psychological one is of course with signifier and signified lacan identifies the signifier pretty closely with the conscious and saussures signified with freuds unconscious then he modifies saussure with what he regards as the essence of freuds discoveries the barre which equals repression and marks off conscious from unconscious écrits write benvenuto and kennedy of lacans cornerstone book is fundamentally concerned with the laws of the signifier the essence of freuds discovery is lacan himself writes that the displacement of the signifier determines the subjects in their acts in their destiny in their refusals their blind spots their end and fate their innate gifts and social acquisitions    without regard for character or sex and that willingly or not everything that might be considered the stuff of psychology kit and caboodle will follow the path of the signifier  in effect lacan renders all psychic determinism as the single linguistic process of signification thats quite a role for a process that modern linguists doubt even exists     what is fascinating to me about this maneuver is that it exactly reverses the assumption that saussure had to make when he set out to build his linguistics saussure knew that a psychological account of our use of language was beyond him or anybody else in the s he sensibly chose to ignore the human element anyway he wanted to develop a formal account of language to give language first place in the study of speech as saussure tells us at the beginning and end of his lectures his aim was to free linguistics from ethnography social or individual psychology physiology philology and everything else that is not linguistics he wanted to model language in purely linguistic terms the true and unique object of linguistics is language studied in and for itself from the very outset we must put both feet on the ground of language le terrain de la langue and use language as the norm of all other manifestations of speech he wanted a linguistics that would account for language strictly as language that would have nothing to do with the way real people use language     he simply and briefly assumed an associationist psychology which was adequate for his purposes the psychological association of the soundimage with the corresponding concept he just posited signifying somehow physical sounds or differences in physical sounds convert into psychological concepts or differences in psychological concepts it doesnt matter how signifiers simply evoke signifieds automatically a given difference in sound imprints a certain arbitrarily connected difference in sense meaning thus becomes meaningoutthere in language wherever that is not meaninginhere in our minds then once saussure had bracketed the human element he could go on to develop his purely formal account of language the assumption enabled him to found structural linguistics but it has no psychological credibility at all     saussure deliberately dropped out the human element in saussures model a signifiers difference from other signifiers simply imprints a difference from other ideas in the hearers mind and this is where saussure thinks he eludes psychology he has only swept it under the rug though hiding the psychological process in the word imprints saussures signifying far from being something the theorist of literature or film can take for granted rests on a highly questionable but unexamined set of psychological premises     chomsky notes as i do the links between behaviorist psychology and this structural linguistics both structural linguistics and behaviorist psychology avoid the notion of the active or autonomous individual in favor of a subject subject to linguistic laws or stimulusresponse laws in  chomsky correctly identified as i am doing the structural linguistics that derives from saussure as radical behaviorist reductionism it is an extreme stimulusresponse behaviorist picture of the mind that among psychologists even the most devout of skinnerians might not endorse     now comes lacan and confuses matters further saussure was trying to depsychologize linguistics but lacan re psychologizes saussures linguistics lacan is using a formal theory of language to explain empirical events in the mind saussure was trying precisely not to say what goes on in your or my mind when we understand a word or make up a sentence and within the limits of his theory he succeeded lacan however applies saussures carefully apsychological theory to describe precisely what it avoided describing      to be sure lacan radically changes saussure lacan changes the signifierssignified relation for him signifiers do not point to signifieds but to other signifiers but what lacan does not change is the principle that signifiers signify that remains axiomatic lacan retains the basic idea that the signifier does things     in lacanian psychoanalysis the structuralists behaviorist notion of signification still prevails its inventor saussure never meant it to be a psychological process and modern linguists no longer take it seriously nevertheless lacan substitutes signification for association memory learning and ultimately all other psychological processes the chain of signifiers running along according to its own laws determines the i and the determinism is total says lacan what results is a psychoanalysis which is really underneath a stimulusresponse behaviorism lacan by combining saussures linguistics with freud makes freud into the s psychologies that saussure had sense enough to avoid     when saussure or lacan following him equates a formal description of language to the psychology of languageusers he makes the entailings of formal linguistics into stimulusresponse in the mind it is easy to see what has gone wrong if we consider arithmetic instead of language in a formal sense adding one to the first number generates all the rest of the integers yes in a purely formal way n n n    signifies all the whole positive numbers but that generates or signifies does not describe what goes on in your mind or mine when we count         presenting n to us does not stimulate the set of integral numbers in our minds     neither does tree stimulate a concept of a tree the process of understanding language is far more complex chomsky followed his  rebuttal of phrasestructure grammars in syntactic structures with a devastating review in  of b f skinners verbal behavior a book that attempted to explain human language skills in behaviorist terms in both instances chomsky showed that it is both logically and empirically impossible to account for language proficiency in terms of stimulusresponse chains yet that is just what lacan assumes     saussure formalized language as a sheet of signifying differences mapped onto a sheet of signified differences whatever its linguistic credibility and that is very limited in  this idea of signifying entails a radically behaviorist stimulusresponse psychology of language     despite the claims of a return to freud and the psychoanalytic subjectmatter lacan by repsychologizing saussure posits a linguistic stimulusresponse of the most radical kind in other words lacan assumes that language combines and recombines itself apart from the speaking subject whatever his other changes from saussure he keeps the premise that words are the active ones in the psychological or more precisely the psycholinguistic process it is language that means not readers or hearers who make meaning the chain of signifiers running along according to its own laws determines the i and the determinism is total says lacan or perhaps we should call it as raymond tallis does the dance of signifiers the lacancan     not only does lacans claim make the philosophical error of using saussures formal description of language psychology as if it were an empirical one he is also wrong on empirical grounds that is i cannot think of a serious psycholinguist who would agree with saussures or lacans account of the way we understand language     indeed todays cognitive science shows the opposite words do not simply imprint meanings on our minds as saussure thought words require considerable processing for example through schemata and feedback loops any elementary textbook in the psychology of reading or the psychology of language would make this clear the only justification for saussures and lacans idea that signifiers impose themselves on persons is the apparently compelling need of some intellectuals to feel that the individual is not autonomous their account is simply and unequivocally false by todays standards     for one thing it is too simple where our knowledge of the architecture and chemistry of the brain would suggest continuum and flow and feedback lacan substitutes abrupt discontinuities simple yesnos where bothand makes sense lacan substitutes eitheror and becomes able to write paradoxes the paradoxes result from lacans replacing a more complex systems model language with saussures twovalued account of language as differences in signifiers signifying differences in signifieds it is saussures barre which justifies lacans idea of the split and alienated self but the barre is not a good linguistic concept and psychologists psychoanalysts and psycholinguists do not regard the self as split     rather it is clear to me that lacans insistence on a split and selfalientated self contradicts an experience familiar to anyone in analysis one of the things you learn on the couch is that your ordinary conscious activities express and partially fulfill deep early and unconscious wishes     it is precisely that experience that lacan denies in doing so he claims to be rescuing psychoanalysis from the ego psychologists whom he portrays as preaching adaptation to society and fleeing the subversive truths discovered by freud a that is lacan misreads heinz hartmanns biological concept of adaptation as a social one but in fact what lacan has done is convert freuds complex truths into a simple yesno onoff binary system he has left no place for sublimation     to be sure saussures allornothing sound concept dichotomies have a certain modish appeal they are certainly easier to understand than chomskys and postchomskyan models but they are no substitute for the human element in explaining how we create and understand language they lead to a false psychology and a false psychoanalysis     when lacan gives to saussures formal model of language a psychological validity lacan builds his thinking on the idea of a selfrunning language finally that renders his thought profoundly anti psychoanalytic iii     i have concentrated on lacans use of the false and outmoded linguistics of saussure because it seems to me central to his system similar problems attach to another fundamental lacanian concept the mirror stage as a concept it is analogous to selfobject differentiation in ordinary psychoanalysis in ordinary psychoanalysis though selfobject differentiation leaves the child with an identity while in lacan it leaves the child with a basic lack of being     the child says lacan identifies with its mirror imageand lacan insists on an actual mirror not some mirroring behavior from a parent that is how the child forms an ego the illusion of autonomy lacan claims a uniform or continuing process from six to eighteen months he claims that throughout these twelve months the infant can recognize his own image any time in that period as such that is to say the infant recognizes that the image in the mirror is an image of the infant himself lacan then goes on to claim that the infant makes a judgment namely that this image is unified coherent more so than the infant the infant believes that he is capable of controlling it finally lacan claims that the infant recognizes the image and makes these judgment before speech lacan writes of this jubilant assumption of his specular image by the child at the infans stage still sunk in his motor incapacity and nursling dependence    the i is precipitated in a primordial form before    language restores to it    its function as subject     but what is the evidence for such a mirror stage as usual lacan pays precious little attention to evidence he mentions neither experimental evidence nor clinical material instead he cites a  book by wolfgang köhler on the behavior of chimpanzees he refers without telling you what it is to james mark baldwins book on child development from      now this may be reasonable for lacan after all he was inventing the mirror stage in  and he may not have had access to any better data but what about lacanians of today i have yet to see a lacanian refer to the careful videotapes of infant behavior by daniel stern or margaret mahlers direct observation of nine infants behavior with mirrors or indeed the score or more of articles on infants behavior in front of mirrors that even a cursory search of psychological abstracts turns up     when we look at these more sophisticated studies we find that there is no evidence whatsoever for lacans notion of a mirror stage what we find is that infants behavior in front of mirrors is not a uniform process during the period from six to eighteen months as lacan claims it is true that children uniformly show pleasure in playing with and responding to their own mirror images throughout the period from three to twentyfour months what they respond pleasurably to is what is called contingent behavior that is the child can make the image in the mirror move the same way it can swat a mobile over its crib and make it move children enjoy demonstrating that kind of power at age eight to nine months the infant uses mirrors to reach for objects for other people and for itself that is the infant realizes that the image is an image and it has some sense of the geometry of reflection according to margaret mahlers observations from twelve to eighteen months chldren identify the image as itself by pointing naming or by saying the personal pronoun in the more precise experiments by jeanne brooksgunn and michael lewislewis brooks lewis brooksgunn jaskir  using rouge spots surreptitiously placed on the face by fifteen months and not before children begin to identify the image in the mirror as themselves and they begin to exhibit selfconscious behavior they pose for example they do not show the jubiliation lacan claims in sum up to fifteen months no children pass the rouge test and by twentyfour months all normal children have passed the rouge test there is by the way a similar sequence of behaviors for children seeing themselves on video monitors or in videotapes but slower     this is quite a different picture from lacan by the time children can recognize their mirror images as themselves most of them have already started using language children seem nervous and self conscious in front of this recognized image not jubilant as lacan claims there is no sign that the child makes a judgment that this image is unified or in some sense more powerful or otherwise different from self indeed how could there be a sign of such a thing what the child is finding out is that the image in fact reflects the self     in short there is no evidence for lacans notion of a mirror stage indeed what evidence we have runs rather the other way as i say perhaps lacan knew no better in  but why do presentday lacanians go on quoting this mishmash of conjecture and false assertions     the same objection applies to lacans linguisterie why do lacanians keep on talking about signifiers and signifieds and the system erected upon them a simple look at the encyclopedia brittannica article on linguistics or any elementary textbook on linguistics would show that all this signifiersignified stuff is outmoded and wrong iv     finally then i think there are two things to remember one whenever you hear the terms signifier signified or signifying in saussures sense whenever you hear metaphor or metonymy in jakobsons sense you are dealing with a weak outmoded and finally incorrect linguistics you have found the weak point in the argument and you can dig in at that point if you wish to topple it all these moves that assume text active models of literary response are simply disguises for an oldfashioned stimulusresponse psychology or more accurately a stimulusresponse psycholinguistics that simply wont hold water     the second thing is that lacan is profoundly anti psychoanalytic when lacan adopts saussures idea of signifying he drops all of us out he drops us out of speaking out of understanding language or out of feeling roused by a poem or a movie he drops us out of understanding one another understanding oneself and out of psychoanalyzing and being psychoanalyzed it is one thing for saussure to drop out the human element he did not want to try to do psychology but what are we to say of a psychoanalyst who does not want to do psychology and what can such a psychoanalysis contribute to literature philosophy or quite simply our understanding of the world around and within us notes  for an excellent

you are likely to meet with a blank look even worse you might be asked to define what semiotics is  which would be a bit tricky if you were looking for a beginners guide its worse still if you do know a bit about semiotics because it can be hard to offer a simple definition which is of much use in the bookshop if youve ever been in such a situation youll probably agree that its wise not to ask semiotics could be anywhere the shortest definition is that it is the study of signs but that doesnt leave enquirers much wiser what do you mean by a sign people usually ask next the kinds of signs that are likely to spring immediately to mind are those which we routinely refer to as signs in everyday life such as road signs pub signs and star signs if you were to agree with them that semiotics can include the study of all these and more people will probably assume that semiotics is about visual signs you would confirm their hunch if you said that signs can also be drawings paintings and photographs and by now theyd be keen to direct you to the art and photography sections but if you are thickskinned and tell them that it also includes words sounds and body language they may reasonably wonder what all these things have in common and how anyone could possibly study such disparate phenomena if you get this far theyve probably already read the signs which suggest that you are either eccentric or insane and communication may have ceased assuming that you are not one of those annoying people who keeps everyone waiting with your awkward question if you are searching for books on semiotics you could do worse than by starting off in the linguistics section it is possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life it would form part of social psychology and hence of general psychology we shall call it semiology from the greek semeîon sign it would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them since it does not yet exist one cannot say for certain that it will exist but it has a right to exist a place ready for it in advance linguistics is only one branch of this general science the laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge saussure   saussure   thus wrote the swiss linguist ferdinand de saussure  a founder not only of linguistics but also of what is now more usually referred to as semiotics in his course in general linguistics  other than saussure the usual abbreviation key figures in the early development of semiotics were the american philosopher charles sanders peirce sic pronounced purse  and later charles william morris  who developed a behaviourist semiotics leading modern semiotic theorists include roland barthes  algirdas greimas  yuri lotman  christian metz  umberto eco b  and julia kristeva b  a number of linguists other than saussure have worked within a semiotic framework such as louis hjelmslev  and roman jakobson  it is difficult to disentangle european semiotics from structuralism in its origins major structuralists include not only saussure but also claude lévistrauss b  in anthropology who saw his subject as a branch of semiotics and jacques lacan  in psychoanalysis structuralism is an analytical method which has been employed by many semioticians and which is based on saussures linguistic model structuralists seek to describe the overall organization of sign systems as languages  as with lévistrauss and myth kinship rules and totemism lacan and the unconscious and barthes and greimas and the grammar of narrative they engage in a search for deep structures underlying the surface features of phenomena however contemporary social semiotics has moved beyond the structuralist concern with the internal relations of parts within a selfcontained system seeking to explore the use of signs in specific social situations modern semiotic theory is also sometimes allied with a marxist approach which stresses the role of ideology semiotics began to become a major approach to cultural studies in the late s partly as a result of the work of roland barthes the translation into english of his popular essays in a collection entitled mythologies barthes  followed in the s and s by many of his other writings greatly increased scholarly awareness of this approach writing in  barthes declared that semiology aims to take in any system of signs whatever their substance and limits images gestures musical sounds objects and the complex associations of all of these which form the content of ritual convention or public entertainment these constitute if not languages at least systems of signification barthes   the adoption of semiotics in britain was influenced by its prominence in the work of the centre for contemporary cultural studies cccs at the university of birmingham whilst the centre was under the direction of the neomarxist sociologist stuart hall director  although semiotics may be less central now within cultural and media studies at least in its earlier more structuralist form it remains essential for anyone in the field to understand it what individual scholars have to assess of course is whether and how semiotics may be useful in shedding light on any aspect of their concerns note that saussures term semiology is sometimes used to refer to the saussurean tradition whilst semiotics sometimes refers to the peircean tradition but that nowadays the term semiotics is more likely to be used as an umbrella term to embrace the whole field nöth   semiotics is not widely institutionalized as an academic discipline it is a field of study involving many different theoretical stances and methodological tools one of the broadest definitions is that of umberto eco who states that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign eco   semiotics involves the study not only of what we refer to as signs in everyday speech but of anything which stands for something else in a semiotic sense signs take the form of words images sounds gestures and objects whilst for the linguist saussure semiology was a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life for the philosopher charles peirce semiotic was the formal doctrine of signs which was closely related to logic peirce   for him a sign is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity peirce   he declared that every thought is a sign peirce   cf ff ff contemporary semioticians study signs not in isolation but as part of semiotic sign systems such as a medium or genre they study how meanings are made as such being concerned not only with communication but also with the construction and maintenance of reality semiotics and that branch of linguistics known as semantics have a common concern with the meaning of signs but john sturrock argues that whereas semantics focuses on what words mean semiotics is concerned with how signs mean sturrock   for c w morris deriving this threefold classification from peirce semiotics embraced semantics along with the other traditional branches of linguistics semantics the relationship of signs to what they stand for syntactics or syntax the formal or structural relations between signs pragmatics the relation of signs to interpreters morris   semiotics is often employed in the analysis of texts although it is far more than just a mode of textual analysis here it should perhaps be noted that a text can exist in any medium and may be verbal nonverbal or both despite the logocentric bias of this distinction the term text usually refers to a message which has been recorded in some way eg writing audio and videorecording so that it is physically independent of its sender or receiver a text is an assemblage of signs such as words images sounds andor gestures constructed and interpreted with reference to the conventions associated with a genre and in a particular medium of communication the term medium is used in a variety of ways by different theorists and may include such broad categories as speech and writing or print and broadcasting or relate to specific technical forms within the mass media radio television newspapers magazines books photographs films and records or the media of interpersonal communication telephone letter fax email videoconferencing computerbased chat systems some theorists classify media according to the channels involved visual auditory tactile and so on nöth   human experience is inherently multisensory and every representation of experience is subject to the constraints and affordances of the medium involved every medium is constrained by the channels which it utilizes for instance even in the very flexible medium of language words fail us in attempting to represent some experiences and we have no way at all of representing smell or touch with conventional media different media and genres provide different frameworks for representing experience facilitating some forms of expression and inhibiting others the differences between media lead emile benveniste to argue that the first principle of semiotic systems is that they are not synonymous we are not able to say the same thing in systems based on different units in innis   in contrast to hjelmslev who asserted that in practice language is a semiotic into which all other semiotics may be translated cited in genosko   the everyday use of a medium by someone who knows how to use it typically passes unquestioned as unproblematic and neutral this is hardly surprising since media evolve as a means of accomplishing purposes in which they are usually intended to be incidental and the more frequently and fluently a medium is used the more transparent or invisible to its users it tends to become for most routine purposes awareness of a medium may hamper its effectiveness as a means to an end indeed it is typically when the medium acquires transparency that its potential to fulfil its primary function is greatest the selectivity of any medium leads to its use having influences of which the user may not always be conscious and which may not have been part of the purpose in using it we can be so familiar with the medium that we are anaesthetized to the mediation it involves we dont know what were missing insofar as we are numbed to the processes involved we cannot be said to be exercising choices in its use in this way the means we use may modify our ends amongst the phenomena enhanced or reduced by media selectivity are the ends for which a medium was used in some cases our purposes may be subtly and perhaps invisibly redefined by our use of a particular medium this is the opposite of the pragmatic and rationalistic stance according to which the means are chosen to suit the users ends and are entirely under the users control an awareness of this phenomenon of transformation by media has often led media theorists to argue deterministically that our technical means and systems always and inevitably become ends in themselves a common interpretation of marshall mcluhans famous aphorism the medium is the message and has even led some to present media as wholly autonomous entities with purposes as opposed to functions of their own however one need not adopt such extreme stances in acknowledging the transformations involved in processes of mediation when we use a medium for any purpose its use becomes part of that purpose travelling is an unavoidable part of getting somewhere it may even become a primary goal travelling by one particular method of transport rather than another is part of the experience so too with writing rather than speaking or using a word processor rather than a pen in using any medium to some extent we serve its purposes as well as it serving ours when we engage with media we both act and are acted upon use and are used where a medium has a variety of functions it may be impossible to choose to use it for only one of these functions in isolation the making of meanings with such media must involve some degree of compromise complete identity between any specific purpose and the functionality of a medium is likely to be rare although the degree of match may on most occasions be accepted as adequate i am reminded here of an observation by the anthropologist claude lévistrauss that in the case of what he called bricolage the process of creating something is not a matter of the calculated choice and use of whatever materials are technically bestadapted to a clearly predetermined purpose but rather it involves a dialogue with the materials and means of execution lévistrauss   in such a dialogue the materials which are readytohand may as we say suggest adaptive courses of action and the initial aim may be modified consequently such acts of creation are not purely instrumental the bricoleur speaks not only with things but also through the medium of things ibid  the use of the medium can be expressive the context of lévistrausss point was a discussion of mythical thought but i would argue that bricolage can be involved in the use of any medium for any purpose the act of writing for instance may be shaped not only by the writers conscious purposes but also by features of the media involved  such as the kind of language and writing tools used  as well as by the social and psychological processes of mediation involved any resistance offered by the writers materials can be an intrinsic part of the process of writing however not every writer acts or feels like a bricoleur individuals differ strikingly in their responses to the notion of media transformation they range from those who insist that they are in total control of the media which they use to those who experience a profound sense of being shaped by the media which use them chandler  norman fairclough comments on the importance of the differences between the various mass media in the channels and technologies they draw upon the press uses a visual channel its language is written and it draws upon technologies of photographic reproduction graphic design and printing radio by contrast uses an oral channel and spoken language and relies on technologies of sound recording and broadcasting whilst television combines technologies of sound and imagerecording and broadcasting these differences in channel and technology have significant wider implications in terms of the meaning potential of the different media for instance print is in an important sense less personal than radio or television radio begins to allow individuality and personality to be foregrounded through transmitting individual qualities of voice television takes the process much further by making people visually available and not in the frozen modality of newspaper photographs but in movement and action fairclough   whilst technological determinists emphasize that semiotic ecologies are influenced by the fundamental design features of different media it is important to recognize the importance of sociocultural and historical factors in shaping how different media are used and their evershifting status within particular cultural contexts for instance many contemporary cultural theorists have remarked on the growth of the importance of visual media compared with linguistic media in contemporary society and the associated shifts in the communicative functions of such media thinking in ecological terms about the interaction of different semiotic structures and languages led the russian cultural semiotician yuri lotman to coin the term semiosphere to refer to the whole semiotic space of the culture in question lotman   the concept is related to ecologists references to the biosphere and perhaps to cultural theorists references to the public and private spheres but most reminiscent of teilhard de chardins notion dating back to  of the noosphere  the domain in which mind is exercised whilst lotman referred to such semiospheres as governing the functioning of languages within cultures john hartley comments that there is more than one level at which one might identify a semiosphere  at the level of a single national or linguistic culture for instance or of a larger unity such as the west right up to the species we might similarly characterize the semiosphere of a particular historical period hartley   this conception of a semiosphere may make semioticians seem territorially imperialistic to their critics but it offers a more unified and dynamic vision of semiosis than the study of a specific medium as if each existed in a vacuum there are of course other approaches to textual analysis apart from semiotics  notably rhetorical analysis discourse analysis and content analysis in the field of media and communication studies content analysis is a prominent rival to semiotics as a method of textual analysis whereas semiotics is now closely associated with cultural studies content analysis is wellestablished within the mainstream tradition of social science research whilst content analysis involves a quantitative approach to the analysis of the manifest content of media texts semiotics seeks to analyse media texts as structured wholes and investigates latent connotative meanings semiotics is rarely quantitative and often involves a rejection of such approaches just because an item occurs frequently in a text does not make it significant the structuralist semiotician is more concerned with the relation of elements to each other a social semiotician would also emphasize the importance of the significance which readers attach to the signs within a text whereas content analysis focuses on explicit content and tends to suggest that this represents a single fixed meaning semiotic studies focus on the system of rules governing the discourse involved in media texts stressing the role of semiotic context in shaping meaning however some researchers have combined semiotic analysis and content analysis eg glasgow university media group  leiss et al  mcquarrie  mick  some commentators adopt c w morriss definition of semiotics in the spirit of saussure as the science of signs morris   the term science is misleading as yet semiotics involves no widelyagreed theoretical assumptions models or empirical methodologies semiotics has tended to be largely theoretical many of its theorists seeking to establish its scope and general principles peirce and saussure for instance were both concerned with the fundamental definition of the sign peirce developed elaborate logical taxonomies of types of signs subsequent semioticians have sought to identify and categorize the codes or conventions according to which signs are organized clearly there is a need to establish a firm theoretical foundation for a subject which is currently characterized by a host of competing theoretical assumptions as for methodologies saussures theories constituted a starting point for the development of various structuralist methodologies for analysing texts and social practices these have been very widely employed in the analysis of a host of cultural phenomena however such methods are not universally accepted sociallyoriented theorists have criticized their exclusive focus on structure and no alternative methodologies have as yet been widely adopted some semiotic research is empiricallyoriented applying and testing semiotic principles bob hodge and david tripp employed empirical methods in their classic study of children and television hodge  tripp  but there is at present little sense of semiotics as a unified enterprise building on cumulative research findings semiotics represents a range of studies in art literature anthropology and the mass media rather than an independent academic discipline those involved in semiotics include linguists philosophers psychologists sociologists anthropologists literary aesthetic and media theorists psychoanalysts and educationalists beyond the most basic definition there is considerable variation amongst leading semioticians as to what semiotics involves it is not only concerned with intentional communication but also with our ascription of significance to anything in the world semiotics has changed over time since semioticians have sought to remedy weaknesses in early semiotic approaches even with the most basic semiotic terms there are multiple definitions consequently anyone attempting semiotic analysis would be wise to make clear which definitions are being applied and if a particular semioticians approach is being adopted what its source is there are two divergent traditions in semiotics stemming respectively from saussure and peirce the work of louis hjelmslev roland barthes claude lévistrauss julia kristeva christian metz and jean baudrillard b  follows in the semiological tradition of saussure whilst that of charles w morris ivor a richards  charles k ogden  and thomas sebeok b  is in the semiotic tradition of peirce the leading semiotician bridging these two traditions is the celebrated italian author umberto eco who as the author of the bestseller the name of the rose novel  film  is probably the only semiotician whose film rights are of any value eco  saussure argued that nothing is more appropriate than the study of languages to bring out the nature of the semiological problem saussure   saussure   semiotics draws heavily on linguistic concepts partly because of the influence of saussure and because linguistics is a more established discipline than the study of other sign systems structuralists adopted language as their model in exploring a much wider range of social phenomena lévistrauss for myth kinship rules and totemism lacan for the unconscious barthes and greimas for the grammar of narrative julia kristeva declared that what semiotics has discovered is that the law governing or if one prefers the major constraint affecting any social practice lies in the fact that it signifies ie that it is articulated like a language cited in hawkes   saussure referred to language his model being speech as the most important of all of the systems of signs saussure   saussure   language is almost unvariably regarded as the most powerful communication system by far for instance marvin harris observes that human languages are unique among communication systems in possessing semantic universality a communication system that has semantic universality can convey information about all aspects domains properties places or events in the past present or future whether actual or possible real or imaginary cited in wilden   perhaps language is indeed fundamental emile benveniste observed that language is the interpreting system of all other systems linguistic and nonlinguistic in innis   whilst claude lévistrauss noted that language is the semiotic system par excellence it cannot but signify and exists only through signification lévistrauss   saussure saw linguistics as a branch of semiology linguistics is only one branch of this general science of semiology the laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics as far as we are concerned the linguistic problem is first and foremost semiological if one wishes to discover the true nature of language systems one must first consider what they have in common with all other systems of the same kind in this way light will be thrown not only upon the linguistic problem by considering rites customs etc as signs it will be possible we believe to see them in a new perspective the need will be felt to consider them as semiological phenomena and to explain them in terms of the laws of semiology saussure   saussure   whilst roland barthes declared that perhaps we must invert saussures formulation and assert that semiology is a branch of linguistics others have accepted saussures location of linguistics within semiotics barthes  xi other than himself jeanmarie floch instances hjelmslev and greimas floch   however even if we theoretically locate linguistics within semiotics it is difficult to avoid adopting the linguistic model in exploring other sign systems semioticians commonly refer to films television and radio programmes advertising posters and so on as texts and to reading television fiske and hartley  media such as television and film are regarded by some semioticians as being in some respects like languages the issue tends to revolve around whether film is closer to what we treat as reality in the everyday world of our own experience or whether it has more in common with a symbolic system like writing some refer to the grammar of media other than language for james monaco film has no grammar and he offers a useful critique of glib analogies between film techniques and the grammar of natural language ibid  there is a danger of trying to force all media into a linguistic framework with regard to photography though one might say the same for film and television victor burgin insists that there is no language of photography no single signifying system as opposed to technical apparatus upon which all photographs depend in the sense in which all texts in english depend upon the english language there is rather a heterogeneous complex of codes upon which photography may draw burgin b  we will shortly examine saussures model of the sign but before doing so it is important to understand something about the general framework within which he situated it saussure made what is now a famous distinction between langue language and parole speech langue refers to the system of rules and conventions which is independent of and preexists individual users parole refers to its use in particular instances applying the notion to semiotic systems in general rather than simply to language the distinction is one between between code and message structure and event or system and usage in specific texts or contexts according to the saussurean distinction in a semiotic system such as cinema any specific film is the speech of that underlying system of cinema language langholz leymore   saussure focused on langue rather than parole to the traditional saussurean semiotician what matters most are the underlying structures and rules of a semiotic system as a whole rather than specific performances or practices which are merely instances of its use saussures approach was to study the system synchronically if it were frozen in time like a photograph  rather than diachronically  in terms of its evolution over time like a film structuralist cultural theorists subsequently adopted this saussurean priority focusing on the functions of social and cultural phenomena within semiotic systems theorists differ over whether the system precedes and determines usage structural determinism or whether usage precedes and determines the system social determinism although note that most structuralists argue that the system constrains rather than completely determines usage the structuralist dichotomy between usage and system has been criticized for its rigidity splitting process from product subject from structure coward  ellis    the prioritization of structure over usage fails to account for changes in structure marxist theorists have been particularly critical of this in the late s valentin volosinov  and mikhail bakhtin  criticized saussures synchronic approach and his emphasis on internal relations within the system of language voloshinov  morris  volosinov reversed the saussurean priority of langue over parole the sign is part of organized social intercourse and cannot exist as such outside it reverting to a mere physical artifact voloshinov   the meaning of a sign is not in its relationship to other signs within the language system but rather in the social context of its use saussure was criticized for ignoring historicity ibid  the prague school linguists roman jakobson and yuri tynyanov declared in  that pure synchronism now proves to be an illusion adding that every synchronic system has its past and its future as inseparable structural elements of the system cited in voloshinov   writing in  volosinov observed that there is no real moment in time when a synchronic system of language could be constructed a synchronic system may be said to exist only from the point of view of the subjective consciousness of an individual speaker belonging to some particular language group at some particular moment of historical time voloshinov   whilst the french structuralist claude lévistrauss applied a synchronic approach in the domain of anthropology most contemporary semioticians have sought to reprioritize historicity and social context language is seldom treated as a static closed and stable system which is inherited from preceding generations but as constantly changing the sign as voloshinov put it is an arena of the class struggle ibid  seeking to establish a wholeheartedly social semiotics robert hodge and gunther kress declare that the social dimensions of semiotic systems are so intrinsic to their nature and function that the systems cannot be studied in isolation hodge  kress   whilst saussure may be hailed as a founder of semiotics semiotics has become increasingly less saussurean teresa de lauretis describes the movement away from structuralist semiotics which began in the s in the last decade or so semiotics has undergone a shift of its theoretical gears a shift away from the classification of sign systems  their basic units their levels of structural organization  and towards the exploration of the modes of production of signs and meanings the ways in which systems and codes are used transformed or transgressed in social practice while formerly the emphasis was on studying sign systems language literature cinema architecture music etc conceived of as mechanisms that generate messages what is now being examined is the work performed through them it is this work or activity which constitutes andor transforms the codes at the same time as it constitutes and transforms the individuals using the codes performing the work the individuals who are therefore the subjects of semiosis semiosis a term borrowed from charles sanders peirce is expanded by eco to designate the process by which a culture produces signs andor attributes meaning to signs although for eco meaning production or semiosis is a social activity he allows that subjective factors are involved in each individual act of semiosis the notion then might be pertinent to the two main emphases of current or poststructuralist semiotic theory one is a semiotics focused on the subjective aspects of signification and strongly influenced by lacanian psychoanalysis where meaning is construed as a subjecteffect the subject being an effect of the signifier the other is a semiotics concerned to stress the social aspect of signification its practical aesthetic or ideological use in interpersonal communication there meaning is construed as semantic value produced through culturally shared codes de lauretis   this text outlines some of the key concepts in semiotics together with relevant critiques beginning with the most fundamental concept of the sign itself i hope it will prove to be a useful companion to the reader in finding their own path through the subject but before launching on an exploration of this intriguing but demanding subject let us consider why we should bother why should we study semiotics this is a pressing question in part because the writings of semioticians have a reputation for being dense with jargon justin lewis notes that its advocates have written in a style that ranges from the obscure to the incomprehensible lewis   another critic wittily remarked that semiotics tells us things we already know in a language we will never understand paddy whannel cited in seiter   the semiotic establishment is a very exclusive club but as david sless remarks semiotics is far too important an enterprise to be left to semioticians sless   semiotics is important because it can help us not to take reality for granted as something having a purely objective existence which is independent of human interpretation it teaches us that reality is a system of signs studying semiotics can assist us to become more aware of reality as a construction and of the roles played by ourselves and others in constructing it it can help us to realize that information or meaning is not contained in the world or in books computers or audiovisual media meaning is not transmitted to us  we actively create it according to a complex interplay of codes or conventions of which we are normally unaware becoming aware of such codes is both inherently fascinating and intellectually empowering we learn from semiotics that we live in a world of signs and we have no way of understanding anything except through signs and the codes into which they are organized through the study of semiotics we become aware that these signs and codes are normally transparent and disguise our task in reading them living in a world of increasingly visual signs we need to learn that even the most realistic signs are not what they appear to be by making more explicit the codes by which signs are interpreted we may perform the valuable semiotic function of denaturalizing signs in defining realities signs serve ideological functions deconstructing and contesting the realities of signs can reveal whose realities are privileged and whose are suppressed the study of signs is the study of the construction and maintenance of reality to decline such a study is to leave to others the control of the world of meanings

suggested reading references index semiotics for beginners signs semiotics for beginners daniel chandler signs we seem as a species to be driven by a desire to make meanings above all we are surely homo significans  meaningmakers distinctively we make meanings through our creation and interpretation of signs indeed according to peirce we think only in signs peirce   signs take the form of words images sounds odours flavours acts or objects but such things have no intrinsic meaning and become signs only when we invest them with meaning nothing is a sign unless it is interpreted as a sign declares peirce peirce   anything can be a sign as long as someone interprets it as signifying something  referring to or standing for something other than itself we interpret things as signs largely unconsciously by relating them to familiar systems of conventions it is this meaningful use of signs which is at the heart of the concerns of semiotics the two dominant models of what constitutes a sign are those of the linguist ferdinand de saussure and the philosopher charles sanders peirce these will be discussed in turn saussure offered a dyadic or twopart model of the sign he defined a sign as being composed of a signifier signifiant  the form which the sign takes and the signified signifié  the concept it represents the sign is the whole that results from the association of the signifier with the signified saussure   saussure   the relationship between the signifier and the signified is referred to as signification and this is represented in the saussurean diagram by the arrows the horizontal line marking the two elements of the sign is referred to as the bar if we take a linguistic example the word open when it is invested with meaning by someone who encounters it on a shop doorway is a sign consisting of a signifier the word open a signified concept that the shop is open for business a sign must have both a signifier and a signified you cannot have a totally meaningless signifier or a completely formless signified saussure   saussure   a sign is a recognizable combination of a signifier with a particular signified the same signifier the word open could stand for a different signified and thus be a different sign if it were on a pushbutton inside a lift push to open door similarly many signifiers could stand for the concept open for instance on top of a packing carton a small outline of a box with an open flap for open this end  again with each unique pairing constituting a different sign nowadays whilst the basic saussurean model is commonly adopted it tends to be a more materialistic model than that of saussure himself the signifier is now commonly interpreted as the material or physical form of the sign  it is something which can be seen heard touched smelt or tasted for saussure both the signifier and the signified were purely psychological saussure     saussure     both were form rather than substance a linguistic sign is not a link between a thing and a name but between a concept and a sound pattern the sound pattern is not actually a sound for a sound is something physical a sound pattern is the hearers psychological impression of a sound as given to him by the evidence of his senses this sound pattern may be called a material element only in that it is the representation of our sensory impressions the sound pattern may thus be distinguished from the other element associated with it in a linguistic sign this other element is generally of a more abstract kind the concept saussure   saussure   saussure was focusing on the linguistic sign such as a word and he phonocentrically privileged the spoken word referring specifically to the image acoustique soundimage or sound pattern seeing writing as a separate secondary dependent but comparable sign system saussure     saussure      within the separate system of written signs a signifier such as the written letter t signified a sound in the primary sign system of language and thus a written word would also signify a sound rather than a concept thus for saussure writing relates to speech as signifier to signified most subsequent theorists who have adopted saussures model are content to refer to the form of linguistic signs as either spoken or written we will return later to the issue of the postsaussurean rematerialization of the sign as for the signified most commentators who adopt saussures model still treat this as a mental construct although they often note that it may nevertheless refer indirectly to things in the world saussures original model of the sign brackets the referent excluding reference to objects existing in the world his signified is not to be identified directly with a referent but is a concept in the mind  not a thing but the notion of a thing some people may wonder why saussures model of the sign refers only to a concept and not to a thing an observation from the philosopher susanne langer who was not referring to saussures theories may be useful here note that like most contemporary commentators langer uses the term symbol to refer to the linguistic sign a term which saussure himself avoided symbols are not proxy for their objects but are vehicles for the conception of objects in talking about things we have conceptions of them not the things themselves and it is the conceptions not the things that symbols directly mean behaviour towards conceptions is what words normally evoke this is the typical process of thinking she adds that if i say napoleon you do not bow to the conqueror of europe as though i had introduced him but merely think of him langer   thus for saussure the linguistic sign is wholly immaterial  although he disliked referring to it as abstract saussure   saussure   the immateriality of the saussurean sign is a feature which tends to be neglected in many popular commentaries if the notion seems strange we need to remind ourselves that words have no value in themselves  that is their value saussure noted that it is not the metal in a coin that fixes its value saussure   saussure   several reasons could be offered for this for instance if linguistic signs drew attention to their materiality this would hinder their communicative transparency langer   furthermore being immaterial language is an extraordinarily economical medium and words are always readytohand nevertheless a principled argument can be made for the revaluation of the materiality of the sign as we shall see in due course saussure noted that his choice of the terms signifier and signified helped to indicate the distinction which separates each from the other saussure   saussure   despite this and the horizontal bar in his diagram of the sign saussure stressed that sound and thought or the signifier and the signified were as inseparable as the two sides of a piece of paper saussure   saussure   they were intimately linked in the mind by an associative link  each triggers the other saussure   saussure   saussure presented these elements as wholly interdependent neither preexisting the other silverman   within the context of spoken language a sign could not consist of sound without sense or of sense without sound he used the two arrows in the diagram to suggest their interaction the bar and the opposition nevertheless suggests that the signifier and the signified can be distinguished for analytical purposes poststructuralist theorists criticize the clear distinction which the saussurean bar seems to suggest between the signifier and the signified they seek to blur or erase it in order to reconfigure the sign or structural relations some theorists have argued that the signifier is always separated from the signified and has a real autonomy lechte   a point to which we will return in discussing the arbitrariness of the sign commonsense tends to insist that the signified takes precedence over and preexists the signifier look after the sense quipped lewis carroll and the sounds will take care of themselves alices adventures in wonderland chapter  however in dramatic contrast postsaussurean theorists have seen the model as implicitly granting primacy to the signifier thus reversing the commonsensical position louis hjelmslev used the terms expression and content to refer to the signifier and signified respectively hjelmslev  ff the distinction between signifier and signified has sometimes been equated to the familiar dualism of form and content within such a framework the signifier is seen as the form of the sign and the signified as the content however the metaphor of form as a container is problematic tending to support the equation of content with meaning implying that meaning can be extracted without an active process of interpretation and that form is not in itself meaningful chandler   saussure argued that signs only make sense as part of a formal generalized and abstract system his conception of meaning was purely structural and relational rather than referential primacy is given to relationships rather than to things the meaning of signs was seen as lying in their systematic relation to each other rather than deriving from any inherent features of signifiers or any reference to material things saussure did not define signs in terms of some essential or intrinsic nature for saussure signs refer primarily to each other within the language system everything depends on relations saussure   saussure   no sign makes sense on its own but only in relation to other signs both signifier and signified are purely relational entities saussure   saussure   this notion can be hard to understand since we may feel that an individual word such as tree does have some meaning for us but its meaning depends on its context in relation to the other words with which it is used together with the vertical alignment of signifier and signified within each individual sign suggesting two structural levels the emphasis on the relationship between signs defines what are in effect two planes  that of the signifier and the signifier later louis hjelmslev referred to the planes of expression and content hjelmslev   saussure himself referred to sound and thought as two distinct but correlated planes we can envisage the language as a series of adjoining subdivisions simultaneously imprinted both on the plane of vague amorphous thought a and on the equally featureless plane of sound b saussure   saussure   the arbitrary division of the two continua into signs is suggested by the dotted lines whilst the wavy rather than parallel edges of the two amorphous masses suggest the lack of any natural fit between them the gulf and lack of fit between the two planes highlights their relative autonomy whilst saussure is careful not to refer directly to reality fredric jameson reads into this feature of saussures system that it is not so much the individual word or sentence that stands for or reflects the individual object or event in the real world but rather that the entire system of signs the entire field of the langue lies parallel to reality itself that it is the totality of systematic language in other words which is analogous to whatever organized structures exist in the world of reality and that our understanding proceeds from one whole or gestalt to the other rather than on a onetoone basis jameson   what saussure refers to as the value of a sign depends on its relations with other signs within the system  a sign has no absolute value independent of this context saussure   saussure   saussure uses an analogy with the game of chess noting that the value of each piece depends on its position on the chessboard saussure   saussure   the sign is more than the sum of its parts whilst signification  what is signified  clearly depends on the relationship between the two parts of the sign the value of a sign is determined by the relationships between the sign and other signs within the system as a whole saussure   saussure   the notion of value shows us that it is a great mistake to consider a sign as nothing more than the combination of a certain sound and a certain concept to think of a sign as nothing more would be to isolate it from the system to which it belongs it would be to suppose that a start could be made with individual signs and a system constructed by putting them together on the contrary the system as a united whole is the starting point from which it becomes possible by a process of analysis to identify its constituent elements saussure   saussure   as an example of the distinction between signification and value saussure notes that the french word mouton may have the same meaning as the english word sheep but it does not have the same value there are various reasons for this but in particular the fact that the english word for the meat of this animal as prepared and served for a meal is not sheep but mutton the difference in value between sheep and mouton hinges on the fact that in english there is also another word mutton for the meat whereas mouton in french covers both saussure   saussure   saussures relational conception of meaning was specifically differential he emphasized the differences between signs language for him was a system of functional differences and oppositions in a language as in every other semiological system what distinguishes a sign is what constitutes it saussure   saussure   as john sturrock points out a oneterm language is an impossibility because its single term could be applied to everything and differentiate nothing it requires at least one other term to give it definition sturrock   advertising furnishes a good example of this notion since what matters in positioning a product is not the relationship of advertising signifiers to realworld referents but the differentiation of each sign from the others to which it is related saussures concept of the relational identity of signs is at the heart of structuralist theory structuralist analysis focuses on the structural relations which are functional in the signifying system at a particular moment in history relations are important for what they can explain meaningful contrasts and permitted or forbidden combinations culler   saussure emphasized in particular negative oppositional differences between signs and the key relationships in structuralist analysis are binary oppositions such as natureculture lifedeath saussure argued that concepts are defined not positively in terms of their content but negatively by contrast with other items in the same system what characterizes each most exactly is being whatever the others are not saussure   saussure   my emphasis this notion may initially seem mystifying if not perverse but the concept of negative differentiation becomes clearer if we consider how we might teach someone who did not share our language what we mean by the term red we would be unlikely to make our point by simply showing them a range of different objects which all happened to be red  we would be probably do better to single out a red object from a sets of objects which were identical in all respects except colour although saussure focuses on speech he also noted that in writing the values of the letter are purely negative and differential  all we need to be able to do is to distinguish one letter from another saussure   saussure   as for his emphasis on negative differences saussure remarks that although both the signified and the signifier are purely differential and negative when considered separately the sign in which they are combined is a positive term he adds that the moment we compare one sign with another as positive combinations the term difference should be dropped two signs are not different from each other but only distinct they are simply in opposition to each other the entire mechanism of language is based on oppositions of this kind and upon the phonic and conceptual differences they involve saussure   saussure   although the signifier is treated by its users as standing for the signified saussurean semioticians emphasize that there is no necessary intrinsic direct or inevitable relationship between the signifier and the signified saussure stressed the arbitrariness of the sign saussure    saussure     more specifically the arbitrariness of the link between the signifier and the signified saussure   saussure   he was focusing on linguistic signs seeing language as the most important sign system for saussure the arbitrary nature of the sign was the first principle of language saussure   saussure    arbitrariness was identified later by charles hockett as a key design feature of language hockett  hockett  hockett  the feature of arbitrariness may indeed help to account for the extraordinary versatility of language lyons   in the context of natural language saussure stressed that there is no inherent essential transparent selfevident or natural connection between the signifier and the signified  between the sound or shape of a word and the concept to which it refers saussure       saussure       note that saussure himself avoids directly relating the principle of arbitrariness to the relationship between language and an external world but that subsequent commentators often do and indeed lurking behind the purely conceptual signified one can often detect saussures allusion to realworld referents coward  ellis   in language at least the form of the signifier is not determined by what it signifies there is nothing treeish about the word tree languages differ of course in how they refer to the same referent no specific signifier is naturally more suited to a signified than any other signifier in principle any signifier could represent any signified saussure observed that there is nothing at all to prevent the association of any idea whatsoever with any sequence of sounds whatsoever saussure   saussure   the process which selects one particular soundsequence to correspond to one particular idea is completely arbitrary saussure   saussure   this principle of the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign was not an original conception aristotle had noted that there can be no natural connection between the sound of any language and the things signified cited in richards   in platos cratylus hermogenes urged socrates to accept that whatever name you give to a thing is its right name and if you give up that name and change it for another the later name is no less correct than the earlier just as we change the name of our servants for i think no name belongs to a particular thing by nature cited in harris   that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet as shakespeare put it whilst the notion of the arbitrariness of language was not new but the emphasis which saussure gave it can be seen as an original contribution particularly in the context of a theory which bracketed the referent note that although saussure prioritized speech he also stressed that the signs used in writing are arbitrary the letter t for instance has no connection with the sound it denotes saussure   saussure   the arbitrariness principle can be applied not only to the sign but to the whole signsystem the fundamental arbitrariness of language is apparent from the observation that each language involves different distinctions between one signifier and another eg tree and free and between one signified and another eg tree and bush the signified is clearly arbitrary if reality is perceived as a seamless continuum which is how saussure sees the initially undifferentiated realms of both thought and sound where for example does a corner end commonsense suggests that the existence of things in the world preceded our apparently simple application of labels to them a nomenclaturist notion which saussure rejected and to which we will return in due course saussure noted that if words had the job of representing concepts fixed in advance one would be able to find exact equivalents for them as between one language and another but this is not the case saussure   saussure   reality is divided up into arbitrary categories by every language and the conceptual world with which each of us is familiar could have been divided up very differently indeed no two languages categorize reality in the same way as john passmore puts it languages differ by differentiating differently cited in sturrock   linguistic categories are not simply a consequence of some predefined structure in the world there are no natural concepts or categories which are simply reflected in language language plays a crucial role in constructing reality if one accepts the arbitrariness of the relationship between signifier and signified then one may argue counterintuitively that the signified is determined by the signifier rather than vice versa indeed the french psychoanalyst jacques lacan in adapting saussurean theories sought to highlight the primacy of the signifier in the psyche by rewriting saussures model of the sign in the form of a quasialgebraic sign in which a capital s representing the signifier is placed over a lower case and italicized s representing the signified these two signifiers being separated by a horizontal bar lacan   this suited lacans purpose of emphasizing how the signified inevitably slips beneath the signifier resisting our attempts to delimit it lacan poetically refers to saussures illustration of the planes of sound and thought as an image resembling the wavy lines of the upper and lower waters in miniatures from manuscripts of genesis a double flux marked by streaks of rain suggesting that this can be seen as illustrating the incessant sliding of the signified under the signifier  although he argues that one should regard the dotted vertical lines not as segments of correspondence but as anchoring points points de capiton  literally the buttons which anchor upholstery to furniture however he notes that this model is too linear since there is in effect no signifying chain that does not have as if attached to the punctuation of each of its units a whole articulation of relevant contexts suspended vertically as it were from that point ibid  in the spirit of the lacanian critique of saussures model subsequent theorists have emphasized the temporary nature of the bond between signifier and signified stressing that the fixing of the chain of signifiers is socially situated coward  ellis      note that whilst the intent of lacan in placing the signifier over the signified is clear enough his representational strategy seems a little curious since in the modelling of society orthodox marxists routinely represent the fundamental driving force of the technoeconomic base as logically below the ideological superstructure the arbitrariness of the sign is a radical concept because it proposes the autonomy of language in relation to reality the saussurean model with its emphasis on internal structures within a sign system can be seen as supporting the notion that language does not reflect reality but rather constructs it we can use language to say what isnt in the world as well as what is and since we come to know the world through whatever language we have been born into the midst of it is legitimate to argue that our language determines reality rather than reality our language sturrock   in their book the meaning of meaning ogden and richards criticized saussure for neglecting entirely the things for which signs stand ogden  richards   later critics have lamented his models detachment from social context gardiner   robert stam argues that by bracketing the referent the saussurean model severs text from history stam   we will return to this theme of the relationship between language and reality in our discussion of modality and representation the arbitrary aspect of signs does help to account for the scope for their interpretation and the importance of context there is no onetoone link between signifier and signified signs have multiple rather than single meanings within a single language one signifier may refer to many signifieds eg puns and one signified may be referred to by many signifiers eg synonyms some commentators are critical of the stance that the relationship of the signifier to the signified even in language is always completely arbitrary eg lewis   onomatopoeic words are often mentioned in this context though some semioticians retort that this hardly accounts for the variability between different languages in their words for the same sounds notably the sounds made by familiar animals saussure   saussure   saussure declares that the entire linguistic system is founded upon the irrational principle that the sign is arbitrary this provocative declaration is followed immediately by the acknowledgement that applied without restriction this principle would lead to utter chaos saussure   saussure   if linguistic signs were to be totally arbitrary in every way language would not be a system and its communicative function would be destroyed he concedes that there exists no language in which nothing at all is motivated ibid saussure admits that a language is not completely arbitrary for the system has a certain rationality saussure   saussure   the principle of arbitrariness does not mean that the form of a word is accidental or random of course whilst the sign is not determined extralinguistically it is subject to intralinguistic determination for instance signifiers must constitute wellformed combinations of sounds which conform with existing patterns within the language in question furthermore we can recognize that a compound noun such as screwdriver is not wholly arbitrary since it is a meaningful combination of two existing signs saussure introduces a distinction between degrees of arbitrariness the fundamental principle of the arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign does not prevent us from distinguishing in any language between what is intrinsically arbitrary  that is unmotivated  and what is only relatively arbitrary not all signs are absolutely arbitrary in some cases there are factors which allow us to recognize different degrees of arbitrariness although never to discard the notion entirely the sign may be motivated to a certain extent saussure   saussure   original emphasis see also following pages here then saussure modifies his stance somewhat and refers to signs as being relatively arbitrary some subsequent theorists echoing althusserian marxist terminology refer to the relationship between the signifier and the signified in terms of relative autonomy tagg   lechte   the relative conventionality of relationships between signified and signifier is a point to which i return below it should be noted that whilst the relationships between signifiers and their signifieds are ontologically arbitrary philosophically it would not make any difference to the status of these entities in the order of things if what we call black had always been called white and vice versa this is not to suggest that signifying systems are socially or historically arbitrary natural languages are not of course arbitrarily established unlike historical inventions such as morse code nor does the arbitrary nature of the sign make it socially neutral or materially transparent  for example in western culture white has come to be a privileged signifier dyer  even in the case of the arbitrary colours of traffic lights the original choice of red for stop was not entirely arbitrary since it already carried relevant associations with danger as lévistrauss noted the sign is arbitrary a priori but ceases to be arbitrary a posteriori  after the sign has come into historical existence it cannot be arbitrarily changed lévistrauss   as part of its social use within a code a term which became fundamental amongst postsaussurean semioticians every sign acquires a history and connotations of its own which are familiar to members of the signusers culture saussure remarked that although the signifier may seem to be freely chosen from the point of view of the linguistic community it is imposed rather than freely chosen because a language is always an inheritance from the past which its users have no choice but to accept saussure   saussure   indeed it is because the linguistic sign is arbitrary that it knows no other law than that of tradition and it is because it is founded upon tradition that it can be arbitrary saussure   saussure   the arbitrariness principle does not of course mean that an individual can arbitrarily choose any signifier for a given signified the relation between a signifier and its signified is not a matter of individual choice if it were then communication would become impossible the individual has no power to alter a sign in any respect once it has become established in the linguistic community saussure   saussure   from the pointofview of individual languageusers language is a given  we dont create the system for ourselves saussure refers to the language system as a nonnegotiable contract into which one is born saussure   saussure    although he later problematizes the term ibid  the ontological arbitrariness which it involves becomes invisible to us as we learn to accept it as natural the saussurean legacy of the arbitrariness of signs leads semioticians to stress that the relationship between the signifier and the signified is conventional  dependent on social and cultural conventions this is particularly clear in the case of the linguistic signs with which saussure was concerned a word means what it does to us only because we collectively agree to let it do so saussure felt that the main concern of semiotics should be the whole group of systems grounded in the arbitrariness of the sign he argued that signs which are entirely arbitrary convey better than others the ideal semiological process that is why the most complex and the most widespread of all systems of expression which is the one we find in human languages is also the most characteristic of all in this sense linguistics serves as a model for the whole of semiology even though languages represent only one type of semiological system saussure   saussure   he did not in fact offer many examples of sign systems other than spoken language and writing mentioning only the deafanddumb alphabet social customs etiquette religious and other symbolic rites legal procedures military signals and nautical flags saussure      saussure      saussure added that any means of expression accepted in a society rests in principle upon a collective habit or on convention  which comes to the same thing saussure   saussure   however whilst purely conventional signs such as words are quite independent of their referents other less conventional forms of signs are often somewhat less independent of them nevertheless since the arbitary nature of linguistic signs is clear those who have adopted the saussurean model have tended to avoid the familiar mistake of assuming that signs which appear natural to those who use them have an intrinsic meaning and require no explanation culler   at around the same time as saussure was formulating his model of the sign of semiology and of a structuralist methodology across the atlantic independent work was also in progress as the pragmatist philosopher and logician charles sanders peirce formulated his own model of the sign of semiotic and of the taxonomies of signs in contrast to saussures model of the sign in the form of a selfcontained dyad peirce offered a triadic model the representamen the form which the sign takes not necessarily material an interpretant not an interpreter but rather the sense made of the sign an object to which the sign refers a sign in the form of a representamen is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity it addresses somebody that is creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign or perhaps a more developed sign that sign which it creates i call the interpretant of the first sign the sign stands for something its object it stands for that object not in all respects but in reference to a sort of idea which i have sometimes called the ground of the representamen peirce   the interaction between the representamen the object and the interpretant is referred to by peirce as semiosis ibid  within peirces model of the sign the traffic light sign for stop would consist of a red light facing traffic at an intersection the representamen vehicles halting the object and the idea that a red light indicates that vehicles must stop the interpretant peirces model of the sign includes an object or referent  which does not of course feature directly in saussures model the representamen is similar in meaning to saussures signifier whilst the interpretant is similar in meaning to the signified silverman   however the interpretant has a quality unlike that of the signified it is itself a sign in the mind of the interpreter peirce noted that a sign addresses somebody that is creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign or perhaps a more developed sign the sign which it creates i call the interpretant of the first sign peirce   umberto eco uses the phrase unlimited semiosis to refer to the way in which this could lead as peirce was well aware to a series of successive interpretants potentially ad infinitum ibid   elsewhere peirce added that the meaning of a representation can be nothing but a representation ibid  any initial interpretation can be reinterpreted that a signified can itself play the role of a signifier is familiar to anyone who uses a dictionary and finds themselves going beyond the original definition to look up yet another word which it employs this concept can be seen as going beyond saussures emphasis on the value of a sign lying in its relation to other signs and it was later to be developed more radically by poststructuralist theorists another concept which is alluded to within peirces model which has been taken up by later theorists but which was explicitly excluded from saussures model is the notion of dialogical thought it stems in part from peirces emphasis on semiosis as a process which is in distinct contrast to saussures synchronic emphasis on structure peirce    peirce argued that all thinking is dialogic in form your self of one instant appeals to your deeper self for his assent peirce   this notion resurfaced in a more developed form in the s in the theories of mikhail bakhtin bakhtin  one important aspect of this is its characterization even of internal reflection as fundamentally social peirce clearly fascinated by tripartite structures made a phenomenological distinction between the sign itself or the representamen as an instance of firstness its object as an instance of secondness and the interpretant as an instance of thirdness such unfamiliar terms are relatively modest examples of peircean coinages and the complexity of his terminology and style has been a factor in limiting the influence of a distinctively peircean semiotics variants of peirces triad are often presented as the semiotic triangle as if there were only one version here is a version which is quite often encountered and which changes only the unfamiliar peircean terms nöth   sign vehicle the form of the sign sense the sense made of the sign referent what the sign stands for one fairly wellknown semiotic triangle is that of ogden and richards in which the terms used are a symbol b thought or reference and c referent ogden  richards   the broken line at the base of the triangle is intended to indicate that there is not necessarily any observable or direct relationship between the sign vehicle and the referent unlike saussures abstract signified which is analogous to term b rather than to c the referent is an object this need not exclude the reference of signs to abstract concepts and fictional entities as well as to physical things but peirces model allocates a place for an objective reality which saussures model did not directly feature though peirce was not a naive realist and argued that all experience is mediated by signs note however that peirce emphasized that the dependence of the mode of existence of the thing represented upon the mode of this or that representation of it is contrary to the nature of reality peirce   the inclusion of a referent in peirces model does not automatically make it a better model of the sign than that of saussure indeed as john lyons notes there is considerable disagreement about the details of the triadic analysis even among those who accept that all three components a b and c must be taken into account should a be defined as a physical or a mental entity what is the psychological or ontological status of b is c something that is referred to on a particular occasion or is it the totality of things that might be referred to by uttering the sign or yet a third possibility is it some typical or ideal representative of this class lyons   the notion of the importance of sensemaking which requires an interpreter  though peirce doesnt feature that term in his triad has had a particular appeal for communication and media theorists who stress the importance of the active process of interpretation and thus reject the equation of content and meaning many of these theorists allude to semiotic triangles in which the interpreter or user of the sign features explicitly in place of sense or interpretant this highlights the process of semiosis which is very much a peircean concept the meaning of a sign is not contained within it but arises in its interpretation whether a dyadic or triadic model is adopted the role of the interpreter must be accounted for  either within the formal model of the sign or as an essential part of the process of semiosis david sless declares that statements about users signs or referents can never be made in isolation from each other a statement about one always contains implications about the other two sless   paul thibault argues that the interpreter features implicitly even within saussures apparently dyadic model thibault   note that semioticians make a distinction between a sign and a sign vehicle the latter being a signifier to saussureans and a representamen to peirceans the sign is more than just a sign vehicle the term sign is often used loosely so that this distinction is not always preserved in the saussurean framework some references to the sign should be to the signifier and similarly peirce himself frequently mentions the sign when strictly speaking he is referring to the representamen it is easy to be found guilty of such a slippage perhaps because we are so used to looking beyond the form which the sign happens to take however to reiterate the signifier or representamen is the form in which the sign appears such as the spoken or written form of a word whereas the sign is the whole meaningful ensemble whereas saussure emphasized the arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign most semioticians stress that signs differ in how arbitraryconventional or by contrast transparent they are symbolism reflects only one form of relationship between signifiers and their signifieds whilst saussure did not offer a typology of signs charles peirce was a compulsive taxonomist and he offered several logical typologies peirce    however his divisions and subdivisions of signs are extraordinarily elaborate indeed he offered the theoretical projection that there could be  types of signs peirce himself noted wryly that this calculation threatens a multitude of classes too great to be conveniently carried in ones head adding that we shall i think do well to postpone preparation for further divisions until there be a prospect of such a thing being wanted peirce   however even his more modest proposals are daunting susanne langer commented that there is but cold comfort in his assurance that his original  types can really be boiled down to a mere sixtysix langer   unfortunately the complexity of such typologies rendered them nearly useless as working models for others in the field sturrock   however one of peirces basic classifications first outlined in  has been very widely referred to in subsequent semiotic studies peirce   he regarded it as the most fundamental division of signs ibid  it is less useful as a classification of distinct types of signs than of differing modes of relationship between sign vehicles and their referents hawkes   note that in the subsequent account i have continued to employ the saussurean terms signifier and signified even though peirce referred to the relation between the sign sic and the object since the peircean distinctions are most commonly employed within a broadly saussurean framework such incorporation tends to emphasize albeit indirectly the referential potential of the signified within the saussurean model here then are the three modes together with some brief definitions of my own and some illustrative examples symbolsymbolic a mode in which the signifier does not resemble the signified but which is fundamentally arbitrary or purely conventional  so that the relationship must be learnt eg language in general plus specific languages alphabetical letters punctuation marks words phrases and sentences numbers morse code traffic lights national flags iconiconic a mode in which the signifier is perceived as resembling or imitating the signified recognizably looking sounding feeling tasting or smelling like it  being similar in possessing some of its qualities eg a portrait a cartoon a scalemodel onomatopoeia metaphors realistic sounds in programme music sound effects in radio drama a dubbed film soundtrack imitative gestures indexindexical a mode in which the signifier is not arbitrary but is directly connected in some way physically or causally to the signified  this link can be observed or inferred eg natural signs smoke thunder footprints echoes nonsynthetic odours and flavours medical symptoms pain a rash pulserate measuring instruments weathercock thermometer clock spiritlevel signals a knock on a door a phone ringing pointers a pointing index finger a directional signpost recordings a photograph a film video or television shot an audiorecorded voice personal trademarks handwriting catchphrase and indexical words that this here there the three forms are listed here in decreasing order of conventionality symbolic signs such as language are at least highly conventional iconic signs always involve some degree of conventionality indexical signs direct the attention to their objects by blind compulsion peirce   indexical and iconic signifiers can be seen as more constrained by referential signifieds whereas in the more conventional symbolic signs the signified can be seen as being defined to a greater extent by the signifier within each form signs also vary in their degree of conventionality other criteria might be applied to rank the three forms differently for instance hodge and kress suggest that indexicality is based on an act of judgement or inference whereas iconicity is closer to direct perception making the highest modality that of iconic signs note that the terms motivation from saussure and constraint are sometimes used to describe the extent to which the signified determines the signifier the more a signifier is constrained by the signified the more motivated the sign is iconic signs are highly motivated symbolic signs are unmotivated the less motivated the sign the more learning of an agreed convention is required nevertheless most semioticians emphasize the role of convention in relation to signs as we shall see even photographs and films are built on conventions which we must learn to read such conventions are an important social dimension of semiotics peirce and saussure used the term symbol differently from each other whilst nowadays most theorists would refer to language as a symbolic sign system saussure avoided referring to linguistic signs as symbols since the ordinary everyday use of this term refers to examples such as a pair of scales signifying justice and he insisted that such signs are never wholly arbitrary they are not empty configurations they show at least a vestige of natural connection between the signifier and the signified  a link which he later refers to as rational saussure    saussure    whilst saussure focused on the arbitrary nature of the linguistic sign a more obvious example of arbitrary symbolism is mathematics mathematics does not need to refer to an external world at all its signifieds are indisputably concepts and mathematics is a system of relations langer   for peirce a symbol is a sign which refers to the object that it denotes by virtue of a law usually an association of general ideas which operates to cause the symbol to be interpreted as referring to that object peirce   we interpret symbols according to a rule or a habitual connection ibid    the symbol is connected with its object by virtue of the idea of the symbolusing animal without which no such connection would exist ibid  it is constituted a sign merely or mainly by the fact that it is used and understood as such ibid  it would lose the character which renders it a sign if there were no interpretant ibid  a symbol is a conventional sign or one depending upon habit acquired or inborn ibid  all words sentences books and other conventional signs are symbols ibid  peirce thus characterizes linguistic signs in terms of their conventionality in a similar way to saussure in a rare direct reference to the arbitrariness of symbols which he then called tokens he noted that they are for the most part conventional or arbitrary ibid  a symbol is a sign whose special significance or fitness to represent just what it does represent lies in nothing but the very fact of there being a habit disposition or other effective general rule that it will be so interpreted take for example the word man these three letters are not in the least like a man nor is the sound with which they are associated ibid  he adds elsewhere that a symbol fulfills its function regardless of any similarity or analogy with its object and equally regardless of any factual connection therewith but solely because it will be interpreted as a sign ibid  original emphasis turning to icons peirce declared that an iconic sign represents its object mainly by its similarity peirce   a sign is an icon insofar as it is like that thing and used as a sign of it ibid  indeed he originally termed such modes likenesses eg ibid  he added that every picture however conventional its method is an icon ibid  icons have qualities which resemble those of the objects they represent and they excite analogous sensations in the mind ibid  see also  unlike the index the icon has no dynamical connection with the object it represents ibid just because a signifier resembles that which it depicts does not necessarily make it purely iconic the philosopher susanne langer argues that the picture is essentially a symbol not a duplicate of what it represents langer   pictures resemble what they represent only in some respects what we tend to recognize in an image are analogous relations of parts to a whole ibid  for peirce icons included every diagram even although there be no sensuous resemblance between it and its object but only an analogy between the relations of the parts of each peirce   many diagrams resemble their objects not at all in looks it is only in respect to the relations of their parts that their likeness consists ibid  even the most realistic image is not a replica or even a copy of what is depicted we rarely mistake a representation for what it represents semioticians generally maintain that there are no pure icons  there is always an element of cultural convention involved peirce stated that although any material image such as a painting may be perceived as looking like what it represents it is largely conventional in its mode of representation peirce   we say that the portrait of a person we have not seen is convincing so far as on the ground merely of what i see in it i am led to form an idea of the person it represents it is an icon but in fact it is not a pure icon because i am greatly influenced by knowing that it is an effect through the artist caused by the originals appearance besides i know that portraits have but the slightest resemblance to their originals except in certain conventional respects and after a conventional scale of values etc ibid  guy cook asks whether the iconic sign on the door of a public lavatory for men actually looks more like a man than like a woman for a sign to be truly iconic it would have to be transparent to someone who had never seen it before  and it seems unlikely that this is as much the case as is sometimes supposed we see the resemblance when we already know the meaning cook   thus even a realistic picture is symbolic as well as iconic iconic and indexical signs are more likely to be read as natural than symbolic signs when making the connection between signifier and signified has become habitual iconic signifiers can be highly evocative kent grayson observes because we can see the object in the sign we are often left with a sense that the icon has brought us closer to the truth than if we had instead seen an index or a symbol grayson   he adds that instead of drawing our attention to the gaps that always exist in representation iconic experiences encourage us subconsciously to fill in these gaps and then to believe that there were no gaps in the first place this is the paradox of representation it may deceive most when we think it works best ibid  the linguist john lyons notes that iconicity is always dependent upon properties of the medium in which the form is manifest lyons   he offers the example of the onomatopoeic english word cuckoo noting that it is only iconic in the phonic medium speech and not in the graphic medium writing whilst the phonic medium can represent characteristic sounds albeit in a relatively conventionalized way the graphic medium can represent characteristic shapes as in the case of egyptian hieroglyphs lyons   we will return shortly to the importance of the materiality of the sign indexicality is perhaps the most unfamiliar concept peirce offers various criteria for what constitutes an index an index indicates something for example a sundial or clock indicates the time of day peirce   he refers to a genuine relation between the sign and the object which does not depend purely on the interpreting mind ibid   the object is necessarily existent ibid  the index is connected to its object as a matter of fact ibid  there is a real connection ibid  there may be a direct physical connection ibid    an indexical sign is like a fragment torn away from the object ibid  unlike an icon the object of which may be fictional an index stands unequivocally for this or that existing thing ibid  whilst it necessarily has some quality in common with it the signifier is really affected by the signified there is an actual modification involved ibid  the relationship is not based on mere resemblance ibid indices have no significant resemblance to their objects ibid  similarity or analogy are not what define the index ibid  anything which focusses the attention is an index anything which startles us is an index ibid  see also  indexical signs direct the attention to their objects by blind compulsion ibid  see also   psychologically the action of indices depends upon association by contiguity and not upon association by resemblance or upon intellectual operations ibid whilst a photograph is also perceived as resembling that which it depicts peirce noted that a photograph is not only iconic but also indexical photographs especially instantaneous photographs are very instructive because we know that in certain respects they are exactly like the objects they represent but this resemblance is due to the photographs having been produced under such circumstances that they were physically forced to correspond point by point to nature in that aspect then they belong to the class of signs by physical connection the indexical class peirce   see also  so in this sense since the photographic image is an index of the effect of light on photographic emulsion all unedited photographic and filmic images are indexical although we should remember that conventional practices are always involved in composition focusing developing and so on such images do of course resemble what they depict and it has been suggested the real force of the photographic and filmic image lies in its iconic signification deacon et al   however whilst digital imaging techniques are increasingly eroding the indexicality of photographic images it is arguable that it is the indexicality still routinely attributed to the medium which is primarily responsible for interpreters treating them as objective records of reality peirce observed that a photograph owing to its optical connection with its object is evidence that that appearance corresponds to a reality peirce   in many contexts photographs are indeed regarded as evidence not least in legal contexts as for the moving image videocameras are of course widely used in evidence documentary film and location footage in television news programmes depend upon the indexical nature of the sign in such genres indexicality seems to warrant the status of the material as evidence photographic and filmic images may also be symbolic in an empirical study of television news davis and walton found that a relatively small proportion of the total number of shots is iconic or directly representative of the people places and events which are subjects of the news text a far greater proportion of shots has an oblique relationship to the text they stand for the subject matter indexically or symbolically davis  walton b  it is easy to slip into referring to peirces three forms as types of signs but they are not necessarily mutually exclusive a sign can be an icon a symbol and an index or any combination peirce was fully aware of this for instance he insisted that it would be difficult if not impossible to instance an absolutely pure index or to find any sign absolutely devoid of the indexical quality peirce   a map is indexical in pointing to the locations of things iconic in its representation of the directional relations and distances between landmarks and symbolic in using conventional symbols the significance of which must be learnt the film theorist peter wollen argues that the great merit of peirces analysis of signs is that he did not see the different aspects as mutually exclusive unlike saussure he did not show any particular prejudice in favour of one or the other indeed he wanted a logic and a rhetoric which would be based on all three aspects wollen   film and television use all three forms icon sound and image symbol speech and writing and index as the effect of what is filmed at first sight iconic signs seem the dominant form but some filmic signs are fairly arbitrary such as dissolves which signify that a scene from someones memory is to follow hawkes notes following jakobson that the three modes coexist in the form of a hierarchy in which one of them will inevitably have dominance over the other two with dominance determined by context hawkes   whether a sign is symbolic iconic or indexical depends primarily on the way in which the sign is used so textbook examples chosen to illustrate the various modes can be misleading the same signifier may be used iconically in one context and symbolically in another a photograph of a woman may stand for some broad category such as women or may more specifically represent only the particular woman who is depicted signs cannot be classified in terms of the three modes without reference to the purposes of their users within particular contexts a sign may consequently be treated as symbolic by one person as iconic by another and as indexical by a third as kent grayson puts it when we speak of an icon an index or a symbol we are not referring to objective qualities of the sign itself but to a viewers experience of the sign grayson   signs may also shift in mode over time as jonathan culler notes in one sense a rollsroyce is an index of wealth in that one must be wealthy in order to purchase one but it has been made a conventional sign of wealth by social usage culler   despite his emphasis on studying the languagestate synchronically as if it were frozen at one moment in time rather than diachronically studying its evolution saussure was well aware that the relationship between the signified and the signifier in language was subject to change over time saussure  ff saussure  ff however this was not the focus of his concern critics of structuralist approaches emphasize that the relation between signifier and signified is subject to dynamic change rosalind coward and john ellis argue that any fixing of the chain of signifiers  is both temporary and socially determined coward  ellis     in terms of peirces three modes a historical shift from one mode to another tends to occur although peirce made far more allowance for nonlinguistic signs than did saussure like saussure he too granted greater status to symbolic signs they are the only general signs and generality is essential to reasoning peirce   see also    saussures emphasis on the importance of the principle of arbitrariness reflects his prioritizing of symbolic signs whilst peirce referred to homo sapiens as the symbolusing animal peirce   the idea of the evolution of signsystems towards the symbolic mode is consistent with such a perspective peirce speculates whether there be a life in signs so that  the requisite vehicle being present  they will go through a certain order of development interestingly he does not present this as necessarily a matter of progress towards the ideal of symbolic form since he allows for the theoretical possibility that the same round of changes of form is described over and over again ibid  whilst granting such a possibility he nevertheless notes that a regular progression may be remarked in the three orders of signs icon index symbol ibid  peirce posits iconicity as the original default mode of signification declaring the icon to be an originalian sign ibid  defining this as the most primitive simple and original of the categories ibid  compared to the genuine sign or symbol an index is degenerate in the lesser degree whilst an icon is degenerate in the greater degree peirce noted that signs were originally in part iconic in part indexical ibid  he adds that in all primitive writing such as the egyptian hieroglyphics there are icons of a nonlogical kind the ideographs and he speculates that in the earliest form of speech there probably was a large element of mimicry ibid  however over time linguistic signs developed a more symbolic and conventional character ibid   symbols come into being by development out of other signs particularly from icons ibid  the historical evidence does indicate a tendency of linguistic signs to evolve from indexical and iconic forms towards symbolic forms alphabets were not initially based on the substitution of conventional symbols for sounds marcel danesi notes that archaeological research suggests that the origins of alphabetical writing lie in symbols previously made out of elemental shapes that were used as imagemaking objects  much like the moulds that figurine and coinmakers use today only later did they take on more abstract qualities danesi   see schmandtbesserat  some of the letters in the greek and latin alphabets of course derive from iconic signs in egyptian hieroglyphs the early scripts of the mediterranean civilizations used pictographs ideographs and hieroglyphs many of these were iconic signs resembling the objects and actions to which they referred either directly or metaphorically over time picture writing became more symbolic and less iconic gelb  this shift from the iconic to the symbolic may have been dictated by the economy of using a chisel or a reed brush cherry   in general symbols are semiotically more flexible and efficient lyons   the anthropologist claude lévistrauss identified a similar general movement from motivation to arbitrariness within the conceptual schemes employed by particular cultures lévistrauss   taking a historical perspective is one reason for the insistence of some theorists that signs are never arbitrary kress  van leeuwen   gunther kress for instance emphasizes the motivation of the sign users rather than of the sign see also hodge  kress   rosalind coward and john ellis insist that every identity between signifier and signified is the result of productivity and a work of limiting that productivity coward  ellis   a distinction is sometimes made between digital and analogical signs indeed anthony wilden declares that no two categories and no two kinds of experience are more fundamental in human life and thought than continuity and discontinuity wilden   whilst we experience time as a continuum we may represent it in either analogue or digital form a watch with an analogue display with hour minute and second hands has the advantage of dividing an hour up like a cake so that in a lecture for instance we can see how much time is left a watch with a digital display displaying the current time as a changing number has the advantage of precision so that we can easily see exactly what time it is now even an analogue display is now simulated on some digital watches we have a deep attachment to analogical modes and we tend to regard digital representations as less real or less authentic  at least initially as in the case of the audio cd compared to the vinyl lp the analoguedigital distinction is frequently represented as natural versus artificial perhaps this is connected in part with the notion that the unconscious  that which we regard as deepest within us  appears to operate analogically wilden   the privileging of the analogical may be linked with the status of the unconscious and the defiance of rationality in romantic ideology which still dominates our conception of ourselves as individuals the deliberate intention to communicate tends to be dominant in digital codes whilst in analogue codes it is almost impossible not to communicate ibid  beyond any conscious intention we communicate through gesture posture facial expression intonation and so on analogical codes unavoidably give us away revealing such things as our moods attitudes intentions and truthfulness or otherwise however although the appearance of the digital watch in  and the subsequent digital revolution in audio and videorecording have led us to associate the digital mode with electronic technologies digital codes have existed since the earliest forms of language  and writing is a digital technology signifying systems impose digital order on what we often experience as a dynamic and seamless flux the very definition of something as a sign involves reducing the continuous to the discrete as we shall see later binary eitheror distinctions are a fundamental process in the creation of signifying structures digital signs involve discrete units such as words and whole numbers and depend on the categorization of what is signified analogical signs such as visual images gestures textures tastes and smells involve graded relationships on a continuum they can signify infinite subtleties which seem beyond words emotions and feelings are analogical signifieds unlike symbolic signifiers motivated signifiers and their signifieds blend into one another there can be no comprehensive catalogue of such dynamic analogue signs as smiles or laughs analogue signs can of course be digitally reproduced as is demonstrated by the digital recording of sounds and of both still and moving images but they cannot be directly related to a standard dictionary and syntax in the way that linguistic signs can bill nichols notes that the graded quality of analogue codes may make them rich in meaning but it also renders them somewhat impoverished in syntactical complexity or semantic precision by contrast the discrete units of digital codes may be somewhat impoverished in meaning but capable of much greater complexity or semantic signification nichols   see also wilden    the art historian ernst gombrich insists that statements cannot be translated into images and that pictures cannot assert  a contention also found in peirce gombrich    peirce   nevertheless whilst images serving such communicative purposes may be more open to interpretation contemporary visual advertisements are a powerful example of how images may be used to make implicit claims which advertisers often prefer not to make more openly in words the italian semiotician umberto eco has criticized the apparent equation of the terms arbitrary conventional and digital by some commentators he notes the way in which the following widespread pairings misleadingly suggest that the terms vertically aligned here are synonymous eco   he observes for instance that a photograph may be both motivated and digital nor is conventionality dependence on social and cultural conventions equivalent to arbitrariness the lack of any intrinsic connection between the signifier and the signified yet it is easy to slip into treating such terms as equivalent  the current text far from immune to this we may as we shall see later be so fond of analogy that we are often perhaps unavoidably its unwitting victims digitalvsanalogical arbitaryvsmotivated conventionalvsnatural another distinction between sign vehicles relates to the linguistic concept of tokens and types which derives from peirce peirce   in relation to words in a spoken utterance or written text a count of the tokens would be a count of the total number of words used regardless of type whilst a count of the types would be a count of the different words used ignoring repetitions in the language of semantics tokens instantiate are instances of their type word and word are instances of the same type language depends on the distinction between tokens and types between the particular instance and the general category this is the basis of categorization john lyons notes that whether something is counted as a token of a type is relative to ones purposes  for instance are tokens to include words with different meanings which happen to be spelt or pronounced in the same way does a capital letter instantiate the same type as the corresponding lowercase letter does a word printed in italics instantiate the same type as a word printed in roman is a word handwritten by x ever the same as a word handwritten by y lyons   from a semiotic pointofview such questions could only be answered by considering in each case whether the different forms signified something of any consequence to the relevant signusers in the context of the specific signifying practice being studied eco lists three kinds of sign vehicles and it is notable that the distinction relates in part at least to material form signs in which there may be any number of tokens replicas of the same type eg a printed word or exactly the same model of car in the same colour signs whose tokens even though produced according to a type possess a certain quality of material uniqueness eg a word which someone speaks or which is handwritten signs whose token is their type or signs in which type and token are identical eg a unique original oilpainting or princess dianas wedding dress eco  ff the typetoken distinction may influence the way in which a text is interpreted in his influential essay on the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction the literaryphilosophical theorist walter benjamin  noted that technological society is dominated by reproductions of original works  tokens of the original type benjamin   indeed even if we do see for instance the original of a famous oilpainting we are highly likely to have seen it first in the form of innumerable reproductions books postcards posters  sometimes even in the form of pastiches or variations on the theme and we may only be able to see the original in the light of the judgements shaped by the copies or versions which we have encountered see intertextuality in the postmodern era the bulk of our texts are indeed copies without originals the typetoken distinction in relation to signs is important in social semiotic terms not as an absolute property of the sign vehicle but only insofar as it matters on any given occasion for particular purposes to those involved in using the sign minute differences in a pattern could be a matter of life and death for gamblers in relation to variations in the pattern on the backs of playingcards within the same pack but stylistic differences in the design of each type of card such as the ace of spades are much appreciated by collectors as a distinctive feature of different packs of playingcards as already indicated saussure saw both the signifier and the signified as nonmaterial psychological forms the language itself is a form not a substance saussure    saussure    he uses several examples to reinforce his point for instance in one of several chess analogies he notes that if pieces made of ivory are substituted for pieces made of wood the change makes no difference to the system saussure   saussure   pursuing this functional approach he notes elsewhere that the pm genevatoparis train is referred to as the same train even though the combinations of locomotive carriages and personnel may change similarly he asks why a street which is completely rebuilt can still be the same street he suggests that this is because it is not a purely material structure saussure   saussure   saussure insists that this is not to say that such entities are abstract since we cannot conceive of a street or train outside of its material realization  their physical existence is essential to our understanding of what they are saussure   saussure   see also ibid  this can be related to the typetoken distinction since saussure sees language in terms of formal function rather than material substance then whatever performs the same function within the system can be regarded as just another token of the same type with regard to language saussure observes that sound as a material element is merely ancillary a material the language uses saussure   saussure   linguistic signifiers are not physical in any way they are constituted solely by differences which distinguish one such sound pattern from another saussure   saussure   he admits at one point with some apparent reluctance that linguistic signs are so to speak tangible writing can fix them in conventional images saussure   saussure   however referring to written signs he comments that the actual mode of inscription is irrelevant because it does not affect the system whether i write in black or white in incised characters or in relief with a pen or a chisel  none of that is of any importance for the meaning saussure   saussure   one can understand how a linguist would tend to focus on form and function within language and to regard the material manifestations of language as of peripheral interest the linguist is interested in types not tokens lyons   this was not only the attitude of the linguist saussure but also of the philosopher peirce the word man does not consist of three films of ink if the word man occurs hundreds of times in a book of which myriads of copies are printed all those millions of triplets of patches of ink are embodiments of one and the same word each of those embodiments a replica of the symbol this shows that the word is not a thing peirce   peirce did refer to the materiality of the sign since a sign is not identical with the thing signified but differs from the latter in some respects it must plainly have some characters which belong to it in itself these i call the material qualities of the sign he granted that materiality is a property of the sign which is of great importance in the theory of cognition materiality had nothing to do with its representative function and it did not feature in his classificatory schemes however he alludes briefly to the signifying potential of materiality if i take all the things which have certain qualities and physically connect them with another series of things each to each they become fit to be signs for instance if the colour of a red flower matters to someone then redness is a sign ibid  whilst saussure chose to ignore the materiality of the linguistic sign most subsequent theorists who have adopted his model have chosen to reclaim the materiality of the sign or more strictly of the signifier semioticians must take seriously any factors to which signusers ascribe significance and the material form of a sign does sometimes make a difference contemporary theorists tend to acknowledge that the material form of the sign may generate connotations of its own as early as  valentin voloshinov published marxism and the philosophy of language which included a materialist critique of saussures psychological and implicitly idealist model of the sign voloshinov described saussures ideas as the most striking expression of abstract objectivism voloshinov   he insisted that a sign is a phenomenon of the external world and that signs are particular material things every sign has some kind of material embodiment whether in sound physical mass colour movements of the body or the like ibid  cf  for voloshinov all signs including language have concrete material reality ibid  and the physical properties of the sign matter psychoanalytic theory also contributed to the revaluation of the signifier  in freudian dream theory the sound of the signifier could be regarded as a better guide to its possible signified than any conventional decoding might have suggested freud   for instance freud reported that the dream of a young woman engaged to be married featured flowers  including liliesofthevalley and violets popular symbolism suggested that the lilies were a symbol of chastity and the woman agreed that she associated them with purity however freud was surprised to discover that she associated the word violet phonetically with the english word violate suggesting her fear of the violence of defloration another word alluding to flowers freud   if this sounds familiar this particular dream motif featured in the film final analysis  as the psychoanalytical theorist jacques lacan emphasized originally in  the freudian concepts of condensation and displacement illustrate the determination of the signified by the signifier in dreams lacan  ff in condensation several thoughts are condensed into one symbol whilst in displacement unconscious desire is displaced into an apparently trivial symbol to avoid dream censorship poststructuralist theorists have sought to revalorize the signifier the phonocentrism which was allied with saussures suppression of the materiality of the linguistic sign was challenged in  when the french poststructuralist jacques derrida in his book of grammatology attacked the privileging of speech over writing which is found in saussure as well as in the work of many other previous and subsequent linguists derrida  from plato to lévistrauss the spoken word had held a privileged position in the western worldview being regarded as intimately involved in our sense of self and constituting a sign of truth and authenticity speech had become so thoroughly naturalized that not only do the signifier and the signified seem to unite but also in this confusion the signifier seems to erase itself or to become transparent derrida   writing had traditionally been relegated to a secondary position the deconstructive enterprise marked the return of the repressed derrida   in seeking to establish grammatology or the study of textuality derrida championed the primacy of the material word he noted that the specificity of words is itself a material dimension the materiality of a word cannot be translated or carried over into another language materiality is precisely that which translation relinquishes  this english translation presumably illustrating some such loss ibid  roland barthes also sought to revalorize the role of the signifier in the act of writing he argued that in classic literary writing the writer is always supposed to go from signified to signifier from content to form from idea to text from passion to expression barthes   however this was directly opposite to the way in which barthes characterized the act of writing for him writing was a matter of working with the signifiers and letting the signifieds take care of themselves  a paradoxical phenomenon which other writers have often reported chandler  ff subsequent theorists have also sought to rematerialize the linguistic sign stressing that words are things and that texts are part of the material world eg coward  ellis  silverman  torode  jay david bolter argues that signs are always anchored in a medium signs may be more or less dependent upon the characteristics of one medium  they may transfer more or less well to other media  but there is no such thing as a sign without a medium bolter   this is a little misleading because as justin lewis notes the sign has no material existence since meaning is brought to words or objects not inscribed within them only the signifier  the unit prior to meaning  exists as a material entity wrenlewis   nevertheless bolters point does apply to the sign vehicle and as hodge and tripp note fundamental to all semiotic analysis is the fact that any system of signs semiotic code is carried by a material medium which has its own principles of structure hodge  tripp   furthermore some media draw on several interacting sign systems television and film for example utilize verbal visual auditory and locomotive signs the medium is not neutral each medium has its own constraints and as umberto eco notes each is already charged with cultural signification eco   for instance photographic and audiovisual media are almost invariably regarded as more real than other forms of representation gunther kress and theo van leeuwen argue that the material expression of the text is always significant it is a separately variable semiotic feature kress  van leeuwen   changing the signifier at the level of the form or medium may thus influence the signified  the sense which readers make of what is ostensibly the same content breaking up a relationship by fax is likely to be regarded in a different light from breaking up in a facetoface situation i have alluded to the problematic distinction between form and content the linguist louis hjelmslev acknowledged that there can be no content without an expression or expressionless content neither can there be an expression without a content or contentless expression hjelmslev   however he offered a framework which facilitated analytical distinctions ibid ff whilst he referred to planes of expression and content saussures signifier and signified he enriched this model ibid  his contribution was to suggest that both expression and content have substance and form thus there are four categories substance of expression form of expression substance of content form of content various theorists such as christian metz have built upon this theoretical distinction and they differ somewhat in what they assign to the four categories see tudor   baggaley  duck   metz  substance form signifiers plane of expression substance of expressionphysical materials of the medium eg photographs recorded voices printed words on paper form of expressionlanguage formal syntactic structure technique and style signifieds plane of content substance of contenthuman content metz textual world subject matter genre form of contentsemantic structure baggaley  duck thematic structure including narrative metz whereas saussure had insisted that language is a form not a substance hjelmslevs framework allows us to analyse texts according to their various dimensions and to grant to each of these the potential for signification such a matrix provides a useful framework for the systematic analysis of texts broadens the notion of what constitutes a sign and reminds us that the materiality of the sign may in itself signify from an explicitly social semiotic perspective gunther kress and theo van leeuwen adapt a linguistic model from michael halliday and insist that any semiotic system has three essential metafunctions the ideational metafunction  to represent in a referential or pseudoreferential sense aspects of the experiential world outside its particular system of signs the interpersonal metafunction  to project the relations between the producer of a sign and the receiverreproducer of that sign and the textual metafunction  to form texts complexes of signs which cohere both internally and within the context in and for which they were produced kress  van leeuwen   specific semiotic systems are called codes contents contents page preface introduction signs modality and representation paradigms and syntagms syntagmatic analysis

signifier and the signified  lexicon  sign vs symbol  mistakes  expansion beyond language  a final word the indeterminancy of meaning  references  related  the sign the signifier and the signified the sign the signifier and the signified are concepts of the school of thought known as structuralism founded by ferdinand de saussure a swiss linguist during lectures he gave between  and  at the university of geneva his views revolutionized the study of language and inaugurated modern linguistics the theory also profoundly influenced other disciplines especially anthropology sociology and literary criticism the central tenet of structuralism is that the phenomena of human life whether language or media are not intelligible except through their network of relationships making the sign and the system or structure in which the sign is embedded primary concepts as such a sign  for instance a word  gets its meaning only in relation to or in contrast with other signs in a system of signs in general the signifier and the signified are the components of the sign itself formed by the associative link between the signifier and signified even with these two components however signs can exist only in opposition to other signs that is signs are created by their value relationships with other signs the contrasts that form between signs of the same nature in a network of relationships is how signs derive their meaning as the translator of saussures course in general linguistics roy harris puts it the essential feature of saussures linguistic sign is that being intrinsically arbitrary it can be identified only by contrast with coexisting signs of the same nature which together constitute a structured system p x in saussures theory of linguistics the signifier is the sound and the signified is the thought the linguistic sign is neither conceptual nor phonic neither thought nor sound rather it is the whole of the link that unites sound and idea signifier and signified the properties of the sign are by nature abstract not concrete saussure a sign is not a link between a thing and a name but between a concept and a sound pattern course p   lexicon at least two other terms are used for signifier and signified signifier  signal  signifiant signified  signification  signifie  sign vs symbol saussure choose the term sign over symbol because the latter implies motivation for saussure the sign is arbitrary virtually all signs saussure maintains have only arbitrarily ascribed meanings since saussure this notion has been taken as axiomatic in western linguistics and philosophy  mistakes a common mistake is to construe the signifier and the sign as the same thing in my view another common mistake perhaps related to the first is to speak of a signifier without a signified or a sign or to speak of a signified without a signifer or a sign used in reference to saussures original formulations both locutions are nonsensical in language a lone signifier would be an utterly meaningless sound or concatenation of sounds but it is even more absurd to speak of a signified without signifier or sign it would i believe have to be a sort of half thought something never thought before a thought that exists solely outside the domain of language a fleeting private chaotic thought that makes no sense even to the thinker  an unthought another mistake is to endow a sign with meaning outside the presence of other signs except as part of the whole system signs do not and cannot exist  expansion beyond language saussure provides an explicit basis for the expansion of his science of signs beyond linguistics it is possible he says to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life  we shall call it semiology it would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them since it does not yet exist one cannot say for certain that it will exist but it has a right to exist a place ready for it in advance roland barthes is one scholar who took saussures counsel to heart he helped found the modern science of semiology applying structuralism to the myths he saw all around him media fashion art photography architecture and especially literature for barthes myth is a system of communication it is a message a mode of signification a form mythologies p  with a plethora of complexities and nuances barthes extends saussures structuralism and applies it to myth as follows myth is a peculiar system in that it is constructed from a semiological chain which existed before it it is a secondorder semiological system that which is a sign namely the associative total of a concept and an image in the first system becomes a mere signifier in the second we must here recall that the materials of mythical speech the language itself photography painting posters rituals objects etc however different at the start are reduced to a pure signifying function as soon as they are caught by myth mythologies p  because of the complexities and nuances of barthess semiology i will stop here and let you pick up the strand for yourself by reading the highly informative chapter myth today in mythologies  a final word the indeterminancy of meaning regardless of how linguistic signs and perhaps other signs too are analyzed meaning may in fact be unrecoverable both to the analyst and to the participants in an exchange of signs it is my belief that meaning is indeed ultimately indeterminate a position that bodes well with what very well be a fact of language with respect to indeterminacy some linguists postmodern theorists and analytic philosophers seem to be in agreement brown and yule both of whom are linguists write that the perception and interpretation of each text is essentially subjective the postmodern theorists meantime hold that every decoding is another encoding jacques derrida for example maintains that the possibility of interpretation and reinterpretation is endless with meaning getting any provisional significance only from speaker hearer or observer meaning is necessarily projection bakhtin too says the interpretation of symbolic structures is forced into an infinity of symbolic contextual meanings and therefore it cannot be scientific in the way precise sciences are scientific both bakhtins and derridas views are surprisingly not unlike those of w v o quines in the indeterminacy of translation where quine argued that the totality of subjects behavior leaves it indeterminate whether one translation of their sayings or another is correct wittgenstein pays homage to the indeterminacy of meaning as well any interpretation still hangs in the air along with what it interprets and cannot give it any support interpretations by themselves do not
