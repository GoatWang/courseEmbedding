therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks share prices

movements   wal is the weighted average life of the portfolio the wal calculation utilizes a securitys stated final maturity date or when relevant the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest such as a put feature accordingly wal reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit widening spreads or tightening liquidity conditions
