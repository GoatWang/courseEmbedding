individualized to each client’s needs for growth income capital preservation proprietary inhouse investment process while many investment advisors effectively “outsource” the investment process to thirdparties through mutual funds or other vehicles palo capital’s core competency is its researchdriven investment process  this enables us to effectively invest assets primarily in individual issues avoiding the layered fees and tax inefficiencies associated with mutual funds investment approach quality at a discount palo capital’s investment approach is based on a multiyear empiricallydriven research effort to develop a process that targets attractive longterm returns consistent performance relative to benchmarks protection against drawdowns during weak market periods the heart of palo capital investment’s process is a quantitative method for rating stocks which we call “quality at a discount”  this method targets quality companies whose stock prices offer good value at an acceptable level of risk  this process entails quantitative assessment of metrics for the following factors quality factors financial productivity margin consistency business momentum value factors multiples of owner earnings shareholder yield etc risk factors operating and financial leverage profit margin variability stock price volatility investment styles are commonly characterized as either “growth” or “value”  palo capital’s quality at a discount  “qad” method combines elements of both the growth and value styles  however the added emphasis on metrics for “quality” introduces a more consistent return profile in comparison to either the growth or value styles based on our research and our results with qad palo capital’s equity strategies implement qad in different ways with the core equity strategy being the purest implementation of the qad process investing insights long term the market may be efficient but in the short term it is not  securities gravitate toward fair value over time but deviate in the short run due to investor emotions and analytical errors legendary investor ben graham probably said this best in the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine corect investment moves are often counterintuitive interpreting widely known information in a way that differs from the consensus  but turns out to be correct  is difficult palo capital’s quantitative orientation helps us stay objective and rational that said we have learned that our best moves are often the ones that we and our clients most question while the seemingly obvious and “easy” trades don’t work out nearly as well   investment strategies capital appreciation core equity equity income fixed income and alternatives palo market neutral performance
