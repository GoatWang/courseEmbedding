mcdermott green and jonsson were gsi employees who purchased the company in  in november  patrick haggerty was hired as general manager of the laboratory and manufacturing lm division which focused on electronic equipment by  the lm division with its defense contracts was growing faster than gsis geophysical division the company was reorganized and initially renamed general instruments inc because there already existed a firm named general instrument the company was renamed texas instruments that same year from  to  fred agnich of dallas later a republican member of the texas house of representatives was the texas instruments president geophysical service inc became a subsidiary of texas instruments early in  most of gsi was sold to the halliburton company texas instruments exists to create make and market useful products and services to satisfy the needs of its customers throughout the world — patrick haggerty texas instruments statement of purpose geophysical service incorporatededit in  j clarence karcher and eugene mcdermott founded geophysical service an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry in  the company reorganized as coronado corp an oil company with geophysical service inc gsi now as a subsidiary on december   mcdermott along with three other gsi employees j erik jonsson cecil h green and hb peacock purchased gsi during world war ii gsi expanded their services to include electronics for the us army signal corps and the us navy in  the company changed its name to texas instruments with gsi becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company an early success story for tigsi came in  when gsi was able under a top secret government contract to monitor the soviet unions underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in vela uniform a subset of project vela to verify compliance of the partial nuclear test ban treaty texas instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry and gsi continued to provide seismic services after selling and repurchasing gsi ti finally sold the company to halliburton in  at which point gsi ceased to exist as a separate entity semiconductorsedit in early  texas instruments purchased a patent license to produce germanium transistors from western electric co the manufacturing arm of att for  beginning production by the end of the year on january   haggerty brought gordon teal to the company as a research director gordon brought with him his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals teals first assignment was to organize what became tis central research laboratories crl which teal based on his prior experience at bell labs among his new hires was willis adcock who joined ti early in  adcock who like teal was a physical chemist began leading a small research group focused on the task of fabricating grownjunction silicon singlecrystal smallsignal transistors adcock later became the first ti principal fellow first silicon transistor and integrated circuitsedit transistorized logic chip an integrated circuit produced by ti in january  morris tanenbaum at bell labs created the first workable silicon transistor this work was reported in the spring of  at the ire offtherecord conference on solid state devices and was later published in the journal of applied physics​ working independently in april  gordon teal at ti created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on april   on may   at the institute of radio engineers ire national conference on airborne electronics in dayton ohteal presented a paper some recent developments in silicon and germanium materials and devices in  texas instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio the regency tr used germanium transistors as silicon transistors were much more expensive at the time this was an effort by haggerty to increase market demand for transistors jack kilby an employee at tis central research labs invented the integrated circuit in  kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july  and successfully demonstrated the worlds first working integrated circuit on september   six months later robert noyce of fairchild semiconductor who went on to cofound intel independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit in  kilby was awarded the national medal of science and in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame kilby also won the  nobel prize in physics for his part of the invention of the integrated circuit noyces chip made at fairchild was made of silicon while kilbys chip was made of germanium in  ti named its new development laboratory kilby labs after jack

first singlechip lpc speech synthesizer in  ti began a feasibility study memory intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed they soon focused on speech applications this resulted in the development the tmc onechip linear predictive coding lpc speech synthesizer which was the first time a single silicon chip had electronically replicated the human voice this was used in several ti commercial products beginning with speak  spell which was introduced at the summer consumer electronics show in june  in  ti left the speech synthesis business selling it to sensory inc of santa clara california consumer electronics and computersedit in may  texas instruments designed and built a prototype of the worlds first transistor radio and through a partnership with industrial development engineering associates idea of indianapolis indiana the  solidstate radio was sold to the public beginning in october of that year in  the handheld calculator sr named after slide rule and in  the handheld scientific calculator sr were issued by ti both had red ledsegmentsnumeric displays the optical design of the sr is somewhat similar to the hp edited by hewlett packard before in early  but buttons for the operations  –  are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighbouring digits ti continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the s and s early on this also included two digital clock models one for desk and the other a bedside alarm from this sprang what became the time products division which made led watches though these led watches enjoyed early commercial success thanks to excellent quality it was short lived due to poor battery life leds were replaced with lcd watches for a short time but these could not compete because of styling issues excessive makes and models and price points the watches were manufactured in dallas and then lubbock texas in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip speech synthesizer and incorporated it in a product called speak  spell which was later featured in the movie et the extraterrestrial several spinoffs such as the speak  read and speak  math were introduced soon thereafter in  ti entered the home computer market with the ti a competitor to such entries as the apple ii tandyradio shack trs and the later atari  series and commodore vic it discontinued the tia  the sequel to the  in late  amidst an intense price war waged primarily against commodore at the  winter ces ti showed models  and the compact computer  cc the latter aimed at professional users the ti professional  ultimately joined the ranks of the many unsuccessful dos and xbased—but noncompatible—competitors to the ibm pc the founders of compaq an early leader in pc compatibles all came from ti the company for years successfully made and sold pccompatible laptops before withdrawing from the market and selling its product line to acer in  defense electronicsedit texas instruments operated this convair  on experimental work in the s fitted with a modified extended nose section texas instruments entered the defense electronics market in  with submarine detection equipment based

developed a line of graphing calculators the first being the ti and most popular being the ti plus with the ti plus being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti has been replaced by the tix iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in  ti released the tinspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator communityedit in the s with the advent of tis graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the tix series of calculators beginning with the ti came with a builtin basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti was the first ti calculator to allow assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas

mcdermott was one of the original founders of geophysical service inc gsi in  mcdermott green and jonsson were gsi employees who purchased the company in  in november  patrick haggerty was hired as general manager of the laboratory and manufacturing lm division which focused on electronic equipment by  the lm division with its defense contracts was growing faster than gsis geophysical division the company was reorganized and initially renamed general instruments inc because there already existed a firm named general instrument the company was renamed texas instruments that same year from  to  fred agnich of dallas later a republican member of the texas house of representatives was the texas instruments president geophysical service inc became a subsidiary of texas instruments early in  most of gsi was sold to the halliburton company texas instruments exists to create make and market useful products and services to satisfy the needs of its customers throughout the world — patrick haggerty texas instruments statement of purpose geophysical service incorporatededit in  j clarence karcher and eugene mcdermott founded geophysical service an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry in  the company reorganized as coronado corp an oil company with geophysical service inc gsi now as a subsidiary on december   mcdermott along with three other gsi employees j erik jonsson cecil h green and hb peacock purchased gsi during world war ii gsi expanded their services to include electronics for the us army signal corps and the us navy in  the company changed its name to texas instruments with gsi becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company an early success story for tigsi came in  when gsi was able under a top secret government contract to monitor the soviet unions underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in vela uniform a subset of project vela to verify compliance of the partial nuclear test ban treaty texas instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry and gsi continued to provide seismic services after selling and repurchasing gsi ti finally sold the company to halliburton in  at which point gsi ceased to exist as a separate entity semiconductorsedit in early  texas instruments purchased a patent license to produce germanium transistors from western electric co the manufacturing arm of att for  beginning production by the end of the year on january   haggerty brought gordon teal to the company as a research director gordon brought with him his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals teals first assignment was to organize what became tis central research laboratories crl which teal based on his prior experience at bell labs among his new hires was willis adcock who joined ti early in  adcock who like teal was a physical chemist began leading a small research group focused on the task of fabricating grownjunction silicon singlecrystal smallsignal transistors adcock later became the first ti principal fellow first silicon transistor and integrated circuitsedit transistorized logic chip an integrated circuit produced by ti in january  morris tanenbaum at bell labs created the first workable silicon transistor this work was reported in the spring of  at the ire offtherecord conference on solid state devices and was later published in the journal of applied physics​ working independently in april  gordon teal at ti created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on april   on may   at the institute of radio engineers ire national conference on airborne electronics in dayton ohteal presented a paper some recent developments in silicon and germanium materials and devices in  texas instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio the regency tr used germanium transistors as silicon transistors were much more expensive at the time this was an effort by haggerty to increase market demand for transistors jack kilby an employee at tis central research labs invented the integrated circuit in  kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july  and successfully demonstrated the worlds first working integrated circuit on september   six months later robert noyce of fairchild semiconductor who went on to cofound intel independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit in  kilby was awarded the national medal of science and in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame kilby also won the  nobel prize in physics for his part of the invention of the integrated circuit noyces chip made at fairchild was made of silicon while kilbys chip was made of germanium in  ti named its new development laboratory kilby labs after jack kilby in  intel samsung lg stericsson huaweis hisilicon technologies subsidiary via telecom and three other undisclosed

in  was assigned the first patent on a singlechip microprocessor invented by gary boone on september   this was disputed by gilbert hyatt formerly of the micro computer company in august  when he was awarded a patent superseding tis this was overturned on june   in favor of ti note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almostsimultaneous invention of the microprocessor first speech synthesis chipedit in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip lpc speech synthesizer in  ti began a feasibility study memory intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed they soon focused on speech applications this resulted in the development the tmc onechip linear predictive coding lpc speech synthesizer which was the first time a single silicon chip had electronically replicated the human voice this was used in several ti commercial products beginning with speak  spell which was introduced at the summer consumer electronics show in june  in  ti left the speech synthesis business selling it to sensory inc of santa clara california consumer electronics and computersedit in may  texas instruments designed and built a prototype of the worlds first transistor radio and through a partnership with industrial development engineering associates idea of indianapolis indiana the  solidstate radio was sold to the public beginning in october of that year in  the handheld calculator sr named after slide rule and in  the handheld scientific calculator sr were issued by ti both had red ledsegmentsnumeric displays the optical design of the sr is somewhat similar to the hp edited by hewlett packard before in early  but buttons for the operations  –  are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighbouring digits ti continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the s and s early on this also included two digital clock models one for desk and the other a bedside alarm from this sprang what became the time products division which made led watches though these led watches enjoyed early commercial success thanks to excellent quality it was short lived due to poor battery life leds were replaced with lcd watches for a short time but these could not compete because of styling issues excessive makes and models and price points the watches were manufactured in dallas and then lubbock texas in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip speech synthesizer and incorporated it in a product called speak  spell which was later featured in the movie et the extraterrestrial several spinoffs such as the speak  read and speak  math were introduced soon thereafter in  ti entered the home computer market with the ti a competitor to such entries as the apple ii tandyradio shack trs and the later atari  series and commodore vic it discontinued the tia  the sequel to the  in late  amidst an intense price war waged primarily against commodore at the  winter ces ti showed models  and the compact computer  cc the latter aimed at professional users the ti professional  ultimately joined the ranks of the many unsuccessful dos and xbased—but noncompatible—competitors to the ibm pc the founders of compaq an early leader in pc compatibles all came from ti the company for years successfully made and sold pccompatible laptops before withdrawing from the market and selling its product line to acer in  defense electronicsedit texas instruments operated this convair  on experimental work in the s fitted with a modified extended nose section texas instruments entered the defense electronics market in  with submarine detection equipment based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry the division responsible for these products was known at different points in time as the laboratory  manufacturing division the apparatus division the equipment group and the defense systems  electronics group dseg during the early s texas instruments instituted a quality program which included juran training as well as promoting statistical process control taguchi methods and design for six sigma in the late s the company along

calculators with the ti being one of the most popular early calculators ti has also developed a line of graphing calculators the first being the ti and most popular being the ti plus with the ti plus being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti has been replaced by the tix iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in  ti released the tinspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator communityedit in the s with the advent of tis graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the tix series of calculators beginning with the ti came with a builtin basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti was the first ti calculator to allow assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before

general manager of the laboratory and manufacturing lm division which focused on electronic equipment by  the lm division with its defense contracts was growing faster than gsis geophysical division the company was reorganized and initially renamed general instruments inc because there already existed a firm named general instrument the company was renamed texas instruments that same year from  to  fred agnich of dallas later a republican member of the texas house of representatives was the texas instruments president geophysical service inc became a subsidiary of texas instruments early in  most of gsi was sold to the halliburton company texas instruments exists to create make and market useful products and services to satisfy the needs of its customers throughout the world — patrick haggerty texas instruments statement of purpose geophysical service incorporatededit in  j clarence karcher and eugene mcdermott founded geophysical service an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry in  the company reorganized as coronado corp an oil company with geophysical service inc gsi now as a subsidiary on december   mcdermott along with three other gsi employees j erik jonsson cecil h green and hb peacock purchased gsi during world war ii gsi expanded their services to include electronics for the us army signal corps and the us navy in  the company changed its name to texas instruments with gsi becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company an early success story for tigsi came in  when gsi was able under a top secret government contract to monitor the soviet unions underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in vela uniform a subset of project vela to verify compliance of the partial nuclear test ban treaty texas instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry and gsi continued to provide seismic services after selling and repurchasing gsi ti finally sold the company to halliburton in  at which point gsi ceased to exist as a separate entity semiconductorsedit in early  texas instruments purchased a patent license to produce germanium transistors from western electric co the manufacturing arm of att for  beginning production by the end of the year on january   haggerty brought gordon teal to the company as a research director gordon brought with him his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals teals first assignment was to organize what became tis central research laboratories crl which teal based on his prior experience at bell labs among his new hires was willis adcock who joined ti early in  adcock who like teal was a physical chemist began leading a small research group focused on the task of fabricating grownjunction silicon singlecrystal smallsignal transistors adcock later became the first ti principal fellow first silicon transistor and integrated circuitsedit transistorized logic chip an integrated circuit produced by ti in january  morris tanenbaum at bell labs created the first workable silicon transistor this work was reported in the spring of  at the ire offtherecord conference on solid state devices and was later published in the journal of applied physics​ working independently in april  gordon teal at ti created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on april   on may   at the institute of radio engineers ire national conference on airborne electronics in dayton ohteal presented a paper some recent developments in silicon and germanium materials and devices in  texas instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio the regency tr used germanium transistors as silicon transistors were much more expensive at the time this was an effort by haggerty to increase market demand for transistors jack kilby an employee at tis central research labs invented the integrated circuit in  kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july  and successfully demonstrated the worlds first working integrated circuit on september   six months later robert noyce of fairchild semiconductor who went on to cofound intel independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit in  kilby was awarded the national medal of science and in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame kilby also won the  nobel prize in physics for his part of the invention of the integrated circuit noyces chip made at fairchild was made of silicon while kilbys chip was made

in  was assigned the first patent on a singlechip microprocessor invented by gary boone on september   this was disputed by gilbert hyatt formerly of the micro computer company in august  when he was awarded a patent superseding tis this was overturned on june   in favor of ti note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almostsimultaneous invention of the microprocessor first speech synthesis chipedit in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip lpc speech synthesizer in  ti began a feasibility study memory intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed they soon focused on speech applications this resulted in the development the tmc onechip linear predictive coding lpc speech synthesizer which was the first time a single silicon chip had electronically replicated the human voice this was used in several ti commercial products beginning with speak  spell which was introduced at the summer consumer electronics show in june  in  ti left the speech synthesis business selling it to sensory inc of santa clara california consumer electronics and computersedit in may  texas instruments designed and built a prototype of the worlds first transistor radio and through a partnership with industrial development engineering associates idea of indianapolis indiana the  solidstate radio was sold to the public beginning in october of that year in  the handheld calculator sr named after slide rule and in  the handheld scientific calculator sr were issued by ti both had red ledsegmentsnumeric displays the optical design of the sr is somewhat similar to the hp edited by hewlett packard before in early  but buttons for the operations  –  are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighbouring digits ti continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the s and s early on this also included two digital clock models one for desk and the other a bedside alarm from this sprang what became the time products division which made led watches though these led watches enjoyed early commercial success thanks to excellent quality it was short lived due to poor battery life leds were replaced with lcd watches for a short time but these could not compete because of styling issues excessive makes and models and price points the watches were manufactured in dallas and then lubbock texas in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip speech synthesizer and incorporated it in a product called speak  spell which was later featured in the movie et the extraterrestrial several spinoffs such as the speak  read and speak  math were introduced soon thereafter in  ti entered the home computer market with the ti a competitor to such entries as the apple ii tandyradio shack trs and the later atari  series and commodore vic it discontinued the tia  the sequel to the  in late  amidst an intense price war waged primarily against commodore at the  winter ces ti showed models  and the compact computer  cc the latter aimed at professional users the ti professional  ultimately joined the ranks of the many unsuccessful dos and xbased—but noncompatible—competitors to the ibm pc the founders of compaq an early leader in pc compatibles all came from ti the company for years successfully made and sold pccompatible laptops before withdrawing from the market and selling its product line to acer in  defense electronicsedit texas instruments operated this convair  on experimental work in the s fitted with a modified extended nose section texas instruments entered the defense electronics market in  with submarine detection equipment based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry the division responsible for these

calculators with the ti being one of the most popular early calculators ti has also developed a line of graphing calculators the first being the ti and most popular being the ti plus with the ti plus being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti has been replaced by the tix iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in  ti released the tinspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator communityedit in the s with the advent of tis graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the tix series of calculators beginning with the ti came with a builtin basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti was the first ti calculator to allow assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before

mcdermott was one of the original founders of geophysical service inc gsi in  mcdermott green and jonsson were gsi employees who purchased the company in  in november  patrick haggerty was hired as general manager of the laboratory and manufacturing lm division which focused on electronic equipment by  the lm division with its defense contracts was growing faster than gsis geophysical division the company was reorganized and initially renamed general instruments inc because there already existed a firm named general instrument the company was renamed texas instruments that same year from  to  fred agnich of dallas later a republican member of the texas house of representatives was the texas instruments president geophysical service inc became a subsidiary of texas instruments early in  most of gsi was sold to the halliburton company texas instruments exists to create make and market useful products and services to satisfy the needs of its customers throughout the world — patrick haggerty texas instruments statement of purpose geophysical service incorporatededit in  j clarence karcher and eugene mcdermott founded geophysical service an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry in  the company reorganized as coronado corp an oil company with geophysical service inc gsi now as a subsidiary on december   mcdermott along with three other gsi employees j erik jonsson cecil h green and hb peacock purchased gsi during world war ii gsi expanded their services to include electronics for the us army signal corps and the us navy in  the company changed its name to texas instruments with gsi becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company an early success story for tigsi came in  when gsi was able under a top secret government contract to monitor the soviet unions underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in vela uniform a subset of project vela to verify compliance of the partial nuclear test ban treaty texas instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry and gsi continued to provide seismic services after selling and repurchasing gsi ti finally sold the company to halliburton in  at which point gsi ceased to exist as a separate entity semiconductorsedit in early  texas instruments purchased a patent license to produce germanium transistors from western electric co the manufacturing arm of att for  beginning production by the end of the year on january   haggerty brought gordon teal to the company as a research director gordon brought with him his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals teals first assignment was to organize what became tis central research laboratories crl which teal based on his prior experience at bell labs among his new hires was willis adcock who joined ti early in  adcock who like teal was a physical chemist began leading a small research group focused on the task of fabricating grownjunction silicon singlecrystal smallsignal transistors adcock later became the first ti principal fellow first silicon transistor and integrated circuitsedit transistorized logic chip an integrated circuit produced by ti in january  morris tanenbaum at bell labs created the first workable silicon transistor this work was reported in the spring of  at the ire offtherecord conference on solid state devices and was later published in the journal of applied physics​ working independently in april  gordon teal at ti created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on april   on may   at the institute of radio engineers ire national conference on airborne electronics in dayton ohteal presented a paper some recent developments in silicon and germanium materials and devices in  texas instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio the regency tr used germanium transistors as silicon transistors were much more expensive at the time this was an effort by haggerty to increase market demand for transistors jack kilby an employee at tis central research labs invented the integrated circuit in  kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july  and successfully demonstrated the worlds first working integrated circuit on september   six months later robert noyce of fairchild semiconductor who went on to cofound intel independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit in  kilby was awarded the national medal of science and in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame kilby also won the  nobel prize in physics for his part of the invention of the integrated circuit noyces chip made at fairchild was made of silicon while kilbys chip was made

in  was assigned the first patent on a singlechip microprocessor invented by gary boone on september   this was disputed by gilbert hyatt formerly of the micro computer company in august  when he was awarded a patent superseding tis this was overturned on june   in favor of ti note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almostsimultaneous invention of the microprocessor first speech synthesis chipedit in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip lpc speech synthesizer in  ti began a feasibility study memory intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed they soon focused on speech applications this resulted in the development the tmc onechip linear predictive coding lpc speech synthesizer which was the first time a single silicon chip had electronically replicated the human voice this was used in several ti commercial products beginning with speak  spell which was introduced at the summer consumer electronics show in june  in  ti left the speech synthesis business selling it to sensory inc of santa clara california consumer electronics and computersedit in may  texas instruments designed and built a prototype of the worlds first transistor radio and through a partnership with industrial development engineering associates idea of indianapolis indiana the  solidstate radio was sold to the public beginning in october of that year in  the handheld calculator sr named after slide rule and in  the handheld scientific calculator sr were issued by ti both had red ledsegmentsnumeric displays the optical design of the sr is somewhat similar to the hp edited by hewlett packard before in early  but buttons for the operations  –  are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighbouring digits ti continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the s and s early on this also included two digital clock models one for desk and the other a bedside alarm from this sprang what became the time products division which made led watches though these led watches enjoyed early commercial success thanks to excellent quality it was short lived due to poor battery life leds were replaced with lcd watches for a short time but these could not compete because of styling issues excessive makes and models and price points the watches were manufactured in dallas and then lubbock texas in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip speech synthesizer and incorporated it in a product called speak  spell which was later featured in the movie et the extraterrestrial several spinoffs such as the speak  read and speak  math were introduced soon thereafter in  ti entered the home computer market with the ti a competitor to such entries as the apple ii tandyradio

being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti has been replaced by the tix iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in  ti released the tinspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator communityedit in the s with the advent of tis graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the tix series of calculators beginning with the ti came with a builtin basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti was the first ti calculator to allow assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before

general manager of the laboratory and manufacturing lm division which focused on electronic equipment by  the lm division with its defense contracts was growing faster than gsis geophysical division the company was reorganized and initially renamed general instruments inc because there already existed a firm named general instrument the company was renamed texas instruments that same year from  to  fred agnich of dallas later a republican member of the texas house of representatives was the texas instruments president geophysical service inc became a subsidiary of texas instruments early in  most of gsi was sold to the halliburton company texas instruments exists to create make and market useful products and services to satisfy the needs of its customers throughout the world — patrick haggerty texas instruments statement of purpose geophysical service incorporatededit in  j clarence karcher and eugene mcdermott founded geophysical service an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry in  the company reorganized as coronado corp an oil company with geophysical service inc gsi now as a subsidiary on december   mcdermott along with three other gsi employees j erik jonsson cecil h green and hb peacock purchased gsi during world war ii gsi expanded their services to include electronics for the us army signal corps and the us navy in  the company changed its name to texas instruments with gsi becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company an early success story for tigsi came in  when gsi was able under a top secret government contract to monitor the soviet unions underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in vela uniform a subset of project vela to verify compliance of the partial nuclear test ban treaty texas instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry and gsi continued to provide seismic services after selling and repurchasing gsi ti finally sold the company to halliburton in  at which point gsi ceased to exist as a separate entity semiconductorsedit in early  texas instruments purchased a patent license to produce germanium transistors from western electric co the manufacturing arm of att for  beginning production by the end of the year on january   haggerty brought gordon teal to the company as a research director gordon brought with him his expertise in growing semiconductor crystals teals first assignment was to organize what became tis central research laboratories crl which teal based on his prior experience at bell labs among his new hires was willis adcock who joined ti early in  adcock who like teal was a physical chemist began leading a small research group focused on the task of fabricating grownjunction silicon singlecrystal

 morris tanenbaum at bell labs created the first workable silicon transistor this work was reported in the spring of  at the ire offtherecord conference on solid state devices and was later published in the journal of applied physics​ working independently in april  gordon teal at ti created the first commercial silicon transistor and tested it on april   on may   at the institute of radio engineers ire national conference on airborne electronics in dayton ohteal presented a paper some recent developments in silicon and germanium materials and devices in  texas instruments designed and manufactured the first transistor radio the regency tr used germanium transistors as silicon transistors were much more expensive at the time this was an effort by haggerty to increase market demand for transistors jack kilby an employee at tis central research labs invented the integrated circuit in  kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july  and successfully demonstrated the worlds first working integrated circuit on september   six months later robert noyce of fairchild semiconductor who went on to cofound intel independently developed the integrated circuit with integrated interconnect and is also considered an inventor of the integrated circuit in  kilby was awarded the national medal of science and in  he was inducted into the national inventors hall of fame kilby also won the  nobel prize in physics for his part of the invention of the integrated circuit noyces chip made at fairchild was made of silicon while kilbys chip was made

transistor radio and through a partnership with industrial development engineering associates idea of indianapolis indiana the  solidstate radio was sold to the public beginning in october of that year in  the handheld calculator sr named after slide rule and in  the handheld scientific calculator sr were issued by ti both had red ledsegmentsnumeric displays the optical design of the sr is somewhat similar to the hp edited by hewlett packard before in early  but buttons for the operations  –  are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighbouring digits ti continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the s and s early on this also included two digital clock models one for desk and the other a bedside alarm from this sprang what became the time products division which made led watches though these led watches enjoyed early commercial success thanks to excellent quality it was short lived due to poor battery life leds were replaced with lcd watches for a short time but these could not compete because of styling issues excessive makes and models and price points the watches were manufactured in dallas and then lubbock texas in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip speech synthesizer and incorporated it in a product called speak  spell which was later featured in the movie et the extraterrestrial

being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti has been replaced by the tix iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in  ti released the tinspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator communityedit in the s with the advent of tis graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the tix series of calculators beginning with the ti came with a builtin basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti was the first ti calculator to allow assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas instruments signing key controversy enthusiasts had already been creating their own operating systems before

instruments invented the handheld calculator a prototype called cal tech in  and the singlechip microcomputer in  was assigned the first patent on a singlechip microprocessor invented by gary boone on september   this was disputed by gilbert hyatt formerly of the micro computer company in august  when he was awarded a patent superseding tis this was overturned on june   in favor of ti note intel is usually given credit with texas instruments for the almostsimultaneous invention of the microprocessor first speech synthesis chipedit in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip lpc speech synthesizer in  ti began a feasibility study memory intensive applications for bubble memory then being developed they soon focused on speech applications this resulted in the development the tmc onechip linear predictive coding lpc speech synthesizer which was the first time a single silicon chip had electronically replicated the human voice this was used in several ti commercial products beginning with speak  spell which was introduced at the summer consumer electronics show in june  in  ti left the speech synthesis business selling it to sensory inc of santa clara california consumer electronics and computersedit in may  texas instruments designed and built a prototype of the worlds first transistor radio and through a partnership with industrial development engineering associates idea of indianapolis indiana the  solidstate radio was sold to the public beginning in october of that year in  the handheld calculator sr named after slide rule and in  the handheld scientific calculator sr were issued by ti both had red ledsegmentsnumeric displays the optical design of the sr is somewhat similar to the hp edited by hewlett packard before in early  but buttons for the operations  –  are in the right of the number block and the decimal point lies between two neighbouring digits ti continued to be active in the consumer electronics market through the s and s early on this also included two digital clock models one for desk and the other a bedside alarm from this sprang what became the time products division which made led watches though these led watches enjoyed early commercial success thanks to excellent quality it was short lived due to poor battery life leds were replaced with lcd watches for a short time but these could not compete because of styling issues excessive makes and models and price points the watches were manufactured in dallas and then lubbock texas in  texas instruments introduced the first singlechip speech synthesizer and incorporated it in a product called speak  spell which was later featured in the movie et the extraterrestrial several spinoffs such as the speak  read and speak  math were introduced soon thereafter in  ti entered the home computer market with the ti a competitor to such entries as the apple ii tandyradio shack trs and the later atari  series and commodore vic it discontinued the tia  the sequel to the  in late  amidst an intense price war waged primarily against commodore at the  winter ces ti showed models  and the compact computer  cc the latter aimed at professional users the ti professional  ultimately joined the ranks of the many unsuccessful dos and xbased—but noncompatible—competitors to the ibm pc the founders of compaq an early leader in pc compatibles all came from ti the company for years successfully made and sold pccompatible laptops before withdrawing from the market and selling its product line to acer in  defense electronicsedit texas instruments operated this convair  on experimental work in the s fitted with a modified extended nose section texas instruments entered the defense electronics market in  with submarine detection equipment based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry the division responsible for these products was known at different points in time as the laboratory  manufacturing division the apparatus division the equipment group and the defense systems  electronics group dseg during the early s texas instruments instituted a quality program which included juran training as well as promoting statistical process control taguchi methods and design for six sigma in the late s the company along with eastman kodak and allied signal began involvement with motorola institutionalizing motorolas six sigma methodology motorola who originally developed the six sigma methodology began this work in  in  the dseg division of texas instruments quality improvement efforts were rewarded by winning the malcolm baldrige national quality award for manufacturing infrared and radar systems ti developed the aaa infrared search and track irst in the late s and early s for the fb phantom for passive scanning of jet engine emissions but possessed limited capabilities and was eliminated on fds and later models in  ti began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and with the addition of a second scan mirror the invention of the first forward looking infrared flir in  with production beginning in  in  ti invented the common module flir concept

developed a line of graphing calculators the first being the ti and most popular being the ti plus with the ti plus being an updated equivalent there are many ti calculators still selling without graphing capabilities the ti has been replaced by the tix iis there are some financial calculators for sale on the ti website in  ti released the tinspire family of calculators as well as computer software that has similar capabilities to the calculators texas instruments calculator communityedit in the s with the advent of tis graphing calculator series programming became popular among some students the tix series of calculators beginning with the ti came with a builtin basic interpreter through which simple programs could be created the ti was the first ti calculator to allow assembly programming via a shell called zshell and the ti was the first in the series to receive native assembly while the earlier basic programs were relatively simple applications or small games the modern assemblybased programs rival what one might find on a game boy or pda around the same time that these programs were first being written personal web pages were becoming popular through services such as angelfire and geocities and programmers began creating websites to host their work along with tutorials and other calculatorrelevant information this led to the formation of ti calculator webrings and eventually a few large communities including the nowdefunct tifiles and stillactive ticalcorg the ti community reached the height of its popularity in the early s with new websites and programming groups being started almost daily in fact the aforementioned community sites were exploding with activity with close to  programs being uploaded daily by users of the sites there was also a competition between both sites to be the top site in the community which helped increase interest and activity in the community one of the common unifying forces that has united the community over the years has been the rather contentious relationship with texas instruments regarding control over its graphing calculators ti graphing calculators generally fall into two distinct groups those powered by the zilog z and those running on the motorola  series both lines of calculators are locked by ti with checks in the hardware and through the signing of software to disable use of custom flash applications and operating systems however users employed the general number field sieve to find the keys and publish them in  ti responded by sending invalid dmca takedown notices causing the texas
