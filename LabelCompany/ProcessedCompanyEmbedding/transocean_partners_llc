rupert hargreaves long only value contrarian deep valuea pauper in the midst of wealthsummarytransocean partners is an attractive propositionthe partnership has a simple structure and the dividend is coveredthe partnership will grow at the expense of the parentwhich is the better investment transocean nyserig or its new master limited partnership transocean partners llc nyserigp there are three key points that make the partnership a more attractive investment proposition than its larger parent earnings strength probably one of the most attractive qualities about transocean partners is the simplicity of the partnerships rig fleet as found within its prospectus on page  this table shows the partnerships current fleet the ownership percentage and period contracted out contract expirations are staggered over the next six years so if management can find new customers there should be almost no disruption in income through to  even then the staggered nature of the contracts should mean that the partnerships income continues to flow for this reason it seems reasonable to suggest that transocean partners income will stay relatively stable over the next few years whats more with only three drilling units in the fleet the partnerships partnersinvestors are able to keep an eye on what the fleet is doing and how its acting the parent transocean is much more difficult to keep tabs on for most investors myself included simplicity is often best and transocean partners fleet is simple and easy to understand in comparison heres an overview of transoceans fleet source transocean presentation pareto securities oil  offshore conference presentation transoceans large varied fleet gives the company an edge over its peers but you really need to understand the dynamics of the rig market to understand the company and its direction there is reason to suggest that transoceans earnings will be highly volatile over the next few years as the rig market goes through a period of change seadrills view on the industry room to grow my own portfolio is mostly made up of smallcaps not because of their potential for growth but for their simplicity smallcaps compared to many multibillion dollar companies are easy to understand balance sheets are less complex management teams are relatively easy to keep an eye on and products can be understood  of course there is more risk transocean partners is a simple company three drilling units is not hard to understand and all three are contracted out for the next few years removing much of the risk currently associated with the offshore drilling market whats more the partnerships income will be stable contract day rates are locked in and potential for growth is already welldocumented on page  of the partnerships prospectus the following information can be found under an omnibus agreement to be entered into on or before the closing of this offering transocean will grant us a right of first offer for its remaining ownership interests in each of the rigcos should transocean decide to sell such interests transocean also will be required to offer us the opportunity to purchase not less than a  percent interest in four of the six drillships listed below within the five years following the closing of this offering at a purchase price equal to the greater of the fair market value taking into account the anticipated cash flows under the associated drilling contracts or the allin construction cost plus transaction costs transocean will select which of these rigs it will offer to us the timing of the offers and whether it will offer us the opportunity to purchase a greater than  percent interest in any offered rig these rigs are as follows so in addition to the partnerships existing fleet of three contracted units an additional six unit interests are available to the partnership through to mid these six interests are already contracted for the most part through to the mids while transocean itself does have the ability to keep these units as covered below its likely that the company will drop the units down to transocean partners in order to free up cash for the dividend distribution or to pay down debt whatever the case the partnerships unitholders are set to benefit as the distribution is bound to grow as these units are delivered unfortunately if transocean does drop down its newer drilling units into the partnership to free up cash the parent will have trouble growing indeed as i have covered in depth here transocean is going to struggle to grow over the next few years as the companys old lowspec fleet struggles in a hostile market environment the article linked above gives a much more detailed overview of the market which i encourage you to read if you havent already dependable dividends transocean partners intends to pay quarterly distributions of  per common unit or  per unit on an annualized basis this is covered on page  of the partnerships prospectus and works out as a gross distribution of  at current levels while this yield is less than the yield being offered by transoceans shares  the payout does look to be more secure with better longterm growth prospects within transocean partners prospectus the partnership states on page  and page  that its distribution  annualized will work out at around  million per year  million per quarter paid from available cash the partnership actually sets out how much cash it will have available for distribution on page  of the prospectus management sets out distribution figures over a threeyear period year ended december   the partnership had  million available for distribution covering the estimated distributions x for the twelve months ended march   just before listing the partnership had  million available for distribution and for the forecasted twelve months ending september   the company will have  million for distribution covering the distributions x cash available for distribution should increase as the partnership acquires more drilling units from the parent so the dividend of transocean partners looks to be relatively secure with room for growth over the long term however transoceans dividend payout which is currently equal to a yield of just over  looks to be under threat according to analysts at ubs  our current estimates the company will need to tap into the full  bil revolver in  and will still be drawing down cash in  we believe transocean will have to make the decision to either reduce the dividend or increase its debt our earnings forecasts are not worst case scenario and assume most of the currently idle rigs return to work in  and that the currently stacked rigs remain stacked we believe dayrate pressure will persist given limited rig tenders demand and fierce competition with dayrates already down  from peak levels regular dropdown proceeds from the mlp should help bolster transoceans fcf however it will not be enough in our view of course this is the view from only one set of analysts and transocean does have the dropdown option to increase cash when transocean partners take on new units from the parent transocean will receive a cash infusion with which it will be able to bulk up the dividend payout once again transocean is at the mercy of falling day rates if the rates remain buoyant then the payout is safe if rates fall as expected then the sustainability of the payout will be called into question of course this is only the view from one set of analysts management was actually quizzed on the sustainability of the dividend payout on the q call analyst  this is a tough question but i would really appreciate a thoughtful answer if you had to choose between an investment grade rating and maintaining your current dividend what do you think is more important to you and the board steven newman  president and ceo  the decision is never that simple the company has to pull before we start thinking about pulling the dividend lever so we will continue evaluate the companys ongoing investment in new build drilling rigs we will evaluate the strength and quality of our balance sheet and the opportunities is available to us well ask the board to engage in a thoughtful review over the coming months and in anticipation of the may  annual general meeting make a decision on the dividend we are committed to maintaining a competitive and sustainable dividend so transocean is likely to consider a payout cut if things are not going to plan as of yet the payout seems secure but transocean partners payout seems to have better longterm outlook the bottom line all in all when choosing the between transocean and its partnership it appears as if the partnership is the better opportunity transocean partners is able to cover its payout and income is to a certain extent locked in over the next few years whats more as transocean drops down rigs to free up cash for itself the partnerships income and distribution should

market share drilling contracts are generally awarded through competitive bidding processes where our customers and potential customers’ main considerations are price quality and technical capability of services and equipment industry supply and demand economics play an important role in the contractual terms including the dayrates we and our customers ultimately agree to as a result of these economic forces in general and the increased number of newbuild units entering the drilling market specifically our ability to obtain future drilling contracts if at all may be subject to increased competition and impact our dayrates and utilization rates in recent years oil companies have placed increased emphasis on exploring for hydrocarbons in deeper waters this deepwater focus is due in part to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost effective therefore water depth capability is a key component in determining rig suitability for a particular drilling project we believe that our fleet of recently constructed highspecification drilling rigs provides us with a competitive advantage over competitors with older fleets company description we are a growthoriented limited liability company recently formed by transocean one of the world’s largest offshore drilling contractors to own operate and acquire modern technologically advanced offshore drilling rigs our initial assets consist of  percent interests in the rigcos that own and operate three ultradeepwater drilling rigs that are currently operating in the us gulf of mexico transocean owns the remaining  percent noncontrolling interest in each of the rigcos we generate revenue through contract drilling services which involves contracting our mobile offshore drilling fleet related equipment and work crews on a dayrate basis to large international energy companies to drill oil and gas wells our drilling rigs currently operate under longterm contracts with chevron and bp two leading international energy companies with an average remaining contract term of approximately  years as of july   we believe that our drilling contracts will generate stable and reliable cash flows over their term we intend to use the relationships and expertise of transocean to recontract our fleet when the existing contracts expire and identify opportunities to expand our fleet
