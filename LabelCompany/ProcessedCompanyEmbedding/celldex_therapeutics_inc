foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search better buy celldex therapeutics inc vs juno therapeutics inc celldex and juno quickly bounced back from highprofile clinical trial failures but which biotech stock is the better buy right now cory renauer tmfangapples feb   at am celldex therapeutics inc nasdaqcldx and juno therapeutics inc nasdaqjuno are two of last years worstperforming biotech stocks both companies suffered upsetting failures with their leading new drug candidates that pushed the possibility of future product sales further into the future luckily both companies had additional candidates to pivot toward after their respective frontrunners crashed and burned to see which of these cancerfocused drugmakers is the better buy right now lets take a look forward to see how they compare image source getty images celldex therapeutics inc strength in diversity celldexs stock cratered after its brain cancer vaccine rintega failed to outperform standard chemotherapy in early  and it hasnt quite recovered yet luckily a return to prerintega crash prices or much higher could be around the corner the companys new lead candidate glemba is a unique cancer therapy that attaches to a protein found on many tumor cell surfaces called gpnmb once inside the cell it releases an ultralethal dose of chemotherapy unlike rintega glemba had some evidence of a statistically significant benefit over standard chemo before celldex decided to sponsor a large and expensive trial intended to support a new drug application during a study with heavily pretreated breast cancer patients whose tumors overexpress glembas target a subset with an extremely difficulttotreat form of the disease survived  longer without showing signs of disease progression than those receiving standard chemo if glemba can repeat this success with similar patients in an ongoing study the stock would soar while it looks like glemba has a solid chance of becoming celldexs first commercialstage product the little biotech has more irons in the fire than its size suggests varlilumab is a novel compound that stimulates the immune system to attack cancer cells its currently being tested in combination with two of the most successful new cancer immunotherapies available today opdivo from bristolmyers squibb and tecentriq from roche another celldex candidate cdx is in the middle of a combination study with incytes epacadostat for the treatment of ovarian cancer last november it acquired another pair of clinicalstage candidates along with privately held koltan pharmaceuticals with a slew of differentiated drugs in human testing there should be plenty of data for this biotechs investors to look forward to juno therapeutics inc positive responses unlike celldexs varied stable of targeted cancer drug candidates junos placed all its chips on cart therapies which involve removing patients immune cells and then reworking them to recognize and attack cancer the cart process is complicated but its produced encouraging response rates among blood cancer patients who had run out of treatment options the companys new lead candidate jcar drove eight of  patients lymphoma into complete remission for at least three months this would be an impressive feat with recently diagnosed patients but this group had already relapsed after a median of four prior lines of therapy juno has plans to start a larger study with jcar later this year and if all goes well it could lead to an approval in  while investors should applaud the biotechs ability to swiftly get back on its feet after a clinical meltdown theres a slight wrinkle kite pharma has a similar therapy thats much further along on the road to its first approvals including the same lymphoma indication in which jcar scored winning marks kite already started submitting data for its experimental cart therapy called axicel to the federal drug administration fda and expects to finish filing the application by the end of march running the numbers if junos jcar can repeat its previous success without any associated patient deaths an approval could lead to annual sales of around  billion at their peak successful trial data could easily lift the stock far above present levels on the other hand at a recent enterprise value of about  billion it also has a long way to fall if the company runs into more unexpected trouble celldex therapeutics already appears to have reached a bottom with a recent enterprise value of around  million an eventual breast cancer approval for glemba alone would send the beatendown biotech stock rocketing into the stratosphere from present levels with a stable of differentiated clinicalstage candidates to fall back on celldex also has an arguably larger safety net than juno in the event of another unexpected setback thats why celldex looks like the better stock pick right now cory renauer
