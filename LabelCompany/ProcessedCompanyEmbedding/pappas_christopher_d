successful enterprise indeed for jim pappas and his father hd who came to america from greece in  but when the next generation came along young chris and harris were encouraged to avoid the restaurant industry and given warnings about its long hours and unpredictable schedules the brothers managed to stay away – for a little while harris earned a finance degree from texas am university and served as a nd lieutenant in the us army chris received a degree in engineering from the university of texas and took a job at ibm computers but the lure of the restaurant biz proved too strong for both brothers soon harris found himself managing his father jims first restaurant the dot coffee shop only to be followed shortly by chris who stepped in at his brothers request by 6 the brothers opened their first restaurant together the strawberry patch and they have been delighting restaurantgoers ever since the pappas brothers now own and operate nearly  restaurants in seven states their nine brands offer something for everyone from fresh gulf coast seafood to cajuninspired cuisine awardwinning steaks and the best texmex on planet texas in addition to being restaurant pioneers the pappas brothers are quite involved in their local community chris and harris give generously of their time to the boy scouts of america memorial hermann healthcare system the boys and girls club and many more community associations in short the pappas brothers are just your everyday exceptional entrepreneurs of greek descent who have made quite a name for themselves in the restaurant business or as harris likes to say the people business basically theyre just glad you like their food yes you and as long as you keep liking it theyll keep making it the pappas brothers opened their first restaurant in 6 and set out to serve only the highest quality food fulfill their guests every request and make sure everyone who walked in the door felt like family since then weve opened more than  restaurants
