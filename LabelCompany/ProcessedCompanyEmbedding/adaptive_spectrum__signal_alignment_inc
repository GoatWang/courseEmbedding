products and technologies enable dsl service providers to automate the management and maintenance of their dsl access networks fundamentally improving performance and returnoninvestment of dsl networks the chief technical obstacles to the costeffective delivery of highspeed services are interference and physical faults in the copper plant physical faults can arise at any point in the plant due to technician or subscriber activities construction activities and even environmental factors such as wind and rain interference is created by a variety of sources appliances in the home other services in the access network such as t and e services and am radio signals in dense deployments of dsl or in deployments with a mix of dslams deployed in central offices and at remote locations eg fttn crosstalk among dsl lines in a cable can be a significant impairment unaddressed these impairments limit dsl speeds and loop lengths reducing an operator’s competitiveness they also result in high rates of customer complaints which often lead to churn and expensive technician dispatches assia’s technology and products directly reduce trouble rates in dsl networks and increase the speed coverage and quality of dsl services assia dsl products assia’s products combine standardized dsl technologies with proprietary analysis methods and highly efficient data collection strategies to automatically stabilize the vast majority of unstable lines in a dsl network via software methods and for the remaining lines to generate actionable pinpoint diagnostics that enable service personnel to efficiently address physical impairments in the copper plant assia provides solutions for dsl operators and for dsl chipset vendors the assia dsl expresse product delivers diagnostics and stabilization of all lines in even the largest dsl networks the operation of the system is depicted in the figure below each line is inspected on a daily basis unstable lines are stabilized by adjustment of their dsl profiles and diagnostic reports are produced for all lines in the network diagnostic reports are available on a perline perdslam and pergeography basis assia’s products for dsl chipset vendors improve the manageability and performance of dsl chipsets while dsl expresse can manage equipment containing any standardscompliant dsl chipset the inclusion of assia rapide and assia chorale technologies in dsl chipsets  enables further gains with respect to performance and control the rapide product enables chipset vendors in creating dsm level ii products see below for the definition of dsm which have the ability to avoid crosstalk interference through shaping of the dsm spectrum chorale enables chipset vendors to create dsm level iii or “vectored” vdsl products which actively cancel crosstalk and can provide speeds in excess of  mbps in fttn dsl deployments dsl management standards assia’s products and technologies work with all standardscompliant dsl equipment delivering consistent management interfaces and strategies in today’s multivendor dsl networks  in addition to the standardized protocols for dsl communications the itut has also standardized the dsl management parameters that must be available from all dsl equipment this standard is known as itut g other industry bodies such as the ietf and the broadband forum have developed standards for the exchange of management parameters between dsl equipment and management platforms such as assia’s and the atis standards organization has defined a collection of methodologies known as dynamic spectrum management or dsm for leveraging these management quantities and protocols to optimize the technical and economic operations of dsl networks the assia products take full advantage of these standards to extract the maximum performance from dsl networks technology advantages from assia assia maintains its industry leadership through continued technical innovation and growth of its worldclass expertise in dsl which includes the original developers of dsl technology today assia’s intellectual property portfolio comprises hundreds of patents and patent applications filed worldwide covering

redwood city calif — adaptive spectrum and signal alignment inc assia® extreme high frequency submillimeter waves can increase singleline data rates to terabitssecond at  meter lengths on ordinary twisted pair phone wire  speeds of  gigabitssecond can be achieved at distances over  meters and speeds of  gigabitssecond can be achieved at distances over  meters dr john cioffi chairman and ceo of assia and emeritus professor at stanford explains “fiberlike speeds of  – ’s of gigabitssecond gbps are possible by using the previously unexploited waveguide modes of current copper infrastructure waveguidemode use is similar to use of millimeterwave transmissions in advanced wireless and g  waveguides can enable use of frequencies above  ghz for extraordinary speeds”  assia develops management and optimization software for broadband and wifi networks cioffi’s keynote at the paris gfast summit conference on may   titled “terabit dsl” will introduce the new method  during the keynote dr cioffi will explain how g wireless often runs at  ghz and  ghz while commercial microwave gear can run at  ghz and  ghz  wireless above  ghz submillimeter wave is being actively researched  early designs suggest link latency of  microsec is readily achievable which would easily allow even the most stringent g latency specifications of ms or less to be achieved with these terabit dsls today’s fastest dsl gfast uses only  mhz while wireless uses  times as much spectrum “the challenge was to develop practical ways to use higher frequencies over wires  working with my assia colleagues dr chan soo hwang dr ken kerpez and dr ioannis kanellakopoulos we found a solution” cioffi adds “i don’t expect anyone to need terabitss tbps to their home anytime soon terabitss will be most valuable to the data centers controlled by phone companies as well as to internet companies such as google and microsoft  while tbps demand may be a few years into the future  gbps speeds are important to networks today and will be a big market  rapid advances in the internet of things iot including autonomous vehicles means the number of connected devices requiring highspeed ubiquitous connectivity will increase dramatically in the next decade  we believe that terabit dsl will play a critical role in serving the needs of that ecosystem with ultrahighthroughput and ultralowlatency connectivity” further driving the demand for bandwidth “hundreds of thousands of g small cells and docsis  cable nodes will require  gigabit backhaul  most g cells will connect to a cloud ran controller that can use  gigabitss to support dozens of cells” “att and other telcos around the world are also deploying gfast to apartments gfast speeds of  megabits to a gigabit can be supplied to every apartment  this differs from cable which has shared connections that require multigigabit backhaul” “fiber is and always will be expensive to deploy there are a billion phone lines around the world which will now be able to deliver fiberlike speeds over existing copper infrastructure  using the existing wires in place can dramatically reduce the cost of g networks” “there are a few years of work ahead in the industry to refine the system lte and now g wireless have proven major advances can evolve from concept to deployment in five to seven years data centers at google and facebook can leverage such new technologies in only a few years” dr cioffi’s gfast summit presentation may be found here httpwwwassiainccomterabitdsl about the contributors dr john cioffi john cioffi is chairman and ceo of assia
