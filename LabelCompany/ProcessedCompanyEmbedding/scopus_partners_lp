scimago to offer multidimensional evaluation of research journals metrics to be powered by scopus and freely available online share this   amsterdam  january  – elsevier a worldleading publisher of scientific technical and medical information products and services today announced that its flagship product scopus has successfully partnered with the centre for science and technology studies cwts and the scimago research group endorsing two complementary journal metrics snip and sjr the metrics will be freely available online at wwwjournalmetricscom and integrated into scopus allowing researchers around the world to analyze journals within the abstract and citation database the indicators will offer a greater currency and flexibility in journal performance measurement than any singlemetric method currently available snip which stands for source normalized impact per paper measures a journals contextual citation impact and was developed by cwts it allows direct comparison of journals in different subject fields by accounting for the frequency at which authors cite other papers the speed of maturation of citation impact and the extent to which the database covers the fields literature sjr stands for scimago journal rank and was developed by the scimago research group it is a measure of the scientific prestige of scholarly sources value of weighted citations per document a journal transfers its own prestige or status to another through the act of citing it in effect this means that a citation from a source with a relatively high sjr is worth more than a citation from a source with a lower sjr putting snip and sjr side by side and applying them to the breadth and depth of the scopus database which covers the greatest number of journal titles including local language titles from developed and emerging countries the new offering represents the most inclusive bibliometric analytics available for journals their integration helps to meet the evolving needs of the scientific community by providing current flexible transparent data to empower users to build their own tailored journal ranking systems “for many years the scientific community has called for more accurate metrics that move beyond standard journal classification” said niels weertman director scopus performance  planning and collaboration tools for elsevier “we are pleased to have the opportunity to partner with cwts and scimago to power the next level of bibliometric analysis bringing a more nuanced approach we hope to enhance research performance measurement” “it’s long been understood that no single journal metric can realistically address the needs of the research community” added professor henk f moed currently a senior staff member with cwts in the department of social sciences at leiden university who will be joining elsevier as a senior scientific advisor next month “our challenge was to develop a more flexible system matching the strengths and weaknesses of one metric to another complementary metric we were able to fill many of the existing analytical gaps we hope to further expand the number of metrics working alongside each other in the future” “by aligning our sjr indicator with snip and leveraging the coverage breadth and depth of scopus we are confident that the outcome is the most complete bibliometric analysis available today” stated professor félix de moya anegón of the centre for human and social sciences cchs of the spanish national research council csic in madrid and director of scimago “we’re also excited by the new opportunity this creates for communitygenerated ranking systems that more closely meet market needs and draw a more accurate picture of research output” the journal metrics will be updated twice annually and made available to scopus subscribers at   httpwwwscopuscom and to nonscopus users at wwwjournalmetricscom free of charge additional information on the sjr and snip indicators is available through the following recent publications “measuring contextual citation impact of scientific journals” henk moed creator of snip “the sjr indicator a new indicator of journals scientific prestige”
