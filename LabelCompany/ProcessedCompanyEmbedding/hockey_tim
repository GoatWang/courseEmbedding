from  cents per doughnut to  cents required the purchase of new freezers and microwaves and reduced profitability for the franchises while increasing profits for the parent company franchise owners are required to purchase food products from the brantfordbased parbaking company owned by iaws group plc and had originally been told the price of each doughnut would be  or  cents and each timbit  cents the case was dismissed in february  a  new york times article contrasted the baked from scratch at stores approach of krispy kreme and some dunkin donuts locations compared to the flash frozen

 million prizes were distributed each year including vehicles televisions and store products customers determine if they have won prizes by unrolling the rim on their paper cups when they have finished their drink revealing the result underneath prizes are not distributed randomly countrywide each of the companys distribution regions has distinct prizewinning odds the idea for the campaign began in  when roger wilson of one of tim hortons supplier of cups lily cup company approached tim hortons with a new idea to increase their sales wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim the cup type cost no more than the current one and could enable a promotion like a contest recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak sales period in the spring the roll up the rim to win campaign was first held in  when the biggest prize was a snackbox of timbits in  over  of major prizes were redeemed the contest

per capita and have more doughnut outlets per capita than any other nation tim hortons prevalence in the coffee and doughnut market has led to its branding as a canadian cultural icon the media routinely refer to its iconic status despite this being a relatively recent development there were only a few outlets before the chains expansion in the late s and s a series of tims television commercials promotes this idea by showing vignettes of canadians abroad and their homesickness for tim hortons noted canadian author pierre berton once wrote in so many ways the story of tim hortons is the essential canadian story it is a story of success and tragedy of big dreams and small towns of oldfashioned values and toughfisted business of hard work and of hockey some commentators have bemoaned the rise of tim hortons as a national symbol rudyard griffiths director of the dominion institute wrote in the toronto star in july  that the ascension of the chain to the status of cultural icon was a worrying sign for canadian nationalism adding surely canada can come up with a better moniker than the timbit nation the recognition of tim hortons as a canadian icon has permeated into

bemoaned the rise of tim hortons as a national symbol rudyard griffiths director of the dominion institute wrote in the toronto star in july  that the ascension of the chain to the status of cultural icon was a worrying sign for canadian nationalism adding surely canada can come up with a better moniker than the timbit nation the recognition of tim hortons as a canadian icon has permeated into
