you see it in iwata’s use of multiple forms of internet social networking tools like twitter facebook youtube and others on a professional level his let’sallsharewhatweknow philosophy drives his work as ibm’s senior vice president of marketing and communications “the ability to put everything together from influencer work to policy thinking employees analysts the media the bloggers the vcs the advertising world the direct marketing world and have that aligned so we speak with once voice against all of these audiences is the promised land” he declares iwata believes that encouraging ibm’s  employees to use the internet’s vast social networking resources to share their enthusiasms and grumbles with all and sundry will help ibm bolster its place as the industry leader in corporate information technology and consulting space that vision is also reflected in the ibm smarter planet advertising campaign which he kicked off in  iwata sees the internet’s latest incarnation — what he calls web  — as “tapping into the power of billions of people having the tools and the power to produce their own content and publish their own points of view and connect with each other” this passion for harnessing communications in all forms as a creative force in business is reflected in the way ibm has folded so many core functions into iwata’s domain it has expanded beyond controlling and

by tom foremski  september 7  ive been fascinated with jon iwata ever since he was appointed head of ibms corporate communications and marketing its highly unusual for one person to hold both positions and it could mark the beginning of a new trend as a senior vp of marketing and communications at ibm the worlds largest computer company mr iwata has a tremendous amount of influence within the computer industry and beyond its the combination of such roles that interests me greatly because it offers the possibility of a completely new role with new vistas of possibilities im curious about what this means for ibm and if such a pioneering role could be replicated at other companiesjerry swerling director of pr studies and the usc annenberg strategic pr center describes mr iwata as a man whose name invariably comes up when you ask knowledgeable professionals to name the smartest most forwardthinking people in the business here ive spoken with mr iwata and with ben edwards ibm vp and director of digital strategy and development check back later this week for the interview but first here is some background on mr iwata and his leadership in an initiative within ibm focused on citizenship and ibms smarter planet strategy i include a video and some extracts from his speeches bio from ibm press room  jon c iwata  senior vice president marketing and communications  united

current role on july   here is an extract from a speech at the yale club in november  via toni muzi falconi at pr conversations one day soon every employee every retiree every customer every business partner every investor and every neighbor associated with every company will be able to share an opinion about that company with everyone in the world based on firsthand experience the only way we can be comfortable in that world is if every employee of the company is truly grounded in what their company values and stands for what are we doing about this at ibm we have created a new discipline within my organization that puts together brand management and workforce enablement or what we used to call internal communications this may sound to some like external and internal messaging coming together  employee as brand ambassador sure thats an aspect of it but the centerpiece is something quite different we call it the ibm brand system picture a framework with five columns from left to right the columns are labeled what it means to look like ibm to sound like ibm to think like ibm to perform like ibm and ultimately to be ibm here is an extract from a speech on the future of pr at

when you think about the pr profession  what itll look like  years from now  start not with pr but with the world at large not with the decade but the century said iwata adding that a century from now the world will look back on the early th century as a time when civilization took a great leap forward marked by changes in what people know changes in what people expect and ultimately changes in behavior though attempting to analyze such a period of change while simultaneously experiencing it continues to prove difficult iwata identified new disciplines in the corporate function emerging from an environment characterized by transparency and readily available information at the core of these emergent disciplines is a stress on behavior managementa sense of corporate integrity permeated down to and communicated directly from the individual employee lincoln said character is like a tree reputation is like its shadow iwata said many believe their job is to manipulate the shadow rather than tend to the health of the tree in this world of transparency and democratized media it is increasingly difficult for organizations and individuals to lead double lives there can be no image management without behavior management people care about the corporation behind the soft drink or bank account or computer  they do not divorce their opinions of that company from the companys products and services iwata went on to suggest that the behavior and subsequent image of a company goes far beyond the surface indicating a need for the instillment of unique corporate values among all employees as they only matter if lived and applied consistently by everyone in the company according to iwata it is through the consistent maintenance of and adherence to a brands values and promise that they are able to succeed in another emerging disciplinethat of building constituencies the idea of merely reaching an audience and achieving message penetration is not enough pumping out information only adds to the nosie and compounds the challenge of being heard value will come from offering perspective and useful information and providing a contribution to our audiences knowledge citing apple as a company that does this well iwata suggested they dont just advertise they teach they dont just sell they create learning experiences in their stores they want you to learn everything their product can do so then you will teach others in the process they recruit new and loyal customers that become advocates and evangelists crafting and disseminating a valuable message and building this constituency is no longer however the task of solely communications professionals iwata described a third and final major shift as the development of the eminence of a companys workforcetraining employees to act and communicate as experts who produce valuable information for the public and extend the power of the brand  is the year that corps grapple with and ultimately accept that their employees are
