challenges to patent rightslawsuits over drugsmedical marijuanacorporate historyestablished  history dates back to  headquarters chicago il founder wallace c abbott size  employees in  countries popular products humira imbruvica viekira lupron androgel marinol  revenue  billion abbvie the fledgling researchbased biopharmaceutical company netted  billion in sales in its first year growing to  billion in  largely on the strength of humira its blockbuster arthritis drug now the company with  employees in  countries markets more than  products and has more than  drugs in development the company focuses on four therapeutic areas where it says it has proven expertise those areas are immunology oncology neuroscience virology according to its website abbvie “takes on the toughest health challenges but we do more than treat diseases — we aim to make a remarkable impact on people’s lives” although the company has faced some legal issues with lawsuits accusing it of fraudulent marketing of a testosteroneenhancing drug for example it has maintained a stellar reputation in the industry the bostonbased reputation institute announced in may  that abbvie had the best reputation among pharma companies the ranking was based on more than  reputation rankings in eight markets brazil france italy spain the united kingdom and the united states in seven measured areas of reputation abbvie led in three of them workplace governance and citizenship “since the company’s inception less than five years ago we have worked to raise a better understanding of abbvie among our key stakeholders” said laura schumacher executive vice president of external affairs at abbvie “we are pleased that these efforts have resonated with our global audience and driven greater understanding of who we are and what we stand for as a company” according to the reputation institute higher reputation ratings translate in increases in the likelihood that people will recommend a company “in a world where word of mouth is becoming more and more critical reputation is proving to be a key driver of business success and that’s why the leading companies are actively measuring and managing it” said kaspar ulf nielsen an official at the reputation institute abbvie’s drugs make billions fact abbvie’s arthritis drug humira is the world’s topselling drug bringing in  billion in  by far abbvie’s biggest sales generator — also the world’s topselling drug — is the arthritis drug humira which brought in a jawdropping  billion in  forbes has called humira one of the biggest selling products of all time to put that in some perspective that’s more than the national government budgets of more than  countries including panama  billion jordan  billion and iceland  billion all that revenue comes at a steep cost to patients insurance companies and taxpayers who can pay  a year or more per patient for the drug abbvie spends heavily marketing its crown jewel in  the company spent  million marketing humira also used to treat psoriasis and crohn’s disease humira accounts for more than  percent of abbvie’s total annual sales perhaps not surprisingly other pharmaceutical companies are looking for a piece of that action humira works by blocking proteins called tumor necrosis factor tnf which are naturally produced by the immune system part of the reason for the highlevel of revenue is that abbvie doubled the price of the drug over a threeyear period the price actually went up about  percent every three months according to one analyst humira works by blocking certain proteins called tumor necrosis factor tnf which is naturally produced by the immune symptom an overproduction of the proteins has been linked to crohn’s disease and other inflammation conditions abbvie lawsuits and challenges to patent rights humira is the focus of patent fights as rivals seek to make generic versions known as biosimilars and abbvie tries to stave them off by filing new patents to keep the generics off the market abbvie has filed more than  new patents on humira covering such things as formulations manufacturing methods and uses in may  abbvie lost a round to the company coherus on a case in which it challenged one of abbvie’s patents however according to fortune other patents should protect abbvie’s sales through  “any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate which abbvie intends to enforce vigorously” said abbvie chairman and chief executive officer richard a gonzalez according to the new york times “any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate which abbvie intends to enforce vigorously” richard a gonzalez abbvie chairman and chief executive officer but abbvie isn’t relying solely on humira in the arthritis market it’s positioning a new drug upadacitinib which in june  succeeded in a latestage study on patients who hadn’t responded well to other treatments if the new drug gets the goahead from the fda it could ease the company’s reliance on humira patients allege drug injuries humira has also been the subject of some litigation by people who say they were injured after taking the drug abbott was ordered by a jury in  to pay a north dakota family  million in the case of delores tietz who took the drug for almost seven months in  until suffering from a fungal infection caused by the drug she spent  months in the hospital and had to undergo physical and speech therapy close up of histoplasmosis an invasive fungal infection the fda in  required the makers of tnf blocking drugs like humira to strengthen existing warnings on the risk of developing fungal infections after some patients with the infections died although the risk of serious infections had been included in the prescribing information since the drugs were approved the fda said health care professionals weren’t always recognizing cases of histoplasmosis and other invasive fungal infections leading to some delays in treatment in  the fda required makers of tnf blockers including humira to update the boxed warning to alert healthcare professionals of an increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies in children and adolescents treated with the drugs other top performers although their revenue isn’t anywhere near humira’s other abbvie top performers include imbruvica cancer drug with  billion in  world sales viekira hepatitis c at  billion and lupron synthetic hormone coming in at  million then there’s synthroid thyroid at  million and synagis prevents severe respiratory disease in infants and creon replaces pancreatic enzymes each at  million troubled testosterone booster androgel generated  million in sales in  a tumble from  when sales were at  billion sales of the drug dropped precipitously in  after the food and drug administration required a warning that testosterone supplements could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes abbvie has sought fda approval to market imbruvica for additional conditions including chronic graftversushost disease lawsuits over some of abbvie’s drugs the company faces thousands of lawsuits from men who say they suffered heart attacks and other injuries after taking androgel the plaintiffs accuse the company and others of fabricating a condition called “low t” in order to explode the market for a product that had been received fda approval for a specific disease the company is also accused of failing to disclose known risks associated with taking the drug androgel was marketed as a solution to the natural symptoms of aging abbvie and other companies are defendants in more than  lawsuits in federal court in multidistrict litigation chicago as well as hundreds of cases in various state courts the lawsuits allege abbvie aggressively marketed androgel as the solution to the natural symptoms of aging such as fatigue and grumpiness the plaintiffs say they were injured when they took the drug which had risks that were known as far back as the s but were never disclosed to patients abbvie says the fda approval process and regulations were followed and that its marketing practices were covered by the first amendment it is also challenging whether androgel caused the specific injuries suffered in a statement emailed to bloomberg abbvie spokeswoman toni haubert said “we believe our disease education and marketing of androgel have adhered strictly to fdaapproved uses and are in full compliance with applicable standards” abbvie also sells the antiseizure drug depakote but it is not one of the company’s top sellers in  abbott agreed to pay  billion for illegal marketing of the drug which is the focus of lawsuits over birth defects suffered by children of mothers who took it during pregnancy in february  a federal jury in cleveland ruled in favor of abbott and abbvie in the case of a woman who had sued the companies claiming they were responsible for her son’s birth defects after she took depakote while pregnant medical marijuana another of abbvie’s drugs marinol has caused some analysts to classify abbvie as a medical marijuana maker that’s because marinol’s active ingredients is a synthetic cannabinoid — manmade deltatetrahydrocannabinol or thc marinol was the first fdaapproved cannabis drug marinol received fda approval in  for chemotherapyrelated nausea and vomiting and in  to treat anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with aids it was the first fdaapproved cannabis drug marinol was developed by solvay pharmaceuticals in  abbott bought solvay’s pharmaceutical division including marinol abbvie doesn’t release its sales numbers but analysts think they may be suffering because of the availability of generic versions of the drug according to one report solvay said in  that the drug had generated more than  million but those numbers sank to less than half of that when generics came on the market the following year abbvie’s corporate history although abbvie is relatively new it builds on the year history of abbott laboratories founded in  by dr wallace c abbott started making tiny “dosimetric granules” tiny pills made from medicinal plants which he sold in his drugstore in chicago abbott announced the planned split in  maintaining the parts of the business that concentrated on medical devices such as heart stents and allowing abbvie to focus on researchbased pharmaceuticals the company says its name represents its connection to the past and future analysts said the spinoff allowed investors to choose levels of risk and possible reward with the pharmaceuticals having higher levels of both potential risk and possible payoff abbvie was led from the outset by gonzalez a veteran abbott executive since it split from abbott abbvie has increased its annual research and development investment from  billion in  to  billion in  and it says its

million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined fact only  percent of americans have a good opinion of big pharma only  percent of americans have a good opinion of big pharma in fact they are the second most hated industry in the us they are also the biggest defrauder of the federal government under the false claims act according to consumer watchdog group public citizen the reputation institute evaluated public perception of  pharmaceutical companies for products and services innovation workplace governance citizenship and financial performance the institute based its results on  ratings from the us uk canada and other countries of all the countries the us had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies older people had the most favorable

big pharma’s influence critics contend that big pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers the fda and the public to increase sales the public is exposed to pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising for example critics say abbvie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as androgel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men they created a marketing campaign around the condition “low t” that featured a quiz for men to selfdiagnose low t symptoms androgel above was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up the testosterone market soared into the billions as a result but few studies back up drugcompany claims that the drug significantly enhances mood vitality and sexual performance studies also link these drugs to heart problems the fda added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk the american public is not the only sector of society influenced by big pharma’s techniques doctors scientists and research organizations medical journals teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to big pharma doctors conduct research with funds from big pharma private charities and foundations account for a mere  percent of the estimated  billion spent on biomedical research in the us each year pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately  percent big pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout the trade group phrma has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena including  who worked for a member of congress  who worked for a federal agency  who worked for a congressional committee two who worked for the white house one who worked in the court system using these connections to pursue industry goals big pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest marketing research and development rd and drug cost americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases thousands of dollars more per prescription big pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug cost facts while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the truth is that us law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from freemarket competition other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug the true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery with many unverifiable figures reported by big pharma donald light a professor and expert on the pharma business model said that while companies claim each new drug costs them  billion the true cost is more like  million the industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing which is almost double what it spends on research big pharma sways opinions the large amount of cash big pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on directtoconsumer advertising the us is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on tv the other is new zealand in  big pharma spent  billion on directtoconsumer ads and fired off about  ads an hour according to nielsen big pharma also employs doctors researchers and institutions the industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal paid copywriters were used in advertising paxil above often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product big pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs including the antidepressant paxil the recalled weight loss drug fenphen the antiepilepsy drug neurontin the antidepressant zoloft and painkiller vioxx to name a few in addition even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on big pharma’s payroll these slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence yet richard smith former editor of the british medical journal says “all journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry” big pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications consider the numbers advertising instead of research for every  spent on “basic research” big pharma spends  on promotions and advertising distribution of free drug samples the us has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five officebased physicians sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors including covering meals travel seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations many medical journals including the esteemed journal of the american medical association jama actively vie for the attention of big pharma advertising dollars billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership how big pharma influences doctors and researchers part of big pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive brand name drugs fact in  big pharma spent  billion on physician advertising according to pew charitable trusts drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty one  study in jama internal medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than  they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug according to propublica’s dollars for docs investigation  companies paid  billion to doctors and hospitals from august  to december  drug and device company payments to doctors from select companies august  to december  company payments depuy johnson  johnson  million stryker corporation  million astrazeneca  million pfizer  million janssen pharmaceuticals  million glaxosmithkline  million boston scientific  million big pharma and researchers then there are medical researchers who are hardly immune to big pharma’s financial power because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers sponsors keep the data analyze it write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication drug companies also stagemanage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light medical schools and big pharma big pharma has also infiltrated medical schools teachers department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors this influences educational content money from big pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs the result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drugintensive style of medicine sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer more expensive drugs are always better than old ones in most states doctors must also take accredited education courses called continuing medical education cme the pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on cme annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool in addition academic centers are able to receive royalties from big pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds columbia university for example received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products columbia university received nearly  million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesbig pharma fraud settlements in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud according to public citizen’s  report pharmaceutical industry settlements  through  fact in a year period big pharma companies paid  settlements totaling  billion for marketing fraud the most common charge involved drugpricing scams against state medicaid programs this meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while big pharma made billions unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements but these investigations take many years to complete by then drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion while the us department of justice fine is typically only a few million this makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies according to michael bobelian of forbes magazine manufacturer directory several of the biggest drug and medical device companies sell the majority of their products in the us many of these products are involved in product liability litigation some of the companies’ bestselling drugs brought in over a billion in  according to company annual reports abbvie quick facts business sells and markets more than  drugs in the us

factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
