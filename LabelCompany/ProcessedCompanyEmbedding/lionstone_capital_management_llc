hunts for investments within certain internationally competitive cities where the most productive us professional workers congregate lionstone’s advanced analytics isolates geographic areas and then drills down into submarkets and specific locations—revealing where the highest economic productivity and greatest demand for space exists relative to supply it’s the simple idea of a space combined
