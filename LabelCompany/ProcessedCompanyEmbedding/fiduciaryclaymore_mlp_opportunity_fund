interest expense investment objective the funds investment objective is to provide a high level of aftertax total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its managed assets in mlp entities and invests at least  of its managed assets in equity securities of mlp entities it is anticipated that a substantial portion of the mlp entities in which the fund will invest will be engaged primarily in the energy natural resources and real estate sectors if this expectation is not realized the fund will have a larger corporate income tax expense than expected which will result in less cash available to distribute to shareholders while the fund will generally seek to maximize the portion of the fund’s distributions to common shareholders that will consist of taxdeferred return of capital no assurance can be given in this regard the fund may also invest in the common stock of largecapitalization companies including companies engaged primarily in the aforementioned sectors to seek to generate current income and gains the fund may employ an option strategy of writing selling covered call

assets in unregistered or otherwise restricted securities issued by public and nonpublic companies including up to  of its managed assets in security issued by nonpublic companies the fund may also invest up to  of its managed assets in debt securities of mlp entities and nonmlp entity issuers including securities rated below investmentgrade the fund anticipates that a substantial portion of the mlp entities in which the fund invests will be engaged in the energy sector as a result the fund will be more susceptible to adverse global and domestic economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector and additional risks including commodity price volatility the risk of supply and demand variances interestrate risk catastrophic event risk and the possibility of resource depletion an additional risk to consider is that energy sector mlp entities owned by the fund may depend on their ability to make acquisitions that increase adjusted operating surplus per unit in order to enhance distributions to unit holders the fund’s concentration in the natural resources sector makes the fund more susceptible to risks inherent in that sector including commodity price volatility exchange rates import controls competition environmental regulation and liability resource depletion and the impact of inflation investing in unregistered or restricted securities entails various risks such securities are often more difficult to evaluate and the sale of such securities often requires more time and results in higher selling expenses than does the sale of more liquid exchangelisted securities restrictions on the resale of such securities may result in an event where a considerable period of time may elapse between a decision to liquidate a security and the time when the fund would be permitted to sell during which time the fund would bear additional market risks the fund’s potential investment in securities of below investmentgrade quality involves special risks in addition to the risks associated with an investment in investmentgrade securities lowergrade securities typically entail greater price volatility and may be less liquid than higherrated securities lowergrade securities are commonly referred to as “junk bonds” because of their predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal these securities may also be more susceptible to adverse economic and competitive industry conditions than higherrated securities for periodic shareholder reports and recent fundspecific

shares when an investor wants to sell shares when selling an openend fund the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the nav is calculated unlike the openend fund a

inc  forsyth boulevard suite  st louis mo  risks not a complete investment program the fund is intended for investors seeking a high level of aftertax total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders over the long term the fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish to play short term swings in the stock market an investment in the common shares of the fund should not be considered a complete investment program each common shareholder should take into account the funds investment objective as well as the common shareholders other investments when considering an investment in the fund investment and market risk an investment in the fund is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest an investment in the common shares of the fund represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund the value of those securities may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably the value of the securities owned by the fund will affect the value of the common shares at any point in time your common shares may be worth less than your original investment including the reinvestment of fund dividends and distributions risks of investing in mlp units an investment in mlp units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities such as common stock of a corporation holders of mlp units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common shareholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units additionally conflicts of interest may exist between common unit holders subordinated unit holders and the general partner of an mlp for example a conflict may arise as a result of incentive distribution payments tax risks much of the benefit the fund derives from its investment in equity securities of mlps is a result of mlps generally being treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes partnerships do not pay us federal income tax at the partnership level rather each partner of a partnership in computing its us federal income tax liability will include its allocable share of the partnerships incomegains losses deductions and expenses a change in current tax law or a change in the business of a given mlp could result in an mlp being treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes which would result in such mlp being required to pay us federal income tax on its taxable income the classification of an mlp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes would also have the effect of reducing the amount of cash available for distribution by the mlp and causing such distributions received by the fund to be taxed as dividend income to the extent of the mlps current or accumulated earnings and profits thus accelerating the recognition of taxable income thus if any of the mlps owned by the fund were treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes the aftertax return to the fund with respect to its investment in such mlps would be materially reduced which could cause a substantial decline in the value of the common shares if the fund invests in the equity securities of an mlp the fund will be a partner in such mlp accordingly the fund will be required to include in its taxable income the funds allocable share of the income gains losses deductions and expenses recognized by each such mlp regardless of whether the mlp distributes cash to the fund historically mlps have been able to offset a significant portion of their income with tax deductions the portion if any of a distribution received by the fund from an mlp that exceeds the funds allocable share of the mlps taxable income is essentially treated as return of capital however any such return of capital will decrease the funds adjusted basis in the equity securities of the mlp which will result in an increase in the amount of gain or decrease in the amount of loss that will be recognized by the fund for tax purposes on the sale of any such equity securities in addition the fund will incur a current income tax liability on its allocable share of the portion of the mlps income that is not offset by the mlps tax deductions the percentage of an mlps income that is offset by the mlps tax deductions will fluctuate over time for example new acquisitions by mlps generate accelerated depreciation and other tax deductions and therefore a decline in acquisition activity by the mlps owned by the fund could increase the funds current tax liability a decline in the percentage of the mlps income that is offset by tax deductions or an increase in the funds portfolio turnover could increase the funds tax liability and reduce the portion of the distributions paid by the fund that is treated as return of capital andor capital gain as the case may be and increase the portion treated as taxable dividend income this generally would result in lower aftertax distributions to shareholders changes in tax laws or regulations or future interpretations of such laws or regulations could adversely affect the fund or the mlp entities in which the fund invests in addition the favorable us federal tax treatment of certain qualified dividends is set to expire for taxable years beginning on or after january   unless further congressional action is taken if no action is taken dividends paid by the fund to certain noncorporate us shareholders including individuals will be fully taxable at ordinary income rates longterm capital gains rates for certain noncorporate us shareholders including individuals are scheduled to increase to  for taxable years beginning after december   deferred tax risk as a limited partner in the mlps the fund includes its allocable share of the mlps taxable income in computing its own taxable income because the fund is treated as a regular corporation or c corporation for us federal income tax purposes the fund will incur tax expenses in calculating the funds net asset value the fund will account for its deferred tax liability andor asset the fund will accrue a deferred income tax liability at an assumed federal state and local income tax rate for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments and the distributions received by the fund on equity securities of mlps considered to be return of capital any deferred tax liability will reduce the funds net asset value upon the sale of an equity security in an mlp the fund generally will be liable for any previously deferred taxes no assurance can be given that such taxes will not exceed the funds deferred tax assumptions for purposes of computing the funds net asset value per share which would result in an immediate reduction of the funds net asset value per share the fund will accrue a deferred tax asset which reflects an estimate of the funds future tax benefit associated with realized and unrealized net operating losses and capital losses any deferred tax asset will increase the funds net asset value to the extent the fund has a deferred tax asset consideration is given as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required which would offset the value of some or all of the deferred tax asset the need to establish a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset is assessed periodically by the fund based on the criterion established by the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  asc  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the assessment for a valuation allowance consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax asset this assessment considers among other matters the nature frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses forecasts of future profitability which are highly dependent on future mlp cash distributions the duration of statutory carryforward periods and the associated risk that operating loss carryforwards may expire unused the funds deferred tax liability andor asset is estimated using estimates of effective tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years such taxes are realized for purposes of estimating the funds deferred tax liability andor asset for financial statement reporting and determining its net asset value the fund will be required to rely to some extent on information provided by the mlps in which it invests such information may not be received in a timely manner with the result that the funds estimates regarding its deferred tax liability andor asset could vary dramatically from the funds actual tax liability and as a result the determination of the funds actual tax liability may have a material impact on the funds net asset value from time to time the fund may modify its estimates or assumptions regarding its deferred tax liability andor asset as new information becomes available modifications of such estimates or assumptions or changes in applicable tax law could result in increases or decreases in the funds net asset value per share which could be material limitations on use of net operating losses in the event that the fund experiences an ownership change for purposes of section  of the code which generally is any change in ownership of more than  of the funds common stock over a threeyear period the funds ability to use net operating loss and capital loss carryovers to offset future taxable income could be substantially limited although the fund does not expect that the offering of common shares pursuant to the funds effective registration statement should cause an ownership change for purposes of section  of the code it is possible that future issuances or sales of common shares or other securities or certain other direct or indirect changes in ownership when combined with this and prior issuances may result in an ownership change affiliated party risk certain mlps in which the fund may invest depend upon their parent or sponsor entities for the majority of their revenues were their parent or sponsor entities to fail to make such payments or satisfy their obligations the revenues and cash flows of such mlps and ability of such mlps to make distributions to unit holders such as the fund would be adversely affected equity securities risk a substantial percentage of the funds assets will be invested in equity securities including mlp common units mlp subordinated units mlp preferred units equity securities of mlp affiliates including ishares and common stocks of other issuers equity risk is the risk that mlp units or other equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market or economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate changes in interest rates and the particular circumstances and performance of particular companies whose securities the fund holds the price of an equity security of an issuer may be particularly sensitive to general movements in the stock market or a drop in the stock market may depress the price of most or all of the equity securities held by the fund in addition mlp units or other equity securities held by the fund may decline in price if the issuer fails to make anticipated distributions or dividend payments because among other reasons the issuer experiences a decline in its financial condition mlp subordinated units typically are convertible to mlp common units at a onetoone ratio the price of mlp subordinated units is typically tied to the price of the corresponding mlp common unit less a discount the size of the discount depends upon a variety of factors including the likelihood of conversion the length of time remaining until conversion and the size of the block of subordinated units being purchased or sold the fund may invest in equity securities issued by mlp affiliates including general partners of mlps such issuers may be organized andor taxed as corporations and therefore may not offer the advantageous tax characteristics of mlp units investments in the mlp affiliates would be expected by the subadviser to provide economic exposure to the mlp asset class however such investments may not exhibit precise price correlation to any particular mlp or the mlp asset class generally ishares represent an indirect investment in mlp iunits prices and volatilities of ishares tend to correlate to the price of common units although the price correlation is not precise ishares differ from mlp common units primarily in that instead of receiving cash distributions holders of ishares will receive distributions of additional ishares in an amount equal to the cash distributions received by common unit holders ishares have limited voting rights holders of ishares are subject to the same risks as holders of mlp common units concentration risk because the fund is focused in mlp entities in the energy natural resources and real estate sectors of the economy the fund may be more susceptible to risks associated with such sectors the fund will concentrate its investments in the industry or group of industries that make up the energy sector a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the fund than on an investment company that does not concentrate in such sector at times the performance of securities of companies in the energy sector may lag the performance of other sectors or the broader market as a whole energy sector risks many mlp entities operate within the energy sector therefore the fund will concentrate its investments in the industry or group of industries that make up the energy sector as a result the fund will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector there are several risks associated with investments in mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector including the following commodity price risk mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector may be affected by fluctuations in the prices of energy commodities including for example natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil and coal in the short and longterm fluctuations in energy commodity prices may be influenced by changes in

local intrastate and interstate transportation methods companies engaged in crude oil and natural gas exploration development or production natural gas gathering and processing crude oil refining and transportation and coal mining or sales may be directly affected by their respective natural resources commodity prices the volatility of commodity prices may also indirectly affect certain companies engaged in the transportation processing storage or distribution of such commodities some companies that own the underlying commodities may be unable to effectively mitigate or manage direct margin exposureto commodity price levels the energy sector as a whole may also be impacted by the perception that the performance of energy sector companies is directly linked to commodity prices supply and demand risk mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector may be impacted by the levels of supply and demand for energy commodities mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector could be adversely affected by reductions in the supply of or demand for energy commodities the volume of production of energy commodities and the volume of energy commodities available for transportation storage processing or distribution could be affected by a variety of factors including depletion of resources depressed commodity prices catastrophic events labor relations increased environmental or other governmental regulation equipment malfunctions and maintenance difficulties import volumes international politics policies of opec and increased competition from alternative energy sources alternatively a decline in demand for energy commodities could result from factors such as adverse economic conditions especially in key energyconsuming countries increased taxation increased environmental or other governmental regulation increased fuel economy increased energy conservation or use of alternative energy sources legislation intended to promote the use of alternative energy sources or increased commodity prices depletion risk mlp entities and other energy companies engaged in the exploration development management or production of energy commodities face the risk that commodity reserves are depleted over time such companies seek to increase their reserves through expansion of their current businesses acquisitions further development of their existing sources of energy commodities exploration of new sources of energy commodities or by entering into longterm contracts for additional reserves however there are risks associated with each of these potential strategies if such companies fail to acquire additional reserves in a costeffective manner and at a rate at least equal to the rate at which their existing reserves decline their financial performance may suffer additionally failure to replenish reserves could reduce the amount and affect the tax characterization of the distributions paid by such companies regulatory risk the energy sector is highly regulated mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations by federal state and local governmental agencies examples of governmental regulations which impact mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector include regulation of the construction maintenance and operation of facilities environmental regulation safety regulation labor regulation trade regulation and the regulation of the prices charged for products and services compliance with these regulations is enforced by numerous governmental agencies and authorities through administrative civil and criminal penalties stricter laws or regulations or stricter enforcement policies with respect to existing regulations would likely increase the costs of regulatory compliance and could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector mlp entities may be adversely affected by additional regulatory requirements enacted in response to environmental disasters which may impose additional costs or limit certain operations by mlps operating in various sectors environmental risk costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle for example an accidental release from wells or gathering pipelines could subject them to substantial liabilities for environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations moreover the possibility exists that stricter laws regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the compliance costs of mlps and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary mlps may not be able to recover these costs from insurance specifically the operations of wells gathering systems pipelines refineries and other facilities are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local environmental laws and regulations these include for example i the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions ii the federal clean water act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to discharges of pollutants into regulated bodies of water iii the federal resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and comparable state laws and regulations that impose requirements for the handling and disposal of waste from facilities and iv the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  “cercla” also known as “superfund” and comparable state laws and regulations that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by mlps or at locations to which they have sent waste for disposal failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes including rcra cercla the federal oil pollution act and analogous state laws and regulations impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed been adopted or are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane the major constituent of natural gas which many scientists and policymakers believe contribute to global climate change these measures and future measures could result in increased costs to certain companies in which the fund may invest to operate and maintain facilities and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program and may reduce demand for fuels that generate greenhouse gases and that are managed or produced by companies in which the fund may invest in the wake of a supreme court decision holding that the environmental protection agency epa has some legal authority to deal with climate change under the clean air act the epa and the department of transportation jointly wrote regulations to cut gasoline use and control greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks these measures and other programs addressing greenhouse gas emissions could reduce demand for energy or raise prices which may adversely affect the total return of certain of the funds investments acquisition risk mlp entities owned by the fund may depend on their ability to make acquisitions that increase adjusted operating surplus per unit in order to increase distributions to unit holders the ability of such mlp entities to make future acquisitions is dependent on their ability to identify suitable targets negotiate favorable purchase contracts obtain acceptable financing and outbid competing potential acquirers to the extent that mlp entities are unable to make future acquisitions or such future acquisitions fail to increase the adjusted operating surplus per unit their growth and ability to make distributions to unit holders will be limited there are risks inherent in any acquisition including erroneous assumptions regarding revenues acquisition expenses operating expenses cost savings and synergies assumption of liabilities indemnification customer losses key employee defections distraction from other business operations and unanticipated difficulties in operating or integrating new product areas and geographic regions interest rate risk rising interest rates could increase the costs of capital thereby increasing operating costs and reducing the ability of mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector to carry out acquisitions or expansions in a costeffective manner as a result rising interest rates could negatively affect the financial performance of mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector in which the fund invests rising interest rates may also impact the price of the securities of mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector as the yields on alternative investments increase weather risk weather plays a role in the seasonality of some mlp entities cash flows mlp entities in the propane industry for example rely on the winter season to generate almost all of their earnings in an unusually warm winter season propane mlp entities experience decreased demand for their product although most mlp entities can reasonably predict seasonal weather demand based on normal weather patterns extreme weather conditions such as the hurricanes that severely damaged cities along the gulf coast in recent years demonstrate that no amount of preparation can protect an mlp entity from the unpredictability of the weather the damage done by extreme weather also may serve to increase many mlp entities insurance premiums catastrophic event risk mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector are subject to many dangers inherent in the production exploration management transportation processing and distribution of natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil refined petroleum and petroleum products and other hydrocarbons these dangers include leaks fires explosions damage to facilities and equipment resulting from natural disasters inadvertent damage to facilities and equipment and terrorist acts since the september th terrorist attacks the us government has issued warnings that energy assets specifically us pipeline infrastructure may be targeted in future terrorist attacks these dangers give rise to risks of substantial losses as a result of loss or destruction of commodity reserves damage to or destruction of property facilities and equipment pollution and environmental damage and personal injury or loss of life any occurrence of such catastrophic events could bring about a limitation suspension or discontinuation of the operations of mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector may not be fully insured against all risks inherent in their business operations and therefore accidents and catastrophic events could adversely affect such companies financial conditions and ability to pay distributions to shareholders legislation risk there have been proposals in congress to eliminate certain tax incentives widely used by oil and gas companies and to impose new fees on certain energy producers the elimination of such tax incentives and imposition of such fees could adversely affect mlp entities and other companies operating in the energy sector in which the fund invests andor the energy sector generally industry specific risks mlp entities and energy companies are also subject to risks that are specific to the industry they serve midstream midstream mlps entities and energy companies that provide crude oil refined product and natural gas services are subject to supply and demand fluctuations in the markets they serve which will be impacted by a wide range of factors including fluctuating commodity prices weather increased conservation or use of alternative fuel sources increased governmental or environmental regulation depletion rising interest rates declines in domestic or foreign production accidents or catastrophic events and economic conditions among others pipeline companies are subject to the demand for natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil or refined products in the markets they serve changes in the availability of products for gathering transportation processing or sale due to natural declines in reserves and production in the supply areas serviced by the companies facilities sharp decreases in crude oil or natural gas prices that cause producers to curtail production or reduce capital spending for exploration activities and environmental regulation demand for gasoline which accounts for a substantial portion of refined product transportation depends on price prevailing economic conditions in the markets served and demographic and seasonal factors companies that own interstate pipelines that transport natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil or refined petroleum products are subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc with respect to the tariff rates they may charge for transportation services an adverse determination by ferc with respect to the tariff rates of such a company could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations and cash flows of those companies and their ability to pay cash distributions or dividends in addition ferc has a tax allowance policy which permits such companies to include in their cost of service an income tax allowance to the extent that their owners have an actual or potential tax liability on the income generated by them if fercs income tax allowance policy were to change in the future to disallow a material portion of the income tax allowance taken by such interstate pipeline companies it would adversely impact the maximum tariff rates that such companies are permitted to charge for their transportation services which would in turn adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows of those companies and their ability to pay cash distributions or dividends to their unit holders or shareholders gathering and processing companies are subject to natural declines in the production of oil and natural gas fields which utilize their gathering and processing facilities as a way to market their production prolonged declines in the price of natural gas or crude oil which curtails drilling activity and therefore production and declines in the prices of natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products which cause lower processing margins in addition some gathering and processing contracts subject the gathering or processing company to direct commodities price risk upstream exploration development and production companies are particularly vulnerable to declines in the demand for and prices of crude oil and natural gas reductions in prices for crude oil and natural gas can cause a given reservoir to become uneconomic for continued production earlier than it would if prices were higher resulting in the plugging and abandonment of and cessation of production from that reservoir in addition lower commodity prices not only reduce revenues but also can result in substantial downward adjustments in reserve estimates the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data the accuracy of assumptions regarding future commodity prices and future exploration and development costs and engineering and geological interpretations and judgments different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data actual oil and gas prices development expenditures and operating expenses will vary from those assumed in reserve estimates and these variances may be significant any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from those estimated in reserve reports in addition results of drilling testing and production and changes in prices after the date of reserve estimates may result in downward revisions to such estimates substantial downward adjustments in reserve estimates could have a material adverse effect on a given exploration and production companys financial position and results of operations in addition due to natural declines in reserves and production exploration and production companies must economically find or acquire and develop additional reserves in order to maintain and grow their revenues and distributions oil and gas production in addition to other risks described herein companies involved in the transportation gathering processing exploration development or production of crude oil natural gas andor refined petroleum products are subject to supply and demand fluctuations in the markets they serve which will be impacted by a wide range of factors including fluctuating commodity prices weather increased conservation or use of alternative fuel sources increased governmental or environmental regulation depletion rising interest rates declines in domestic or foreign production accidents or catastrophic events and economic conditions among others in addition the oil and gas industries may be adversely affected by increased regulations increased operating costs and reductions in the supply of andor demand for crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products as a result of accidents or catastrophic events and the reactions thereto propane propane mlp entities are subject to earnings variability based upon weather conditions in the markets they serve fluctuating commodity prices increased use of alternative fuels increased governmental or environmental regulation and accidents or catastrophic events among others coal mlps entities and energy companies with coal assets are subject to supply and demand fluctuations in the markets they serve which will be impacted by a wide range of factors including fluctuating commodity prices the level of their customers coal stockpiles weather increased conservation or use of alternative fuel sources increased governmental or environmental regulation depletion rising interest rates declines in domestic or foreign production mining accidents or catastrophic events health claims and economic conditions among others they are also subject to supply variability based on geological conditions that reduce the productivity of mining operations the availability of regulatory permits for mining activities and the availability of coal that meets the standards of the clean air act marine transportation marine transportation companies are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the tanker industry and may be subject to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values which may adversely affect the earnings of tanker companies fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in the supply and demand for tanker capacity and changes in the supply and demand for oil and oil products changes in demand for transportation of oil over longer distances and the supply of tankers to carry that oil may materially affect the revenues profitability and cash flows of tanker companies the successful operation of vessels in the charter market depends upon among other things obtaining profitable spot charters and minimizing time spent waiting for charters and traveling unladen to pick up cargo the value of tanker vessels may fluctuate and could adversely affect the value of tanker company securities in the funds portfolio declining tanker values could affect the ability of tanker companies to raise cash by limiting their ability to refinance their vessels thereby adversely impacting tanker company liquidity tanker company vessels are at risk of damage or loss because of events such as mechanical failure collision human error war terrorism piracy cargo loss and bad weather in additionchanging economic regulatory and political conditions in some countries including political and military conflicts have from time to time resulted in attacks on vessels mining of waterways piracy terrorism labor strikes boycotts and government requisitioning of vessels these sorts of events could interfere with shipping lanes and result in market disruptions and a significant loss of tanker company earnings other sector risks the fund also may invest in securities of mlp entities in the natural resources sector and the real estate sector among other sectors which may subject the fund to additional risks associated with investments in those sectors natural resources sector risks the natural resources sector includes companies principally engaged in owning or developing nonenergy natural resources including timber and minerals and industrial materials or supplying goods or services to such companies the funds investments in mlp entities and other companies operating in the natural resources sector will be subject to the risk that prices of these securities may fluctuate widely in response to the level and volatility of commodity prices exchange rates import controls domestic and global competition environmental regulation and liability for environmental damage mandated expenditures for safety or pollution control the success of exploration projects depletion of resources tax policies and other governmental regulation investments in the natural resources sector can be significantly affected by changes in the supply of or demand for various natural resources the value of investments in the natural resources sector may be adversely affected by a change in inflation real estate sector risks the fund may invest in mlp entities or other companies operating in the real estate sector which may develop land own or manage residential commercial and undeveloped properties own mortgage securities and provide financing to owners and developers of multifamily housing or other real estate or building ventures to the extent that the fund invests in securities of mlp entities and other companies operating in the real estate sector the funds performance may be linked to the performance of the real estate markets property values may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from economic legal cultural or technological developments changes in interest rates or inflation may adversely affect the value of investments in the real estate sector other factors such as catastrophic events lack of adequate insurance and environmental issues may contribute to the risks of a real estate investment small capitalization risk the fund may invest in securities of mlp entities and other issuers that have comparatively smaller capitalizations relative to issuers whose securities are included in major benchmark indices which present unique investment risks these companies often have limited product lines markets distribution channels or financial resources and the management of such companies may be dependent upon one or a few key people the market movements of equity securities issued by mlp entities with smaller capitalizations may be more abrupt or erratic than the market movements of equity securities of larger more established companies or the stock market in general historically smaller capitalization companies have sometimes gone through extended periods when they did not perform as well as larger companies in addition equity securities of smaller capitalization companies generally are less liquid than those of larger companies this means that the fund could have greater difficulty selling such securities at the time and price that the fund would like restricted securities risk the fund may invest in unregistered or otherwise restricted securities the term restricted securities refers to securities that are unregistered held by control persons of the issuer or are subject to contractual restrictions on their resale restricted securities are often purchased at a discount from the market price of unrestricted securities of the same issuer reflecting the fact that such securities may not be readily marketable without some time delay such securities are often more difficult to value and the sale of such securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of liquid securities trading on national securities exchanges or in the overthecounter markets contractual restrictions on the resale of securities result from negotiations between the issuer and purchaser of such securities and therefore vary substantially in length and scope to dispose of a restricted security that the fund has a contractual right to sell the fund may first be required to cause the security to be registered a considerable period may elapse between a decision to sell the securities and the time when the fund would be permitted to sell during which time the fund would bear market risks risks associated with an investment in initial public offerings securities purchased in initial public offerings ipos are often subject to the general risks associated with investments in companies with small market capitalizations and typically to a heightened degree securities issued in ipos have no trading history and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods in addition the prices of securities sold in an ipo may be highly volatile at any particular time or from time to time the fund may not be able to invest in ipos or to invest to the extent desired because for example only a small portion if any of the securities being offered in an ipo may be available to the fund in addition under certain market conditions a relatively small number of companies may issue securities in ipos the funds investment performance during periods when it is unable to invest significantly or at all in ipos may be lower than during periods when it is able to do so ipo securities may be volatile and the fund cannot predict whether investments in ipos will be successful risks associated with a private investment in public equity transactions investors in private investment in public equity pipe transactions purchase securities directly from a publicly traded company in a private placement transaction typically at a discount to the market price of the companys common stock because the sale of the securities is not registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act the securities are restricted and cannot be immediately resold by the investors into the public markets until the fund can sell such securities into the public markets its holdings will be less liquid and any sales will need to be made pursuant to an exemption under the securities act cash flow risk the fund expects that a substantial portion of the cash flow it receives will be derived from its investments in equity securities of mlp entities the amount and tax characterization of cash available for distribution by an mlp entity depends upon the amount of cash generated by such entitys operations cash available for distribution by mlp entities will vary widely from quarter to quarter and is affected by various factors affecting the entitys operations in addition to the risks described herein operating costs capital expenditures acquisition costs construction costs exploration costs and borrowing costs may reduce the amount of cash that an mlp entity has available for distribution in a given period distribution risk the fund will seek to maximize the portion of the funds distributions to common shareholders that will consist of return of capital to the extent that the funds cash flow is derived primarily from mlp distributions that consist of return of capital the funds anticipates that a significant portion of the funds distributions to common shareholders will consist of return of capital however to the extent that the funds cash flow is derived from distributions of the funds share of an mlps taxable income or from other amounts that are attributable to taxable income such as income or gain on the sale of portfolio securities or in connection with derivatives transactions the portion of the funds distributions to common shareholders treated as taxable dividend income could be increased in addition if the fund generates current earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes in a particular taxable year a distribution by the fund to its shareholders in that year will be wholly or partially taxable even if the fund has an overall deficit in its accumulated earnings and profits andor net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards that reduce or eliminate corporate income taxes in that taxable year there can be no assurance as to what portion of any future distribution will consist of return of capital as opposed to taxable dividend income for example for the taxable year ended november    of the distributions made by the fund to the holders of common shares constituted taxable dividend income and  constituted return of capital risks associated with options on securities there are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events as the writer of a covered call option the fund forgoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a writer of the option once an option writer has received an exercise notice it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position if trading were suspended in an option purchased by the fund the fund would not be able to close out the option if the fund were unable to close out a covered call option that it had written on a security it would not be able to sell the underlying security unless the option expired without exercise liquidity risk mlp common units and equity securities of mlp affiliates including ishares and other issuers often trade on national securities exchanges including the nyse the amex and the nasdaq however certain securities including those of issuers with smaller capitalizations may trade less frequently the market movements of such securities with limited trading volumes may be more abrupt or erratic as a result of the limited liquidity of such securities the fund could have greater difficulty selling such securities at the time and price that the fund would like and may be limited in its ability to make alternative investments valuation risk market prices generally will be unavailable for some of the funds investments including mlp subordinated units direct ownership of general partner interests and restricted or unregistered securities of certain mlp entities and private companies the value of such securities will be determined by fair valuations determined by the board of trustees or its designee in accordance with procedures governing the valuation of portfolio securities adopted by the board of trustees proper valuation of such securities may require more reliance on the judgment of the sub adviser than for valuation of securities for which an active trading market exists interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities such as preferred and debt securities and certain equity securities will decline in value because of a rise in market interest rates when market interest rates rise the market value of such securities generally will fall the net asset value and market price of the common shares will tend to decline as a result of the funds investment in such securities if market interest rates rise during periods of declining interest rates the issuer of a fixedincome security may exercise its option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in lower yielding securities this is known as call or prepayment risk preferred and debt securities frequently have call features that allow the issuer to repurchase the security prior to its stated maturity an issuer may redeem such a security if the issuer can refinance it at a lower cost due to declining interest rates or an improvement in the credit standing of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates the average life of certain types of securities may be extended because of a lower likelihood of prepayments this may lock in a below market interest rate increase the securitys duration and reduce the value of the security this is known as extension risk in typical interest rate environments prices of fixed income securities with longer maturities generally fluctuate more in response to changes in interest rates than do the prices of fixed income securities with shorter term maturities because the fund may invest a portion of its assets in fixedincome securities without regard to their maturities to the extent the fund invests in fixed income securities with longer maturities the net asset value and market price of the common shares would fluctuate more in response to changes in interest rates than if the fund were to invest such portion of its assets in shorterterm fixed income securities market interest rates for investment grade fixed income securities in which the fund may invest are significantly below historical average rates for such securities interest rates below historical average rates may result in increased risk that these rates will rise in the future which would cause the value of the funds net assets to decline and may increase the degree to which asset values may decline in such events lower grade securities risk the fund may invest in fixedincome securities rated below investment grade that is rated ba or lower by moodys bb or lower by sp comparably rated by another statistical rating organization or if unrated as determined by the subadviser to be of comparable credit quality which are commonly referred to as junk bonds investment in securities of belowinvestment grade quality involves substantial risk of loss securities of below investment grade quality are predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due and therefore involve a greater risk of default or decline in market value due to adverse economic and issuerspecific developments securities of below investment grade quality display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment the market values for debt securities of belowinvestment grade quality tend to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than investment grade debt securities portfolio turnover risk the funds portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year the fund cannot predict its annual portfolio turnover rate with accuracy however under normal market conditions it is not expected to exceed  portfolio turnover rate will not be considered as a limiting factor in the execution of the funds investment decisions high portfolio turnover may result in the funds recognition of gains that will be taxable at the fund level and may increase the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits which will result in a greater portion of distributions to common shareholders being treated as dividends additionally high portfolio turnover results in correspondingly higher brokerage commissions and transaction costs borne by the fund foreign securities investing in securities of foreign companies or foreign governments may involve certain risks not typically associated with investing in domestic companies the prices of foreign securities may be affected by factors not present with securities traded in the us markets including political and economic conditions less stringent regulation and higher volatility as a result many foreign securities may be less liquid and more volatile than us securities dividend and interest income may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes which may adversely affect the net return on such investments the funds investments in securities of foreign issuers may consist of investments in adrs adrs are certificates evidencing ownership of shares of a foreign issuer that are issued by depositary banks and generally trade on an established market in the united states or elsewhere although adrs are alternatives to directly purchasing the underlying foreign securities in their national markets and currencies they continue to be subject to many of the risks associated with investing directly in foreign securities derivatives risk in addition to the risks associated with the covered call option option strategy described above the fund may participate in certain derivative transactions such transactions entail certain execution market liquidity hedging and tax risks participation in the options or futures markets involves investment risks and transaction costs to which the fund would not be subject absent the use of these strategies other than its covered call option writing strategy and put option writing strategy if the sub advisers prediction of movements in the direction of the securities and interest rate markets is inaccurate the consequences to the fund may leave the fund in a worse position than if it had not used such strategies market discount risk the funds common shares have a limited trading history and have traded both at a premium and at a discount in relation to nav the fund cannot predict whether the common shares will trade in the future at a premium or discount to nav the funds common shares have recently traded at a substantial premium to nav per share which may not be sustainable if the common shares are trading at a premium to net asset value at the time you purchase common shares the nav per share of the common shares purchased will be less than the purchase price paid shares of closedend investment companies frequently trade at a discount from nav but in some cases have traded above nav continued development of alternative vehicles for investment in securities of mlp entities may contribute to reducing or eliminating any premium or may result in the common shares trading at a discount the risk of the common shares trading at a discount is a risk separate from the risk of a decline in the funds nav as a result of the funds investment activities the funds nav will be reduced immediately following an offering of the common shares due to the costs of such offering which will be borne entirely by the fund the sale of common shares by the fund or the perception that such sales may occur may have an adverse effect on prices of common shares in the secondary market an increase in the number of common shares available may put downward pressure on the market price for common shares the fund may from time to time seek the consent of holders of common shares to permit the issuance and sale by the fund of common shares at a price below the funds then current nav subject to certain conditions and such sales of common shares at price below nav if any may increase downward pressure on the market price for common shares these sales if any also might make it more difficult for the fund to sell additional common shares in the future at a time and price it deems appropriate whether common shareholder will realize a gain or loss upon the sale of common shares depends upon whether the market value of the common shares at the time of sale is above or below the price the common shareholder paid taking into account transaction costs for the common shares and is not directly dependent upon the funds nav because the market value of the common shares will be determined by factors such as the relative demand for and supply of the shares in the market general market conditions and other factors outside the funds control the fund cannot predict whether the common shares will trade at below or above nav or at below or above the public offering price for the common shares dilution risk the voting power of current common shareholders will be diluted to the extent that current common shareholders do not purchase common shares in any future offerings of common shares or do not purchase sufficient common shares to maintain their percentage interest if the fund is unable to invest the proceeds of such offering as intended the funds per common share distribution may decrease and the fund may not participate in market advances to the same extent as if such proceeds were fully invested as planned if the fund sells common shares at a price below nav pursuant to the consent of holders of common shares shareholders will experience a dilution of the aggregate nav per common share because the sale price will be less than the funds thencurrent nav per common share this dilution will be experienced by all shareholders irrespective of whether they purchase common shares in any such offering see description of capital structure—common shares— issuance of additional common shares other investment companies risk the fund may invest in securities of other open or closedend investment companies including exchangetraded funds as a stockholder in an investment company the fund would bear its ratable share of that investment companys expenses and would remain subject to payment of the funds investment management fees with respect to the assets so invested common shareholders would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the fund invests in other investment companies in addition the securities of other investment companies may also be leveraged and will therefore be subject to the same leverage risks described in this prospectus royalty trust risk royalty trusts are in some respects similar to certain mlps and include risks similar to those mlps including commodity price volatility risk cash flow risk and depletion risk financial leverage risk although the use of financial leverage by the fund may create an opportunity for increased aftertax total return for the common shares it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses if the income and gains earned on securities purchased with financial leverage proceeds are greater than the cost of financial leverage the funds return will be greater than if financial leverage had not been used conversely if the income or gains from the securities purchased with such proceeds does not cover the cost of financial leverage the return to the fund will be less than if financial leverage had not been used financial leverage involves risks and special considerations for shareholders including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value market price and dividends on the common shares than a comparable portfolio without leverage the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and shortterm debt or in the dividend rates on any financial leverage that the fund must pay will reduce the return to the common shareholders and the effect of financial leverage in a declining market which is likely to cause a greater decline in the net asset value of the common shares than if the fund were not leveraged which may result in a greater decline in the market price of the common shares it is also possible that the fund will be required to sell assets possibly at a loss or at a gain which could give rise to corporate level tax in order to redeem or meet payment obligations on any leverage such a sale would reduce the funds net asset value and also make it difficult for the net asset value to recover the fund in its best judgment nevertheless may determine to continue to use financial leverage if it expects that the benefits to the funds shareholders of maintaining the leveraged position will outweigh the current reduced return because the fees received by the adviser and subadviser are based on the managed assets of the fund including the proceeds of any financial leverage the adviser and subadviser have a financial incentive for the fund to utilize financial leverage which may create a conflict of interest between the adviser and the subadviser and the common shareholders there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful during any period during which it is employed recent economic and market event have contributed to severe market volatility and caused severe liquidity strains in the credit markets if dislocations in the credit markets continue the funds leverage costs may increase and there is a risk that the fund may not be able to renew or replace existing leverage on favorable terms or at all if the cost of leverage is no longer favorable or if the fund is otherwise required to reduce its leverage the fund may not be able to maintain distributions on common shares at historical levels and common shareholders will bear any costs associated with selling portfolio securities competition risk since the time of the funds initial public offering a number of alternative vehicles for investment in a portfolio of mlps and their affiliates including other publicly traded investment companies and private funds have emerged in addition recent tax law changes have increased the ability of regulated investment companies or other institutions to invest in mlps these competitive conditions may adversely impact the funds ability to meet its investment objective which in turn could adversely impact its ability to make dividend payments legislation risk at any time after the date of this prospectus legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the assets of the fund or the issuers of such assets changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact on entities in which the fund invests there can be no assurance that future legislation regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on the fund or will not impair the ability of the issuers of the assets held in the fund to achieve their business goals and hence for the fund to achieve its investment objective affiliated transaction restrictions from time to time the fund may control or may be an affiliate each as

company under the investment company act of  as amended the  act and will not elect to be treated as a regulated investment company under the code as a result there are no regulatory requirements under the  act or the code that limit the proportion of the funds assets that may be invested in securities of a single issue accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund there are a limited number of publicly traded mlps the fund will select its investments in mlps from this small pool of issuers together with securities issued by any newly public mlps and will invest in securities of other mlp entities and securities of issuers other than mlp entities consistent with its investment objective and policies an investment in the fund may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified portfolio because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the funds common shares management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in acting as the funds subadviser responsible for management of the funds portfolio securities the subadviser will apply investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the fund but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results market disruption and geopolitical risk continuing us military operations in iraq and afganistan instability in the middle east and terrorist attacks in the united states and around the world have contributed to increased market volatility may have longterm effects on the us and worldwide financial markets and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the united states and worldwide the adviser and subadviser do not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the us and global economies and securities markets global political and economic instability could affect the operations of mlp entities and other companies in the energy and natural resources sectors in unpredictable ways including through disruptions of natural resources supplies and markets and the resulting volatility in commodity prices recent political and military instability in a variety of countries throughout the middle east and north africa has heightened these risks recent market and economic developments global financial markets have experienced periods of unprecedented turmoil the debt and equity capital markets in the united states were negatively impacted by significant writeoffs in the financial services sector relating to subprime mortgages and the repricing of credit risk in the broader market among other things these events along with the deterioration of the housing market the failure of major financial institutions and the concerns that other financial institutions as well as the global financial system were also experiencing severe economic distress materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular these events contributed to severe market volatility and caused severe liquidity strains in the credit markets volatile financial markets can expose the fund to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing portfolio instruments held by the fund recently markets have witnessed more stabilized economic activity as expectations for an economic recovery increased however risks to a robust resumption of growth persist however risks to a robust resumption of growth persist several european union eu countries including greece ireland italy spain and portugal have begun to face budget issues some of which may have negative long term effects for the economies of those countries and other eu countries there is continued concern about nationallevel support for the euro and the accompanying coordination of fiscal and wage policy among european economic and monetary union member countries a return to unfavorable economic conditions or sustained economic slowdown may place downward pressure on oil and natural gas prices and may adversely affect the ability of mlps to sustain their historical distribution levels which in turn may adversely affect the fund mlps that have historically relied heavily on outside capital to fund their growth have been impacted by the contraction in the capital markets the continued recovery of the mlp sector is dependent on several factors including the recovery of the financial sector the general economy and the commodity markets the current financial market situation as well as various social political and psychological tensions in the united states and around the world may continue to contribute to increased market volatility may have longterm effects on the us and worldwide financial markets and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the united states and worldwide the prolonged continuation or further deterioration of the current us and global economic downturn could adversely impact the funds portfolio neither the adviser nor the subadviser knows how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the us economy and securities markets in the funds portfolio the adviser and the subadviser intend to monitor developments and seek to manage the funds portfolio in a manner consistent with achieving the funds investment objective but there can be no assurance that they will be successful in doing so given the risks described above an investment in common shares may not be appropriate for all prospective investors a prospective investor should carefully consider his or her ability to assume these risks before making an investment in the fund legal and regulatory risks government intervention the instability in the financial markets discussed above has led the us government to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and in some cases a lack of liquidity federal state and other governments their regulatory agencies or self regulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the fund invests or the issuers of such instruments governments or their agencies may also acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions the longterm implications of government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear and may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity valuation and performance of the funds portfolio holdings the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act which was signed into law in july  has resulted in significant revisions to the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act covers a broad range of topics including among many others a reorganization of federal financial regulators a process designed to ensure financial system stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms new rules for derivatives trading the creation of a consumer financial protection watchdog the registration and regulation of managers of private funds the regulation of credit rating agencies and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans the regulation of various types of derivative instruments pursuant to the doddfrank act may adversely affect mlps and other issuers in which the fund invests that utilize derivatives strategies for hedging or other purposes the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and resulting regulation is not yet certain and issuers in which the fund invests may also be affected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable in connection with an ongoing review by the sec and its staff of the regulation of investment companies use of derivatives on august   the sec issued a concept release to seek public comment on a wide range of issues raised by the use of derivatives by investment companies the sec noted that it intends to consider the comments to help determine whether regulatory initiatives or guidance are needed to improve the current regulatory regime for investment companies and if so the nature of any such initiatives or guidance while the nature of any such regulations is uncertain at this time it is possible that such regulations could limit the implementation of the funds use of derivatives which could have an adverse impact on the fund neither the adviser nor the subadviser can predict the effects of these regulations on the funds portfolio the adviser and the subadviser intend to monitor developments and seek to manage the funds portfolio in a manner consistent with achieving the funds investment objective but there can be no assurance that they will be successful in doing so on february   the us commodity futures trading commission cftc adopted amendments to its rules that once effective may affect the ability of the adviser to continue to claim an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act cea with respect to the fund in order to claim the exclusion the fund would be limited in its ability to use futures or options on futures or engage in swaps transactions if the fund did not continue to claim the exclusion the adviser andor subadviser would become subject to registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator with respect to the fund which would subject the fund to additional registration and regulatory requirements and increased operating expenses certain rules related to these amendments have not yet been finalized or proposed and as a result the impact of the rule changes on the operations of the fund and the adviser and subadviser is not fully known at this time certain lawmakers support an increase in federal revenue as a component of a plan to address the growing federal budget deficit also comprehensive federal tax reform is the subject of political attention there can be no assurance that any change in federal tax law will not adversely affect mlps and other issuers in which the fund invests or the fund itself at any time after the date of this prospectus legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the assets of the fund legislation or regulation may change the way in which the fund itself is regulated the adviser and the subadviser cannot predict the effects of any new governmental regulation that may be implemented and there can be no assurance that any new governmental regulation will not adversely affect the funds ability to achieve its investment objective subscribe to our perspectives your browser does not support iframes your browser
