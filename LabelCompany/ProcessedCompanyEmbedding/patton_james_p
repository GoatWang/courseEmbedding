the turn lane a story of personal and corporate turnarounds and the principles that make them happen september   rob phillipsi first heard jim pattons amazing life story over lunch one day when i was just getting to know this man from my sunday school class i was captivated by how this softspoken and unassuming man had gone — almost literally — from rags to riches as a selftaught entrepreneur who learned the cutthroat mergers and acquisitions game by reading the wall st journal and venturing into his first deal which went badly by the way learning from his mistakes and truly seeking gods direction for his life patton became a successful leader in buying distressed manufacturers and turning them around his business ups and downs parallel his spiritual life this is no nameitandclaimit prosperity gospel it is instead a refreshingly honest account of one mans personal journey from which he shares rare insights into successful business and spiritual walks patton is the real thing there is nothing pretentious about him he doesnt take himself too seriously he quickly admits his shortcomings and credits others with playing key roles in his success and he lives the way most of us can only pretend to live — declaring that god owns all of him and all that he has ultimately his life story — and the patton principles imbedded in it — will help readers see how god works through success and failure to shape a truly amazing lifeinitial post sept    pm pdt zhengrong lii went to mr jim pattons beautiful home in brentwood this late afternoon for his new books signing i finished

excerpt turn little thinking into big ideas   turning around fortune owned companiesif you terminate your contract with bellsouth we will follow you wherever you go and to any other career you pursue you can count on bellsouth being there to ruin youmaybe this is going to be more difficult than i thoughtup until wright  lopez president rick boyle and i walked into the bellsouth operations office in birmingham alabama that monday morning no one had ever terminated a contract with one of the ma bellsthe general manager of bellsouths birmingham operations was dead serious not only did he mean to carry out his threat but i knew he had the title and the muscle to back it up maybe i was in over my head after all who was i to be the first service provider ever to quit on a bellsouth contract every bellsouth manager in the room offered his or her own version of an unfriendly smirk while rick and i slowly went pale the gm was adamant he was not about to allow our company to leave bellsouth in the lurch at the time neither rick nor i fully understood what kind of disaster our withdrawal would cause bellsouth but we were about to find out he and i planned to meet with bellsouth executives in all the markets where wright  lopez had contracts with the telecommunications company birmingham our first stop was a major regional operations center for bellsouth in the early ninetiesthe corporation mike and i formed completed the acquisition of wright  lopez on a friday and the following monday rick and i were on center stage in the birmingham conference room more than a dozen executives were waiting for us when we walked in rick knew most of them so the only introductions were of the top regional bellsouth officers and me as we sat around a large conference table the meeting was formal with no friendly smiles from either sideas all eyes turned to me i showed the bellsouth executives our exit clause and told them in eightynine days we would pull out more than one hundred fifty employees all their related equipment and our aroundtheclock support which was available  days a year you could hear a pin drop even though it wasnt a sprint meeting in a whisper that became vicious as his volume increased the bellsouth gm made his spiteful threat to ruin me if i attempted to withdrawlet me be clear i replied we will be gone in ninety days because were not making money here rick and i had arranged this meeting under the auspices of introducing me as one of the two new owners but my real purpose was to point out the explicit language in our contract that allowed us to give ninety days notice if we wanted to terminate the relationship prior to purchasing wright  lopez i learned that bellsouths corporate and regional offices knew wright  lopez was losing a great deal of money every month because of the new contract which had been signed a year prior to my involvementpleas from wright  lopez to bellsouth for relief from the ridiculously low prices in the contract  which should never have been submitted  fell on deaf ears while wright  lopez won these contracts through competitive bidding everyone at bellsouth knew the company was dripping in red ink but wright  lopez appeared to be trappedas far as bellsouth was concerned there was no way out like it or not wright  lopez had to perform for the next three years of the contract bellsouth was such a large customer that to do otherwise would have been suicide for wright  lopez and the telecommunications management knew it in fact they seemed all too happy about itfrom the standpoint of our original acquisition strategy the ninetyday deadline to cut losses was an absolute necessity ricks management team immediately made appointments with each bellsouth customer located in five different cities each held the same basic contract as birmingham bellsouth was by far our largest customer and with those contracts we simply had to stop the bleeding if we didnt from the ninetyfirst day going forward each day of losses would be coming out of mikes and my pocketsthe other bellsouth operations with which we had contracts were instructed to let the birmingham office handle termination issues related to wright  lopez but we continued visiting the other regional bellsouth offices delivering the identical message although every one of them thought i was bluffing i assured them they were dead wrong and shouldnt underestimate our commitment to exercise the option to withdraw yet no matter how strongly we stated our intentions nothing seemed to faze them early in the process of acquiring wright  lopez i believed i could make two million dollars there were many variables  among them getting bellsouth to agree to a price increase  but in the worstcase scenario if everything fell apart with the customer and employee base i calculated that liquidation would net at least one and a half million i had checked my math too many times to be wrong which is what gave me the confidence to hold firm in my chess match with bellsouth patton principle  have a good fallback position so falling back wont hurtmake plans to win no matter what when your worstcase scenario still paints a profitable picture you can move ahead confidently regardless of the downsidepayroll for wright  lopezs three hundred employees was almost five hundred thousand dollars every two weeks the first week under mikes and my ownership we discovered we were liable for an additional payroll period we had not anticipated fortunately i was able to get triarc to cover the payroll funds amazed at gods continued blessings and provision our deal was structured so that triarc would provide the first ninety days of working capital since we all recognized the losses could not be stopped immediately like a large cruise ship it takes time to turn to the left or rightafter the acquisition transaction was complete eric marveled and told me this is the first deal ive witnessed where we sold a business and instead of getting a check we wrote a checki anticipated that most if not all of the wright  lopez contracts would not be renewed so from day one i began shrinking the company by selling off warehoused equipment and terminating employees who didnt have work assignments lasting more than two weeks outabout thirty days after our meeting in birmingham we received a call from bellsouths vice president of operations inquiring about our manpower allocation plans for the next six months for the birmingham area rick happened to be in my office when the call came through and he took the call there i stood nearby while rick whispered miniupdates as the conversation progressed rick informed the man that we had less than sixty days left on our contract and all our people and equipment would be leaving birmingham exactly as i had explained to the management team a month agoi scribbled a note to rick telling him to ask didnt you guys take patton seriously when he gave written notice of termination the response was a short no and the call ended a few seconds later rick and i really couldnt believe our ears as we continued the laborious process of extracting wright  lopez from birminghambellsouth continued to call as the deadline grew closer during one conversation rick learned that bellsouth did not have other contractors in place to take over our work the other locations faced a similar deadlineeighty days into the notice rick received a call that floored him  bellsouth wanted to meet with us again in birmingham to discuss renegotiations for all bellrelated contracts with wright  lopez five days later rick and i sat in the same large conference room where we met eightyseven days earlier this time the group was much smaller with just a handful of decisionmakers in attendance rick had his computer open and plugged into the companys network to give him internet access he busied himself pretending not to be nervous but in truth we were both on edge as the meeting started their concerns about us walking off the jobs in six states became obvious my nerves calmed down immediately as i realized rick and i had the upper hand in a big way in preparation for this meeting rick and i had reviewed the current pricing on more than fifteen hundred line items this itemized structure allowed bellsouth to have us perform tasks with both sides having a predetermined price in place the problem with the pricing though was that wright  lopez simply couldnt do the work that cheaply and stay in business while the contract was a bad business decision by the former owners mike and i were not going to get stuck with it and lose our shirts our management team calculated we needed a  percent increase across the board for wright  lopez to retain all its employees and become profitablei wasnt listening as the bellsouth gm began with conciliatory remarks about the improvement he had seen recently in our responsiveness and quality of work instead i was mentally rehearsing the speech i was about to give we were losing three hundred thousand dollars a month in birmingham which soured me to the point where just being in the city made illwhen the general manager finished i began i would like everyone in this room to know i dont drive through birmingham anymore in fact i only fly over it and i still get nauseated at thirtyfive thousand feetas the room grew deathly quiet i realized i had their undivided attention and for the first time in my life i felt what real authority meant in the business worldplease listen and listen well i said looking directly at the man who previously threatened to follow me from this industry to the next if i withdrew from the bellsouth contract prior to its completionwright  lopez is withdrawing from birmingham in less than seventytwo hours we have already given notice to have the water and electricity turned off in our offices in three days why on earth wouldnt you believe i would do itwe dont want you to leave one of the executives interrupted we obviously underestimated your resolvewe anticipated you might say that because who else is going to do this work for you rick and i were holding aces in a poker game with bellsouths senior management let me stop right now and ask you a question because this has been bothering me ever since i bought the company and saw all these losses i turned to the gm were you involved in the selection of the contractors to do this workyesat the time did you realize the other contractors bids were much higheryesso you knew wright  lopez was going to get killed on this deal yes he said with a sarcastic chuckle i knew iti wanted to wipe that mocking smirk off his face with a left hook and in my anger i made a snap decision that would have dramatic unintended consequencesthe revised proposal we have here for you which was put together after many days of careful analysis is not complete i said with as much cool as i could muster you need to take these prices and double them across the boardthe response was swift and in rapidfire successionyou have got to be kidding that is ridiculous and extremely insultingyoure out of your mind thats totally irresponsiblehow in the world could you ever think that would workdespite the barrage i was not the least bit fazedit will take a  percent increase to make enough to stay i said with the confidence of someone who has nothing to loserick couldnt hide the shock on his face at my boldness what are you doing he mouthed to me across the tablethe bellsouth executives asked to excuse themselves with copies of our revised proposal in hand about thirty minutes later they returned to the conference roomwe realize there has been some bad blood between us the gm acknowledged normally under these circumstances we would require a rebid but we know youre not going to stay in business for ninety days without an increase under the circumstances we would like to end things right here we will give you a  percent increase after acting like we were out of our minds to expect it bellsouths birmingham office had agreed to a new threeyear contract with a  percent increase for every line item in that one moment we went from losing three hundred thousand dollars a month in birmingham to making a quarter of a million a monthinstead of earning one and a half million dollars to liquidate wright  lopezs assets i suddenly had to shift gears and make plans to run the company for at least three years under a new pricing structure in which i could potentially make eight million dollarsrick excused himself went down the hall to use a phone and called wright  lopezs birmingham office dont fire anyone he said excitedly were getting ready to rock and rollas the last bellsouth employee exited the elevator and the doors closed rick let out the loudest yahoo id ever heard him utter neither of us could believe what had just happened and we excitedly recalled the details as we made our way to the parking level as the bellsouth building grew smaller in the rearview mirror rick and i began to lay out a plan for reviving wright  lopezpatton principle  when youre well armed
