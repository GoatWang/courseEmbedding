to set sending priority of all configmgr driver packages with powershell → winproduct is evil february    comments this is an encore presentation from my old blog i’m a bit of a fan of windows management instrumentation wmi but today’s post is a bit of a ‘buyer beware’  i’ll sum it up and then provide some detail and give you some ideas of where this can be a very bad thing for starters go to a test system windows server 3 windows vista or later launch a powershell command prompt run as administrator so that you have full rights and run the following command getwmiobject winproduct powershell is used for simplicity here – this issue occurs in every way you query winproduct  winproduct will return some great information about each windows installerbased application  in fact you can even view additional properties by running getwmiobject winproduct  select   however even though you called a basic query of the winproduct class you actually performed a consistency check of each installation take a look at the application log after running the previous command  event viewer and you will see something similar to this eventid   source  msiinstaller details  “windows installer reconfigured the product… ” each of these entries is for a windows installer product and you can see in the details that each product was ‘reconfigured’ – luckily if you have healthy windows installers everything should be happy and the consistency check just confirms that if however you have systems that are unhealthy or the installation has been altered in some way this could cause a failure during the consistency check or a failure of the application after the reconfigure the bottom line is that i expect when i query a wmi namespace that only a query occurs unfortunately with winproduct that’s not the case here’s a kb article for vista and server  that explains a scenario with using winproduct as a wmi filter in group policy – the same info applies when querying winproduct manually or with an enterprise systems management tool event log message indicates that the windows installer reconfigured all installed applications httpsupportmicrosoftcomkb9 the article only applies to vista and server  but i can confirm that the same thing happens on server  r and windows  now that we’ve talked about the general issue let’s talk about where things can go bad with using winproduct in configmgr winproduct use potential issues system center update publisher scup using winproduct in an applicability rule will cause every system in your site regardless of collection membership to run the query which causes the consistency checkrepair you can’t control this on a collection level all clients that are configured to the software update point will perform the scan this custom update automatically replicates to all children sites with software update points  each time a scan is run the windows installer consistency checkrepair will run desired configuration management creating a configuration item ci with winproduct will cause every system that is targeted with the ci to initiate the consistency checkrepair each time the baseline rule is evaluated smsdefmof hardware inventory untested but i believe the consistency checkrepair will occur each time hardware inventory runs for all clients in the site configmgr   appmodel deployment types if deploying to users the consistency checkrepair will occur when a user attempts to install the software from the software catalog if deploying to devices i the consistency checkrepair will occur when the client checks to verify that software is installed so as you can see in the configmgr world there are many ways to use winproduct that can cause you to have a bad day so be careful with winproduct the good news is that so far the message reported is benign and it doesn’t seem to actually cause a repair if you encounter a product where this does cause a repair please send me the info asap greg

cr  i like a fool decided to try this before i read further about what about getwmiobject winproduct was evil… i’m a fan of wmi also which goes to show how evil it is – a query forces a consistency check which possibly changes the install wow – that is evil what have i done reply leave a reply cancel reply enter your comment here fill in your details below or click an icon to log in email
