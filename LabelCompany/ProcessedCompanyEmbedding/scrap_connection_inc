kind ondemand ultrasound service more investors more investors details expand all why did you start scrap connection to fix some big problemsour founder chris yerbey has been in the scrap business for over  years he started out brokering and later traded internationally over the years he and his partner built up a very successful business but as revenue increased so did their exposure to financial risks fraud contract cancellations and losses in settlement of quality claims plague every honest buyer seller and broker of scrap materials with experience in platform based technology gained from his previous startup he had a unique crossindustry perspective on how to solve the very problems he was experiencing as a trader motivated to use his knowledge to help others avoid these types of losses chris founded scrap connection in  why should i invest two reasons financial because you agree that scrap connections solutions can provide massive financial value to the industry and that we have the team knowledge and vision to make it happen you expect a sound return on investment because of this personalbecause youre sick of dodgy characters taking advantage of honest people its time to change the scrap industry for the better and you want to help scrap connection achieve that if youre in the industry you want to trade without risk our team has years of experience dealing with the problems we are now building products to solve and also with building technology platforms to solve problems in a traditional industry we are trying to solve a big problem that could potentially create enormous value for a huge market if we are successful our investors could see returns of x – x in a few years whats new about what youre making how is it different put simply were a first mover services for scrap trading exist online but none with the scope or approach were aiming for we see the potential to provide massive value through the reduction of risk quality claims contract cancellations and workflow inefficiencies much of the scrap business operates in a quite oldfashioned low tech way but we believe the sheer value of our services gives a strong incentive for businesses to take advantage of the solutions were creating how do you make money through a low monthly membership fee currently our strategy in the short term is to keep the barrier to entry as low as possible in order to grow the membership base thereby increasing the value of the network in the near future we will implement new features accessible on a payperuse basis for example we intend to earn money from company reports containing indepth information on new and existing trading partners which members would typically download before booking a new order or when doing market research other features will include the ability to book low cost shipping and financial products such as escrow payments already in place foreign exchange lc finance and insurance how big can you be we aim to have  billion of the annual global scrap trade being conducted on our platform by  as we offer more and more payperuse services centered around trades we calculate that our revenue as a percentage of transactions will reach  or  million per year using pe ratios for technology companies the estimated value of our company at this level would be more than  million but  billion of trade is less than  of the  billion scrap market upon reaching that milestone we would pursue a  share of the market and more this would push the value of our company above the  billion mark i dont know anything about scrap can you explain it for me sure thing the waste management industry is one of the biggest industries that you never think about around us billion of scrap is traded globally every year including metals paper plastics glass rubber etc scrap could actually a bad word for it because its not rubbish at all for example  of all steel is recycled youve probably seen your local scrap yard stacked with old cars but thats not the only place scrap comes from other sources include the demolition of buildings and equipment offcutswaste from industrial processes and municipal waste collection services who buys the scrap well depending on the material the country and what the market is doing roughly twothirds of scrap is bought  sold domestically the remainder is shipped in containers or in bulk overseas its bought by industrial mills who melt the scrap down remove any impurities and shape it into new products to be sold what problems are you actually solving despite being an old industry theres a lot of room for incurring loss in the scrap industry we estimate these losses cost companies over  million a year here are the main causes which were aiming to solve material quality claims claims happen and for good reason sometimes the material the buyer receives just isnt what they thought they were buying maybe its poorer quality than expected maybe its gone rusty over the journey because it was wet when it was loaded into the shipping container it could be in different size pieces and therefore requires further treatment before processing theres a myriad of reasons not all of them scrupulous and a lot of them can be solved by better communication and documentation so expectations are managed fraudsometimes you need to buy from a new source the source might seem legit but when your shipment arrives it might be full of very low quality material or perhaps include no material at all we aim to drastically reduce the chance of that happening with our verification and business intelligence tools contract cancellationthe price of scrap changes every day sometimes it changes so much that the financial benefit of backing out of a deal appears to outweigh the cost of losing a trading partner and having them tell everyone they know not to do business with you we plan to track deals as they happen so that we can reward honest players and flag dodgy dealers for everybody to see material quality and claimsrecyclable raw materials are typically waste products that have been processed in order to remove impurities that can cause problems in the process of making new materials like steel aluminium and plastics these materials can be handled multiple times between the point of creation demolition of a building shredding of a car trimming plastic parts etc and the point of use at each stage material quality can be improved or worsened often unintentionally at the end of the supply chain the buyer of the material is stuck with it for better or for worse because they already paid for it when quality is less than expected the buyer will file a claim for a partial refund in the end the buyer wants a fair settlement and the supplier wants to be sure the claim is genuine we aim to improve this claims process by first ensuring that both parties remain accountable for a fair resolution we will provide inspection services and technology tools which reduce miscommunications regarding quality while keeping all of the conversations documentation and photos surrounding a transaction in one place for both parties to easily review when a rapid solution cannot be found we can forward the details about the entire transaction to an arbitration firm to help both parties reach a mediated settlement fragmented servicesthere are a multitude of financial transport and documentation services needed when trading in scrap especially internationally some of these are accessible online but not efficiently we see that bringing all the services together onto one platform can dramatically streamline workflows isnt the scrap business a bit dodgy our services are focussed on industrialscale bb trade shady characters stealing copper wiring in the dead of the night to sell to their local scrap yard certainly exist but thats not who uses our services we connect scrap yards waste companies traders and brokers with industrial mills who buy the scrap to melt it down into new finished and semifinished products like steel that said theres still a lack of oversight and accountability in the industry which leads to problems in itself and which we aim to solve how do you acquire customers at the moment through wordofmouth and campaigns on social media platforms that we focus towards industry groups this has provided us with steady growth until now but as we look to scale even more well be adding dedicated sales hustlers to our team in the near future whats your biggest risk what keeps you up at night honestly its how to convince everyone in the scrap industry that the minor shortterm pain of slightly changing how they work is worth the major longterm financial gains delivered through vastly reducing their exposure to risk quality claims and contract cancellations its a good thing were passionate and believe in our solutions are you just in metals what about other verticals our experience is with the metals market so were starting with what we know once were happy with the product however we see no reason why it cant be expanded to other recyclables and any other commodity traded in a spot marketweve already opened up our platform to plastic and escrap recyclers essentially we see our product being useful to any company that trades in industrial raw materials who are your competitors how are you different there are a number of companies already offering company info and buysell listing services online specific to the scrap industry the problems in the industry arent just solved by simply bringing everyone online however in fact theyre probably compounded our difference is our focus on verification accountability and hard data to give our customers real insight into which companies they should be dealing with how will you scale our platform is designed to scale by its very nature our customers are incentivised to invite their contacts because the more contacts a company has on scrap connection the more value they receive therefore our current users are our most important asset for scaling what is crowdfunding there are two types of crowdfunding rewardsbased crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding were using equity crowdfunding rewardsbased crowdfunding like on kickstarter and indiegogo is where you give a company money to produce a product you believe in and in return the company might give you a reward such as a copy of the product or public recognition but if the company goes on to make millions you dont get any of the profits this is why were using equity crowdfunding we want our investors to profit themselves equity crowdfunding is the process where people ie the ‘crowd’ invest in an earlystage unlisted company a company that is not listed on a stock market like scrap connection in exchange for shares in that company a shareholder has partial ownership of a company and stands to profit should the company do well unlike traditional investing each

started would be worth k today these are just a couple of examples of young companies that were acquired for hundreds of millions even billions of dollars making their earliest investors fantastically rich however examples like google and tumblr are extremely rare and only  in  startups provide a significant return for their investors out of every  startups  startups fail go bankrupt or the business closes startups are worse than average aren’t very profitable and return less than the invested capital but are still active startups are a moderate success are profitable and return just the invested capital they are not acquired yet and are still active highly successful startup will pay the investor a multiple return on his investment that startup has an ipo or is the target of a

ask a question risks specific to scrap connection  the following trends or uncertainties could affect our financial condition including the liquidity cash flow and capital resources described belowthe company’s operations may be unprofitable and may result in the total loss of investment  while the company believes in good faith that its business plans have a reasonable chance of success the operation of the company are ultimately speculative and involve the possibility of a total loss of investment due to any number of considerations investment is suitable only for individuals who are financially able to withstand total loss of their investment  the success of the company is highly dependent upon the ability of its ceo and management team to attract and retain qualified managers and other personnel in a competitive environment  growth of the company will require the recruitment retention and integration of additional highly qualified individuals even if such people can be hired the projected growth in staff could present further management risks the market for qualified personnel is highly competitive and there can be no assurance that any critical positions can be filled on a timely basis  the company’s revenue model may be impaired or change the company’s success depends mainly on its ability to receive revenue as earnings from the company’s software as a service platform the company may generate but retain some or all of the earnings for growth and development of its business and accordingly not make distributions to the shareholders if the company does not generate revenue its business financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected  the company intends to use a significant portion of the proceeds from the offering for unspecified working capital the offering proceeds will be used by the company in the ways management deems most effective towards the company’s goals this means that although we

may have no recourse a use of proceeds that does not further the company’s business and goals could harm the company and its operations and ultimately cause an investor to lose all or portion of his or her investment  from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of the company’s products infringe their intellectual property rights  the company has received no notices or indications otherwise and believes they have not infringed on anyone else’s ip rights that said the company’s technologydriven business is highly dependent on the company’s intellectual property while the company believes in good faith that it has robust rights to all intellectual property needed for its business any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming due to the uncertainty of the intellectual property litigation and could divert the company’s management and key personnel from its business operation a claim of intellectual property infringement could force the company to enter into costly or restrictive license agreement which may not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require the company to redesign or relabel its products which would be costly and time consuming andor could subject the company to an injunction against sale of certain of its products the company may have to pay substantial damages including damages for the past infringement if it is ultimately determined that its products infringe a third party’s proprietary rights  the company has a small team and the loss of key team members and especially the loss or death of the founder chris yerbey could harm the company’s ability to implement their plans  the company could be harmed in the event of the death or disability of founder chris yerbey likewise key

might sell enough securities in this offering to meet its operating needs and fulfill its plans in which case the company might need to reduce sales  marketing engineering or other expenses were recurring revenue to decrease further cuts would be needed and hurt the company’s ability to meet its goals even if the company raises the entire round successfully we may need to raise more capital in the future in order to continue even if we do make successful offerings in the future the terms of that offering might result in your investment in the company being worth less because of the terms of future investment rounds  the company may not be profitable nor be sold for an amount able to recoup this investment  the market for technology companies is not predictable while we may be able to sell the company for its technology client relationships team or other factors there is no guarantee that it can be sold nor that it will become profitable nor that it will reach an initial public offering ipo even if those do occur there is no guarantee that investor returns will be positive  the company’s securities may not be marketable  even if the company is successful an investor may want immediate access to the then net worth of the investment but selling private securities can be difficult or impossible in this case an investor may need to wait until a liquidity event and there are
