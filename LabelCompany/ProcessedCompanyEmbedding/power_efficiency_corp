efficiency corp announces successful escalator tests at stratosphere casino hotel and energy managementvendor news power efficiency corp announces successful escalator tests at stratosphere casino hotel and tower by glenn hasek  june     share facebook twitter las vegas—power efficiency corp a developer and manufacturer of advanced energy savings technologies for electric motors announced that it completed successful tests on two escalators at the stratosphere casino hotel and tower one of the most recognizable properties on the las vegas strip the stratosphere casino hotel and tower is part of the american casino  entertainment properties family of casinos “our products performed very successfully in these tests the latest of four tests we’ve recently announced” says steven strasser power efficiency’s chairman and ceo “energy is a core national and environmental concern with energy prices constantly rising we believe energy saving technologies such as our company’s product the power genius will be extremely valuable in the marketplace “electric motors consume almost one quarter of the electricity produced in the united states many of these motors are candidates for our technology as these recent tests have shown our patented technology is effective at consistently saving  percent or more of the energy used on escalators the technology also has applications on many types of industrial equipment such as granulators mixers grinders stamping presses crushers and more” american casino  entertainment properties along with its subsidiaries and affiliate companies owns and operates five casinos in nevada and new jersey including arizona charlie’s decatur and boulder the flamingo laughlin and sands atlantic city the specific parameters and results of the test include • two escalators each with  horsepower electric motors operating virtually nonstop  hours a day  days a week • the “up” escalator showed  percent energy savings resulting in projections of over  kilowatt hours in savings per year • the “down” escalator showed  percent energy savings resulting in projections of over  kilowatt hours in savings per year for more information visit power
