philadelphia and delaware countiesjuly  flood trucks lead to denaples probe matt birkbeckof the morning call trucker richard rothstein thought hed found a bargainrothstein bought a freightliner columbia tractor in december  for  from denaples auto sales in dunmore lackawanna county the truck which typically sold for  or more had come from new orleans where it was parked when hurricane katrina devastated the city in august it was one of  bought with a check signed by louis denaples the controversial owner of mount airy casino resortrothstein says he was told by dunmore repair which handled the sale for denaples auto sales that floodwaters reached only halfway up the tires and that the vehicle had not been damaged by the storm the truck came with a full warranty and a clean title the odometer read  miles it was spotless and looked like it was in great condition rothstein the owner of rothys inc near scranton said in a recent interviewbut three months after rothstein bought the truck its engine caught fire and when rothstein brought the rig in for repairs he learned that his truck and the  others had been submerged during katrina and sold as salvage to denaples auto sales for  each by leaseplan usa of georgia pennsylvania state police acting on a referral from the fbi began investigating the case early last year as possible title washing of the hurricane katrina trucks which were purchased with a  denaples auto sales check according to ralph periandi a former deputy commissioner for the state police a law enforcement source said the investigation remains opentitle washing a felony offense entails dealers buying flooddamaged vehicles cleaning them and selling them in different states without disclosing the damage on the vehicles title as required by law state police spokesman jack lewis and spokeswoman cpl lynette quinn did not return calls for comment on the katrinarelated probethirty years ago denaples pleaded no contest to defrauding the federal government of more than  for cleanup work associated with another natural disaster hurricane agnesdenaples currently faces four perjury counts for allegedly lying to pennsylvania gaming regulators to obtain a slots license for mount airy in monroe county denaples has proclaimed his innocencethe pennsylvania gaming control board after learning about denaples involvement with rothstein and the katrina trucks from its investigators referred the matter to the department of state which licenses auto dealers the department concluded there was no fraud in the titling of the trucks the board then awarded denaples a slots license in december the trucks were one of several issues involving denaples brought before the board before its vote among them allegations of ties to organized crime the boards duty was to determine whether denaples was suitable to hold a slots license as per state gaming lawtad decker the former gaming board chairman said the board looked thoroughly at the katrina truck matter we had suspicions it might be something decker said but it turned out not to be an issuea denaples spokesman kevin feeley said a considerable amount of evidence was presented to the gaming board and they concluded correctly that there is no basis for any claim that these trucks were bought or sold in any improper way or titled in any improper wayfeeley also insisted that the trucks were not salvage vehicles no matter what is saidthe trucks were leased by air products and chemicals of trexlertown and they were parked at an air products facility in new orleans when katrina struck the trucks were submerged in the subsequent flooding that devastated new orleans so the leasing company leaseplan usa asked air products to help find someone to buy them as salvagewe have a fleet of trucks and we know people out there who are interested in buying damaged trucks and we contacted them our sales documents clearly identified the trucks as being waterdamaged said art george an air products spokesmanone of those contacted was louis denaples who offered  for the trucks said george astraukas a leaseplan usa vice president denaples first wrote a check from keystone landfill inc which denaples owns but that check was rejected because it had to come from a licensed auto dealer said astraukas so denaples issued and signed a check from denaples auto salesafter buying the trucks denaples was required to report them to the pennsylvania department of transportation as waterdamaged astraukas said penndot brands such vehicles with a w on state titles the title on rothsteins truck obtained by the morning call shows no such wwe thought he would sell them as salvage said astraukas confirming that all  trucks had been under water but he didnt apparentlythe truck drove beautifully the first few months rothstein said but after rothstein developed a cough he hired a driver to cover him while he traveled to florida to convalescei planned to take a month off he said but then i got a call that the truck caught fire and came backrothstein said he took the truck to a repair shop and was told the full warranty given by dunmore repair had been voided long before he bought the vehicle air products had sent a letter to the manufacturer freightliner noting the vehicles damaged condition when it was sold to denaples said george the air products spokesman and freightliner subsequently had voided the warrantywithout the warranty rothstein said his insurance company agreed to pay the  in repairs but when mechanics removed the dashboard rothstein said they found dead salamanders and dried mud they also found mold throughout the cabinthey did a mold test and there was mold everywhere rothstein saidirate rothstein said he threatened to sue and dunmore repair repurchased the truck for  rothsteins truck along with other flood trucks are parked in a trucking company lot off interstate  near pittston luzerne countyafter learning of the truck investigators for the gaming control board subpoenaed and deposed rothstein in summer  months before the board awarded denaples a slots license along with his testimony rothstein supplied the investigators with documentation showing his truck was sold with a full warranty from dunmore repair and clear title from denaples auto sales the title was signed by denaples brother dominick former gaming board chairman decker said the board referred the matter in fall  to the department of state the gaming board dismissed the incident he said after the department reported it didnt have any proof there was anything illegalthe department responded to the morning calls questions with a statement issued by spokeswoman catherine ennisthe positive evidence uncovered by the department indicated that there were no fraudulent representations by either the denaples brothers or dunmore repair the purchasers were aware that the vehicles were damaged in a flood the denaples brothers were not involved directly in the sale of the vehicles to the complainantsennis declined further comment referring questions to penndot which handles vehicle titling a penndot spokeswoman danielle klinger said penndot does not comment on individual casesthe fbi investigated interviewing rothstein air products and leaseplan usa before determining there were no federal criminal violations vehicle titling is a state functionwe did look at the exploding katrina truck and had the northern district of new york take a look at it and they issued a declaration based on the lack of federal venue since it involvedtitling said jerria williams an fbi spokeswoman in philadelphiawilliams said the us attorney in binghamton ny was assigned the case because of a conflict involving thomas m marino the former us attorney in scranton marino had recused himself after notifying the department of justice that he was a reference on denaples slots application marino resigned in october and now works as an inhouse attorney for denaplesdenaples attorney richard sprague of philadelphia said he never even knew the fbi investigated the katrina truck incident we never got an inquiry from the fbi or any indication of interest sprague saidthe fbi referred the case to the state police after which penndot finally branded the truck a flood vehicle in may there are roughly  certified flood vehicles from hurricanes katrina and rita said frank scafidi a spokesman for the national insurance crime bureau a nonprofit agency operated by the insurance industrya flood vehicle is identified as being completely or partially submerged in water to the extent that its body engine transmission or other mechanical component parts have been damaged according to the crime bureau because of the flooding many of the vehicles eventually develop electrical problems and catch fire as rothsteins truck did said scafidiwe recognize that the opportunity for this kind of title washing is bigger than its ever been scafidi said but its not a federal crime more often than not these are state violations regarding misrepresentation of a titlemore than two years after buying the truck rothstein says hes suffering from a number of health issues including an everpresent cough which he blames on the mold in the truckright before i spoke to the fbi i called air products and spoke to their chief mechanic who said he traveled to louisiana right after the hurricane and was floating around the trucks in a rowboat rothstein said he said they were submerged in toxic waterreporters kevin amerman and

pennsylvanias budding slotmachine casino industry michael rubinkam few insiders bet against scrantonarea businessman louis denaples when he bought the shuttered and decaying mount airy lodge resort for  million and declared his intention to enter pennsylvanias budding slotmachine casino industrydenaples  had just about everything going for him he was powerful wealthy and wellknown in northeastern pennsylvania he had given lavishly to politicians of all stripes and his main competitor for a highly coveted slots license was an interloper from new jerseyso it was hardly unexpected when the pennsylvania gaming control board gave its unanimous approval to denaples in december  awarding him a license after what it called an extensive investigation into his backgroundbut now that a grand jury has accused denaples of lying to the board about his relationship with a pair of reputed mobsters the owner of the  million mount airy casino resort is under fresh scrutiny — as is the process by which pennsylvania was supposed to shield its newest industry slots from organized crimethis particular license has been fraught with problems from the very beginning said rep doug reichley rlehigh a slots critic it has raised a lot of concerns about the manner in which the license was awardedthe gaming board has said that its background investigation of denaples turned up nothing to indicate he was of unsuitable character to own a casinoindeed he came with a sparkling resumefrom humble beginnings his family couldnt afford to send him to college denaples built an empire that includes two landfills an auto parts store and interests in banking real estate garbage disposal heavy equipment and scores of other businesseshe has said he owns and operates nearly  businesses his land holdings are vast hes held seats on a number of boards including blue cross of northeastern pennsylvaniadenaples is also a philanthropist donating large sums to scranton preparatory school — where he sent his seven children — the university of scranton the roman catholic diocese of scranton the united way and many other charitable and nonprofit institutionsthe lone blemish on his record a felony conviction from  did not disqualify him from getting a casino license under state gaming law because it was more than  years old gambling regulators did not even take note of it when they filed their official adjudication explaining their reasons for giving denaples a licensebut that case has long provided fodder for speculation about denaples alleged ties to the underworldprosecutors said denaples who supplied heavy equipment to lackawanna county to clean up damage from tropical storm agnes in  plotted with three county employees to falsify records to obtain  in federal reimbursementsdenaples was tried for fraud but the trial ended in a hung jury when one juror — whose husband had been bribed by a reputed mobster — held out for acquittal denaples subsequently pleaded no contest to a conspiracy count paid a  fine and spent three years on probationan fbi investigation later revealed that james osticco alleged underboss of the bufalino crime family of northeastern pennsylvania bribed the holdout jurors husband with  a set of tires and a pocket watch to influence his wifes voteosticco was convicted and sentenced to eight years in prison denaples himself was never accused of wrongdoing and he denied having any knowledge of jury tamperingdenaples supporters say he has long since redeemed himself for a yearold mistakesal cognetti jr the former assistant us attorney who prosecuted denaples recently acted as a character witness on his slots applicationyou judge a man by his whole life not something that happened  years ago and i think when you judge mr denaples by his whole life he is an honorable person cognetti told the gaming board in octoberbut while denaples has been able to put his agnes woes behind him he has been less successful at shaking persistent rumors about the mobsome of the information connecting denaples to the mafia is contained in old reports by the pennsylvania crime commission the state agency investigated organized crime and public corruption but wielded no prosecutorial power and was disbanded in  amid criticism that it treated rumor and hearsay as factcommission reports from the s said that william delia a reputed member of the bufalino crime family of northeastern pennsylvania sold space at denaples keystone sanitary landfill informants later alleged that denaples paid protection money to deliaaccording to a  federal affidavit one informant claimed that denaples and delia met weekly for many years and that denaples has become a rich man through delias contacts in new york and new jerseywhile under law enforcement surveillance delia was twice spotted visiting denaples auto parts in dunmore according to the affidavit which was filed in support of a search warrant for delias car and home denaples was not charged nor were his properties targeted for searchesprosecutors said denaples also lied to the gaming board when he denied any connection to the late russell bufalino a notorious mob boss from scranton who died in  at age bufalino was said to have helped organize the infamous  summit of mafia bosses in apalachin ny which was broken up by police a senate subcommittee once called him one the most ruthless and powerful leaders of the mafia in the united states delia who once served as bufalinos driver allegedly took control of the remnants of bufalinos organization in the early srep paul clymer rbucks an outspoken gambling critic says denaples political connections were the no  factor in getting a gambling licensecampaign finance reports show that denaples has given heavily to republicans and democrats alike pouring more than  into pennsylvania politicians coffers in  and  alone among the recipients of his largesse was senate democratic leader robert j mellow of lackawanna

this post with symbolism that was ripe and thick as the mountain laurel in june the old poconos died near the end of last century with a single gunshot wound to the head the victim was emil wagner a yearold immigrant from czechoslovakia who on a november night stepped into the bathroom of a white mansion just up the hill from the resort complex called mount airy lodge where he’d spent most of his life begun as a small boardinghouse in  by his favorite aunt suzanne martens and her husband john mount airy had grown — “metastasized” might be a better word — into a sprawling agglomeration of more than  rooms on  acres for decades it had represented everything that the pocono mountains could be — good and bad it was glamorous and gaudy it was sylvan yet shabby but for several generations of east coast city dwellers mount airy epitomized the vast squaremile rural vacationland in which it was just a small glittering dot it was a socalled superresort its afternoons scheduled solid with games and contests and its nights reserved for showroom entertainment and frolicking in the quintessential heartshaped tubs for years the regular ritual in the white mansion on the hill was a cocktail party to welcome that weekend’s headliner — ­everyone from bob hope to engelbert humperdinck performed in mount airy’s crystal room in the ’s and ’s the soiree would be hosted even after she had handed over control of the resort to her three nephews by suzanne martens the “first lady of the poconos” who would let her guests gather in the marbled entry foyer before she paraded down the long curving central staircase in gown and jewels “very sunset boulevard” the redoubtable television personality joe franklin remarked once like most declines the death of mount airy happened first slowly and then all at once over several decades air travel got cheaper and a mere car ride to the mountains didn’t seem like a real vacation anymore the owners bet on growth at the exact wrong time borrowed big to build a new hotel wing and were subsequently crushed under heavy debt just as an economic recession hit things got bad quickly people who knew emil wagner well were aware of a subtle and ready sense of humor but also a strong streak of pride as he placed the barrel of the caliber handgun to his head that night wagner was hours away from a dreaded trip to the monroe county courthouse where he would be forced after years of tiptoeing on the edge of insolvency to give up his resort “emil knew he was going to lose the resort and it was like losing his child” says a friend “he didn’t have any family or any kids so unfortunately that was the end of him too” squeezing the trigger emil wagner chose to die before mount airy did eight years have gone by since wagner’s death and the symbolic demise of the old poconos this fall what could become a shiny symbol for the new poconos emerges with the opening of the renamed mount airy casino resort an expensive bet by a mediashy mogul that the future of the mountain vacationland can be secured by tens of thousands of slotmachine players a completely rebuilt mount airy designed to become a kind of borgataamongthetrees ushers in a new industry — one that might have saved the old mount airy had it come sooner the man behind the revival — a junk magnate from the scranton area named louis denaples — knows a little something about turning brokendown wrecks into money mines in his own version of a classic horatio alger story denaples — who grew up poor one of nine children — tells the tale of buying a junked car for  when he was a teen literally shouldering it up the steep hills to his house over the course of two days then stripping off every piece that he could sell he gave some of the profit to his family bought another junker and repeated the process many many times as the years passed and he married and started his own large family seven kids eventually denaples built a thriving kingdom of junk one that was reportedly good for  million per year but that was just his starter company somewhere along the way louis denaples had the astute business revelation that there could be untold riches in handling stuff that people threw away in the late ’s he opened the keystone sanitary landfill just outside scranton at the conjunction of two highways that led to the great garbage manufacturers new jersey and new york to the east and philadelphia to the south the landfill made denaples even richer he’s now estimated to be worth  million in the dark days of mount airy’s decline emil wagner and his cousins had approached this nearby deeppocketed businessman with a plea to help them survive “we knew mr denaples he was a dear friend of the family” says frank martens one of suzanne martens’s nephews who divided the responsibilities of running mount airy could denaples help the family get out from under its debt “we really wanted it to happen but at that time it wasn’t feasible for him” martens remembers things changed in  soon after pennsylvania politicians legalized gambling in the state denaples bought the boardedup mount airy for  million a few months later he sold everything salvageable at a twoday auction attended by tens of thousands of people many of whom showed up fueled by nostalgia for the old resort denaples soon unveiled plans for a new poconos resort with gambling at its heartshaped heart leaving aside the pesky detail that he needed to apply and compete for one of a small number of gaming licenses the fabulously wealthy junk man announced that he would spend — he alone there were no outside investors listed — about  million to build a room highend hotel with  slot machines and that was just the start later development would add  more hotel rooms conference facilities and space for even more slot machines future plans envision homes and townhouses clustered around little themed village squares all adding up to a possible price tag of  billion denaples started building before he was awarded a license this certainly isn’t john and suzanne martens’s poconos though the man who will run the mount airy casino operations philadelphia native and atlantic city veteran joe d’amato says he’s confident the new mount airy will come to symbolize the poconos as strongly as the old resort yet even before the old mount airy entered its final decline the poconos had begun a huge transformation experiencing more than a decadelong growth spurt that has changed the nature of the region in ways that are both annoyingly obvious and subtle but significant there are now traffic jams on what were once quiet country roads a construction boom helped create jobs but also sent taxes spiraling upward with tens of thousands of new homes planned for the coming years the strange urbanization of this once rural retreat will continue raising a crucial question posed recently by the poconos’ daily newspaper will you still want to live here or visit for a while it seemed that the ubiquitous advertising slogan emil wagner spent so much to spread could be transferred easily to louis denaples — the oncepoor kid from scranton seemed poised to become “the new host with the most in the poconos” but as events played out this summer and insinuations of unsavory affiliations in denaples’s past led to a grand jury investigation that raised the specter of him losing his gaming license it appeared that louis denaples — who doesn’t smoke drink or gamble — might be the high roller with the most to lose for more than a month in the late days of summer i drove around the poconos stopping at inns and resorts restaurants and offices trying to get an idea of what the hell was going on here on a few trips i just drove realizing the immense size and diverse nature of a region where one trip can take you from a beautifully renovated thcentury inn in quaint milford to a nudist colony in more hardscrabble palmerton or from the whinymotorboatandjetskicovered lake wallenpaupack to a calm canoe on the delaware river at the water gap i thought i knew the poconos like louis denaples i grew up nearby in scranton i’ve hiked in the parks here boated and swum in the lakes and pools performed as a musician in a number of the honeymoon resorts somewhere there’s a photo of me cavorting in one of the twostorytall jacuzzis built to look like champagne glasses ten years ago i spent months looking in vain for a permanent weekend house here now a decade later the poconos seemed both mundanely familiar and startlingly changed so i went to see the man they call “mr poconos” for a briefing robert uguccioni was about to retire as executive director of the pocono mountains visitors bureau after four decades in the job he’s a squat bearish guy with a gruff friendliness and he’s quite a talker one who considering his long career as a promoter is surprisingly frank he began by telling me that just five or six years ago “we were closing more places than we were opening we had a lot of issues — timeshare issues quality of product we had a tacky image with the heartshaped tubs and the champagne towers that became a symbol of tackiness and old resort” that image had already led some in the region’s tourism business to form a kind of breakaway republic on the poconos’ northeast corner where the renegades envisioned a more upscale and ecofriendly vacation area that they were calling the upper delaware river region and a few resorts to the northwest — including a posh new destination spa near hawley — didn’t mention the poconos at all in their marketing preferring to be in what they called the “lake region” of pennsylvania mr poconos bristled a bit at the thought of a secessionist movement prospects have turned for the better recently uguccioni insisted and ran through a litany of new projects on the books from a spate of familyfriendly waterpark resorts to some new nontourism businesses “i think we’re at a point right now that the future looks bright” he said early in our long conversation “but there are some real issues here” we were sitting in a renovated brick building on main street in stroudsburg the seat of monroe county a county whose population increased nearly  percent over the past  years in pike county just next door the population more than doubled over the same period uguccioni calls it “urban crawl” but “urban rush” is probably a better way to describe what happened about  years ago developers and builders started buying ads in the new york media promising middle and lowerincome new yorkers crushed by high rents and a hopelessly expensive metro real estate market the chance to grab the good life in the country homes could be had for a fraction of the prices near new york the mortgage payments would barely exceed city rents in even the unfashionable boroughs and because the poconos were less than  miles away you could keep your higherpaying city job and commute “you see those ads in the newspaper that you can own a home for  a month” says mario scavello the state representative in the newly created th legislative district in the poconos himself a  refugee from the bronx “you’re renting in new york and you say ‘wow what a deal i’ll make the commute’” after scavello moved his family to mount pocono he commuted up to six hours a day for years but for a lot of those city transplants the poconos have turned out to be anything but the promised land before the current nationwide lending crisis monroe county seemed to be a test market for predatory lending practices and there were many stories of inflated home appraisals fudged mortgage applications and any number of deceptions a spike in foreclosures — over a recent year period a fifth of the homes in monroe county were in foreclosure at one time or another — has prompted prosecutions studies hearings and no doubt untold suffering whoever was to blame it’s becoming clear that the mountains have been changed by the influx of urbanites many of them citybred minorities entering a previously homogenous rural area and the peculiar circumstances created by a commuting culture — that daily six hours of driving isn’t uncommon — is starting to change the rather innocent nature of the region folks who brought their children to the country for a nice home good schools and a better life are hardly ever home to see their kids so with a lot of teenagers spending a lot of unsupervised time without transportation in rural communities — the kids are said to call their cozy country homes “green prisons” — the need for some connection has led to what local police describe as a noticeable surge in gang activity like tagging and initiation crimes “we have people moving in who are great people and really help the economy of this area” bob uguccioni told me “but they bring some of the problems of the cities with them” about a week before i went to visit uguccioni i was driving through the area and picked up a copy of the pocono record the region’s top newspaper the lead story told of three very urbanstyle crimes that had happened in the poconos the previous day an armed robbery at an atm a spray of mm bullets at a housing development with the innocentsounding name of pocono farms east no one was hit and the arrest of  adults after a sevenmonth sting operation on charges of intent to deliver drugs including marijuana cocaine and crack what really struck me after reading the story was the resigned and ironic nature of the headline all in a day’s crime i called the woman who wrote the story susan koomar the record’s senior managing editor and we met for lunch not far from the site of the atm robbery “i hate to be too negative” said koomar “but we’re at this point where we kind of have the worst of a rural area — no infrastructure really limited public water and public sewers bad roads not enough social services — and we really have the worst of the city crimes increasing traffic issues that we’re not equipped to deal with” the editor had brought along her colleague howard frank and over the course of lunch they tried to make sense of their adopted home but eventually decided it was impossible “right now” koomar said “it’s schizophrenic around here” they told stories of local township officials who wore camouflage hunting caps to official meetings where they dealt with multimilliondollar development proposals presented by bigcity lawyers in fancy tailored suits there was a tale of a family living in a development with the idyllic name “a pocono country place” who felt the need to hire a bouncer for their daughter’s sweet  party reportedly after the bouncer was stabbed in an altercation nobody — not even the parents — would help the police and then there were the really crazy things that happened recently last may a cell of six suspected terrorists was arrested in a rented home on big bass lake and charged with planning to attack fort dix and kill soldiers then in july a huge police force mobilized near mount pocono to search for two men who were suspects in the shooting of two new york city policemen in the midst of the manhunt a new york times reporter wrote a story speculating that the poconos had somehow become the kind of place to which the kind of people who shoot cops would run both men were caught in the woods not far from mount pocono “we’ve always said ‘escape to the poconos’” bob uguccioni said “but that’s not what we meant” louis denaples has said that he looked all over the state when he was searching for a site for his casino ultimately he came back to the poconos because it was an established resort area near his hometown and as he told a panel of regulators “it needs to be picked up” denaples declined to be interviewed for this article after he announced his plans to pump nearly half a billion dollars into a rural county denaples was met with little local opposition probably because the governor and legislators had the good sense to promise that most of the gaming tax revenues would be dedicated to property tax relief but denaples needed more than the goodwill of the locals he had to convince a sevenmember panel to give him a license he was competing with  other casino proposals from around the state including one from the new owner of an oldline resort called pocono manor just down the road the scranton businessman went on what for him was a charm offensive over the years as his empire grew there are now some  different businesses worth  billion denaples managed to keep a low public profile around scranton which only fueled speculation of what he was really like i’ve been collecting denaples stories for nearly two decades ever since i heard about a local television reporter named larry sparano who was caught on denaples’s property with a camera crew trying to film how scrapped autos were polluting a creek “get used to the unemployment line” sparano remembers denaples saying sure enough soon after that sparano lost his job he pursued an independent quest to expose denaples’s various alleged abuses even starting his own newspaper but he was a mosquito biting an elephant in my collection of stories was the tale of how denaples had taken one vacation in his life — flying his family to disney world — and got so restless that after a day he left his wife with the kids and a wad of money and returned to his autoparts office another had it that during the lavish renovation of his home on the hill above his old junkyard denaples ordered gargantuan baseboard trim because his son liked to ride his motorcycle in the house it didn’t matter to me that some of these stories clearly were either patently untrue or wildly exaggerated taken together they came to create a denaples mystique as the actual louis denaples stepped gingerly into public view over the past year the picture that emerged was of an oldfashioned guy obsessed with work and business church and family “my children they call me ‘oldschool’” he told the casino commission “oldschool i may be” after years of ducking the press he agreed to meet with an editor and a reporter from the scranton timestribune — but only in the presence of one of his lawyers at one point the hometown journalists asked him if it was true that he essentially ran the whole of lackawanna county denaples said no he did give a glimpse at his daily life awake at  am to survey his businesses church every morning at  in his office for the rest of the day — his wife often brings him lunch dinner at home and in bed by  pm no tv no reading no movies it was business magnate as bore as the casino licensing process continued denaples was forced to appear in public and undergo a level of scrutiny to which he was unaccustomed he now had the counsel of the philadelphia public relations firm run by former rendell aide kevin feeley somehow the image that came into focus was a bizarre mix of mother teresa and machiavelli denaples had enough of a reputation for spreading money around to politicians of all stripes — one count estimated that denaples and two of his partnerships gave a total of at least  million just to state officials from  to  — that the scranton timestribune was prompted to compare him to an atm he also was known around scranton for his affiliations with various nonprofit boards and his large contributions to a number of local institutions now preening for the gaming commission denaples let reports emerge about his many smaller more personalized gifts — philanthropy that his daughter would describe as a “commitment to improving the human condition one charitable act at a time” it was a bold move of selfaggrandizement for this lowkey guy — and a sign of how high the stakes had become in his own personal gamble on gaming at a public forum early in  at the split rock resort denaples showed up with an unusual entourage howard frank covering the meeting for the pocono record just had to tell his editor “i remember howard calling me on the cell phone” susan koomar recalls “and saying ‘my god he’s got a priest with him and a nun’” the priest a childhood friend named joseph sica would accompany denaples to almost all of his casino licensing hearings becoming what pr man feeley would describe as a “talisman” but perhaps not an entirely lucky charm although denaples was awarded the gaming license lucky father sica would soon have to appear before a grand jury investigating his rich friend’s links to organized crime and whether denaples lied about them to the casino board louis denaples needed to come off as something of an altar boy because despite his great business success and repute as a philanthropist he is dogged by a  felony conviction related to overcharging for cleanup operations in the aftermath of hurricane agnes under the rules the offense occurred long enough ago that he was able to apply for a casino license but it left him open to increased scrutiny when the commission’s investigative wing performed its required due diligence on the applicant’s “good character” there have long been allegations that denaples has connections to reputed northeast pennsylvania crime boss william d’elia the legislation that set up a gambling commission in pennsylvania will never be considered a case study of good government the resulting operation seems rife with conflicts of interest and appears designed to be murky to public scrutiny for instance the commission has refused to make public the more than  letters of recommendation that louis denaples produced to bolster his license application in what former casino commission chairman tad decker claimed was an extensive investigation into denaples’s past the commission’s staff found nothing that would preclude a license but because of a bureaucratic dispute with the state police the commission wasn’t privy to information about ongoing sensitive law enforcement investigations and it turned out there was an investigation into the denaplesd’elia connection that led a grand jury in dauphin county to look into whether denaples lied to the casino commission if he did he could lose the license as reports of the grand jury investigation emerged denaples returned to his habit of ducking the press and his spokesman feeley repeatedly denied there was any connection between denaples and organized crime late this summer as workmen rushed in double shifts to finish construction of mount airy louis denaples displayed his remarkably bad instincts for public relations by nominating five people to an oversight panel that was supposed to be independent and monitor the operation of mount airy among the nominees was an old friend who served on the board of denaples’s scrantonbased bank after a few state representatives complained that the proposed panel was hardly independent four of the nominees quickly withdrew their names from consideration and a newly named panel temporarily delayed the casino’s planned midoctober opening because of the time needed for required background checks “the buck stops here” louis denaples had told commissioners during a hearing now the owner himself was certainly slowing things down one muggy latesummer day i took what had come to be a routine drive in the new poconos — quiet stretches rolling easily on a leafy sundappled road then stuck in an inexplicable traffic jam — and finally arrived at a compound of construction trailers just up the hill from the new mount airy casino resort i was meeting lisa denaples one of louis’s five daughters for a tour lisa denaples is attractive and polished a more ethnic cate blanchett she has practiced dentistry and studied law and will serve as the family point person at her father’s huge new investment we donned hard hats and safety glasses and traversed a muddy road down to the new casino hotel denaples talked of the research trips the design team had done when planning the new resort they were comparing it in style and feel not to say the converted horseracing track near scranton that is already drawing tens of thousands of gamblers but more “upscale vegas” like the bellagio or venetian or atlantic city’s borgata the hotel and casino even in their unfinished state were obviously going to be nice places plush yet modest and reminiscent of an older more genteel poconos with lots of fieldstone and rich woods and terrazzo tile and — in the hotel anyway — lots of glass to let in the significant outdoors louis denaples has said many times that his mount airy resort won’t compete with the rest of the poconos but will complement it it’s possible that his vision for a new poconos polished with expensive amenities and a cool casino floor may be tinted too much by nostalgia for a more innocent time that has long passed it may be too respectful of the ghost of emil wagner and not everyone is certain that denaples will “pick up” the poconos though he’s happy for the new local jobs state rep mario scavello says “i worry that gambling could bring in all kinds of social problems that we’ll be unable to control” during our tour of the new mount airy lisa denaples revealed little about her father except for the fact that he used to take the family on day trips to the dinky little amusement park nearby called memorytown now shuttered except for a tavern then as we were climbing a muddy road back to the construction trailers she promised that her father would make sure everything was done correctly and on time “he’s a driver” she said then she said that again “he’s a driver” and then a third time forces beyond denaples are driving the poconos they are strong and contradictory and i suspect that if i come back  years from now this place will once again seem mundanely familiar and changed beyond all recognition the essence of the poconos has always been a mixture of novelty and nostalgia during our tour of the new novelty the reborn and refashioned mount airy lisa denaples told a story about shopping at bloomingdale’s in manhattan the salesclerk asked where she was from when she told him “the poconos” he started singing the old mount airy lodge jingle
