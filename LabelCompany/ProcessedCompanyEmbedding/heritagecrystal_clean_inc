includerevenues decreased  to  million compared to  million in the third quarter of fiscal   yeartodate revenues decreased  to  million compared to  million in the first three quarters of fiscal   the yearoveryear decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decline in oil product pricing and specifically the approximate  decline in the market price for the type of base oil we sell our  third quarter ebitda was  million  for the first three quarters of fiscal  ebitda decreased  to  million compared to the first three quarters of   our environmental services segment includes parts cleaning containerized waste and vacuum services  during the third quarter environmental services revenues decreased  million or  compared to the third quarter of fiscal   environmental services revenues decreased  million or  for the first three quarters of  compared to the first three quarters of   average revenues per working day in the third quarter of fiscal  in our environmental services segment were approximately  compared to  in the third quarter of fiscal    our oil business segment includes used oil collection activities sales of recycled fuel oil and rerefining activities  during the third quarter of fiscal  oil business revenues of  million were flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal   during the first three quarters of fiscal  oil business revenues decreased  million to  million from  million in the first three quarters of fiscal   the revenue decrease was mainly due to lower selling prices for our base oil and rfo products which was partially offset by higher base oil volume sold the decline in revenue was further offset by increased revenue from used oil collection charges and stop fees of approximately  million during the first three quarters of   during the third quarter of fiscal  the average spot market price for the type of lubricating base oil we produce declined over  compared to the third quarter of fiscal   however the average spot market price during the third quarter was up approximately  compared to the second quarter of fiscal  during the third quarter of fiscal  we produced base oil at a rate of  of the nameplate capacity of our rerefinery which was a slightly lower rate compared to the two prior quarters in fiscal   the decreased production rate was mainly due to a planned extended shutdown during the fiscal third quarter sga expense for the third quarter of fiscal  was  million compared to  million during the third quarter of fiscal   in the first three quarters of fiscal  sga expense was  million compared to  million in the first three quarters of fiscal   the increase in sga expense was due to unusually high legal expenses of  million during the third quarter of fiscal  and  million for the first three quarters of fiscal   the majority of these legal expenses pertain to matters stemming from our acquisition of fcc environmental including expenses incurred in connection with arbitration claims brought against the sellers of fcc environmental in order to enforce our rights under the stock purchase agreement  we are seeking reimbursement for legal fees incurred in these matters net income

common shareholders of  million for the first three quarters of fiscal   net income per share was  in the first three quarters of fiscal  compared to net income per share of  in the first three quarters of fiscal  the companys founder president and chief executive officer joe chalhoub commented we are pleased with the continued improvement in the profitability of our oil business segment over the last two quarters  during the third quarter we realized the benefit of an improvement in our base oil spread due primarily to higher base oil selling prices and a small improvement in our average used oil collection chargechalhoub added while revenue in our environmental services segment continued to be under pressure in the third quarter due to decreased activity at customers in and around the energy sector we expect to generate revenue growth in this segment during the fourth quarter  given the lack of revenue growth in the segment we are especially pleased with our improvement in operating margin for the quartermark devita chief financial officer stated we saw improved operating margin percentages in both of our business segments during the third quarter  during the third quarter our profit before corporate sga expense in the environmental services segment was  compared to  in the third quarter of fiscal   in our oil business segment our profit before corporate sga expense was  compared to  in the third quarter of fiscal devita added we are also pleased to report our cash flow from operations was approximately  million during the third quarter of fiscal   our cash balance at the end of the quarter was  million which represents a  million increase compared to the end of the second quarterdevita also added our net income attributable to common shareholders during the third quarter was negatively impacted by legal fees and other expenses stemming from our acquisition of fcc environmental  we believe a majority of the legal fees and other expenses

expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments       ebitda does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt       ebitda does not reflect tax expense or the cash requirements necessary to pay for tax obligations and       although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements       we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using ebitda only as a supplement     b legal fees incurred to resolve routine and nonroutine matters stemming from the acquisition of fcc
