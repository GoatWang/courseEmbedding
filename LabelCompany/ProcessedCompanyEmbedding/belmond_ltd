release for detail hamilton bermuda business wire belmond ltd nysebel the “company” owners partowners or managers of  luxury hotel restaurant tourist train and river cruise properties including three scheduled to open over the course of the next twelve months which operate in  countries today announced its results for the second quarter ended june   roeland vos president and chief executive officer remarked “results for our second quarter were in line with our expectations with constant currency revpar at the bottom of our guidance range reflecting specific challenges in select parts of our global portfolio however we were pleased with the directional performance at a number of properties and benefited from a reduction in central overheads compared to the prioryear quarter the yearoveryear net decrease in our second quarter  adjusted ebitda was primarily due to an expected decrease in ebitda at our italian hotels due in large part to the biennale art festival in venice italy  which occurs every other year and took place in  and an anticipated lull in demand for our two hotels in brazil ahead of august’s summer olympic games in rio de janeiro  during the second quarter we hosted an investor and analyst meeting in new york at which we unveiled a focused strategic plan to double the company’s adjusted ebitda and properties in operation by  the message we provided at our meeting was straightforward we have successfully repositioned the company in recent years we have a solid foundation from which we expect to grow and we have a clear strategy with a defined roadmap and ambitious but achievable goals we intend to execute our strategic plan in a disciplined manner by focusing on three key areas driving organic growth continuing to build brand awareness and expanding our global footprint with nearly half of our growth expected to come from existing properties organic growth is a vital component of the plan and at the investor and analyst meeting we provided specific examples of operating initiatives already executed or underway we continue to be engaged in identifying and evaluating revenuegenerating costsaving and investment opportunities across the globe and we anticipate bringing additional initiatives to market in the near future driving the other half of our growth our global footprint expansion efforts are also gaining traction and i am pleased to report that we recently announced a new luxury overnight train experience in peru  belmond andean explorer which we expect to launch in may  this additional train product will follow and complement our new luxury overnight train experience in ireland  belmond grand hibernian which is scheduled to commence operations in the third quarter of  we are encouraged by the progress we have already made on our strategic plan and will provide regular updates on the achievement of our  aspirational goals as we move forward looking specifically at the remainder of  we see promising indications of solid growth but acknowledge the inherent uncertainty of recent global events in particular we believe that it is too early to assess the full impact on belmond of the united kingdom’s decision to leave the european union which has led to the recent decrease in the value of the british pound at a highlevel this decision primarily impacts the company’s results in two ways translation of pounddenominated operations and central overheads to us dollars and demand for our luxury travel experiences from british guests from a translation standpoint a decrease in the pound is marginally beneficial to the company’s us dollar reported results due to the fact that the majority of the company’s central overheads are pound denominated on the demand side  of the company’s hotel guests originate from the united kingdom  although we have not yet seen a material shift in their booking behavior even with these uncertainties we expect to have a solid third quarter driven largely by the benefit of the olympic games on belmond copacabana palace in rio de janeiro and demand for our european hotels during their peak season as such for the full year  we are maintaining our guidance for same store constant currency revpar growth of between  and  second quarter  operating results total revenue for the second quarter of  was  million  a  million or

information on the company can be found at investorbelmondcom use of nongaap financial measures and definitions management analyzes the operating performance of the company on the basis of earnings before interest foreign exchange tax including tax on unconsolidated companies depreciation and amortization ebitda and believes that ebitda a nongaap financial measure is a useful measure of operating performance for example to help determine the ability to incur capital expenditure or service indebtedness because it is not affected by nonoperating factors such as leverage and the historical cost of assets ebitda is also a financial performance measure commonly used in the hotel and leisure industry although the company’s ebitda may not be comparable in all instances to that disclosed by other companies ebitda does not represent net cash provided by operating investing and financing activities under us generally accepted accounting principles  us gaap is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings from operations or net earnings under us gaap for purposes of evaluating operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings  losses of the company are nongaap financial measures and do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by us gaap they are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies which may be calculated differently and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of performance prescribed by us gaap management considers adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings  losses to be meaningful indicators of operations and uses them as measures to assess operating performance because when comparing current period performance with prior periods and with budgets management does so after having adjusted for nonrecurring items foreign exchange a noncash item disposals of assets or investments and certain other items some of which may be recurring that management does not consider indicative of ongoing operations or that could otherwise have a material effect on the comparability of the company’s operations adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings  losses are also used by investors analysts and lenders as measures of financial performance because as adjusted in the foregoing manner the measures provide a consistent basis on which the performance of the company can be assessed all references to constant currency represent a comparison between periods excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements the company calculates these amounts by translating prioryear results at currentyear exchange rates the company analyzes certain key financial measures on a constant currency basis to better understand the underlying results and trends of the business without distortion from the effects of currency movements cautionary statements
