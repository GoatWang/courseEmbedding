worldwide advanced heat and mass transfer by amir faghri book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide heat and mass transfer can be encountered in many applications ranging from design and optimization of traditional engineering systems such as heat exchangers turbine electronic cooling heat pipes and food processing equipment to emerging technologies in sustainable energy biological systems security information technology and nanotechnology the purpose of this textbook is to present the subject of heat and mass transfer with a focus on the significant advances in the field in the last decade while emphasizing the basic fundamental principles it provides advanced relevant materials in heat and mass transfer in a single volume for undergraduate senior and graduate students instead of relying upon several books engineering students in a wide variety of engineering disciplines  from mechanical and chemical to biomedical and materials engineering  must master the principles of heat and mass transfer as an essential tool in analyzing and designing any system or systems wherein heat and mass are transferred this textbook was developed to address that need with a clear presentation of the fundamentals ample problem sets to reinforce that knowledge and tangible examples of how this knowledge is put to use in engineering

in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide the objective of this report is to examine the performance characteristics of heat pipes and phasechange materials with multiple localized heat sources as well as the fundamental problems related to their specific applications a numerical analysis is presented for the overall performance of heat pipes with single or multiple heat sources the analysis includes the heat conduction in the wall and liquidwick regions as well as the compressibility effect of the vapor flow inside the heat pipe the solutions are compared with existing experimental data for the vapor and wall temperatures at both low and high temperatures in addition the performance of heat pipes with localized heat input including the effects of axial and circumferential heat conduction under high and low working temperatures was investigated the numerical results for block heating a heat pipe with low working temperatures indicate a good agreement with existing experimental data microminiature heat pipe technology for electronic cooling book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide detailed analysis and experimental data presented in this report show that longitudinal groove designs are crucial to increase the heat transport capacity of miniature heat pipes the steady state mathematical models of a miniature axially grooved heat pipe with micro grooves are developed where the importance of the interfacial phenomena at the surfaces of the ultra thin is emphasized the predicted capillary and boiling limitations as well as thermal resistance are compared to detailed inhouse experimental data on miniature and conventional axially grooved heat pipes it is found that flat miniature heat pipes are easily capable of withstanding heat fluxes on the order of  wsq cm at the evaporator wall advanced flat miniature heat pipes are suggested and modeled to further increase the maximum heat flux at the evaporator wall additional experiments carried out for the heat pipe evaporators with forced convection and heat fluxes in excess of  wsq cm proved that capillary limitation is the limiting one

disciplines from mechanical and chemical to biomedical and materials engineering must master the principles of transport phenomena as an essential tool in analyzing and designing any system or systems wherein momentum heat and mass are transferred this textbook was developed to address that need with a clear presentation of the fundamentals ample problem sets to reinforce that knowledge and tangible examples of how this knowledge is put to use in engineering design professional engineers too will find this book invaluable as reference for everything from heat exchanger design to chemical processing system design and more key features develops an understanding of the thermal and physical behavior of multiphase systems with phase change including microscale and porosity for practical applications in heat transfer bioengineering materials science nuclear engineering environmental engineering process engineering biotechnology and nanotechnology brings all three forms of phase change ie liquid  vapor solid  liquid and solid  vapor into one volume and describes them from one perspective in the context of fundamental treatment presents the generalized integral and differential transport phenomena equations for multicomponent multiphase systems in local instance as well as averaging formulations the molecular approach is also discussed with the connection between microscopic and molecular approaches presents basic principles of analyzing transport phenomena in multiphase systems with emphasis on melting solidification sublimation vapor deposition condensation evaporation boiling and twophase flow heat transfer at the micro and macro levels solidliquidvapor interfacial phenomena including the concepts of surface tension wetting phenomena disjoining pressure contact angle thin films and capillary phenomena including interfacial balances for mass species momentum and energy for multicomponent and multiphase interfaces are discussed ample examples and endofchapter
