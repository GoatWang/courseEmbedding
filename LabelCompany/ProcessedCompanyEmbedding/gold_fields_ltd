feet high are all that’s left of the mining operations that were stopped in  the promise of gold has since faded but residents complain that dust from the huge dumps of waste soil left after extracting the precious metal is a health hazard these ‘cyanide mounds’ as the locals call them are a slow poison that is causing people to suffer from respiratoryrelated diseases said activists a claim that health officials said is exaggeratedwith no resolution in sight m jagadeeshwar third additional district and sessions judge at kgf expressed interest in finding a solution at a meeting convened in his chamber on monday he asked officials of various departments to coordinate and draw an action plan to find a permanent solutionaccording to residents and local activists  million tonnes of waste has been produced over a century and dumped at  locations in kgf “for people living nearby the problem worsens during the monsoon and on windy days as they are forced to inhale the dust” said a resident and added that the period from june to august is particularly bad with a rise in cases of bronchial disorders and allergies ashok kumar a trader at mg market in kgf alleged that the milk produced by cattle grazing in the area is polluted “vegetables in the markets are covered with dust which is a cause for concern among buyers” he said madan who lives in new mill block alleged that

criticism that arsenic content of the mines adversely affected vegetation animals and human beings he said “the waste and any arsenic content must have settled and become hard over the last  years and since high density rocks were crushed during mining there is not much chance of dust being dispersed by the winds movement of people over the mounds causes the soil to loosen”planting saplingsefforts to plant saplings over the mounds to prevent dust from spreading did not yield much success “a serious and scientific way needs to be found to solve the issue permanently” said m gule gowda a farmer

fields ltd stock is at the time of writing resting near its week low the stock has shed all of its  gainscomparison to the other gold majors shows that gold fields is underperforming the industrygold fields has lower debt and a higher all in sustaining cost aisc than most gold mining majorsthe south deep mine and gold fields project development pipeline provide plenty of excess reserves and resources for longterm productionunlike many of the gold majors gold fields still has substantial room to improve its operating performance making the stock worth considering at current prices source company presentation energy and mines  introduction as an investor i cannot help but lean towards a contrarian approach rather than being drawn to companies that have been outperforming their industry in recent months i look for companies that have been underperforming their industry especially in terms of share price i tend to like these companies for an investment thesis if i can convince myself that a the ways in which the company is underperforming can be improved upon with time ie it is not a fixed cost structure limiting financial results rather it might be weak operating performance and b the companys management does not appear to be totally incompetent from this perspective i analyze the gold mining majors as they continue to shed their  gains to a decreasing gold price and i analyze one of the worst performers of  in detail gold fields ltd nysegfi gold market outlook the gold mining industry in general has been on a sharp downward trend since the election of president donald trump in the united states his election seemed to have bolstered economic confidence particularly in the manufacturing and mining industries industrial metals not precious metals precious metals often viewed as a safe haven investment typically maintain a negative correlation to market confidence the price of gold has fallen from its highs approaching troy ounce ozt in junejuly to ozt at the time of writing source infomine another macroeconomic factor affecting the gold price is the recent decision by the us federal government to raise interest rates by  basis points the us government aims to maintain this trend of interest rate hiking into the future an environment of increasing interest rates is generally viewed as negative for the price of gold because gold is a noninterest bearing asset higher interest rates will thus increase the appeal of keeping savings in an interestgenerating savings account rather than in gold however as the investopedia explains nicely this correlation historically does not exist the interest rate gold correlation can also be viewed from this perspective the us federal government raises interest rates to calm an overheating economy encouraging us citizens to consider saving their money rather than spending or investing it thus interest rates tend to rise during times of rapid unstable economic expansion ie during economic conditions leading up to a market crash from this perspective the higher the interest rate becomes the closer the us economy has come to an inevitable market downturn which in turn benefits the gold price either way i take interest rates into little consideration when evaluating the future gold price lastly a positive gold price macroeconomic factor that is underway is that the annual production of gold is expected to shrink over the coming years because of reduced capital spending over the extended downturn in gold prices since  in terms of simple supply and demand economics decreasing gold production on a yearly basis should serve to boost the price of gold supply and demand economics only apply loosely to gold however because the large majority of produced gold is not truly consumed rather it remains in bullion form as an investment and can be reintroduced to the gold supplydemand equation whenever people storing gold decide to sell it is impossible to predict the future of the price of gold but given the above headwinds and tailwinds i am confident enough to potentially increase my position in gold miners on the presumption that the downside related to a decreasing gold price is currently limited gold mining majors performance in  with this thesis i begin my look at the gold mining majors performance over the last year source scottradecom with gold fields stock price in purple see the purple star for current yearly return this chart demonstrates that gold fields is the only one of these major gold miners whose stock price has increased roughly  over the past year gold fields is dramatically underperforming its peers barrick gold corp nyseabx kinross gold corp nysekgc newmont mining corp nysenem yamana gold inc nyseauy and anglogold ashanti ltd nyseau the only company on this chart with a similar performance to gold fields is goldcorp inc nysegg to understand why this underperformance is occurring i will compare several important metrics between these companies it is important to note that the metrics below far from fully explain the share price movements of each stock all of the gold majors have been actively working to improve their performance throughout the year via a myriad of actions too numerous to cover here debt debt load is important to consider when evaluating the share price performance of these gold mining majors particularly during the massive midyear upswing in the gold price stocks with a greater debt load are at a higher risk of default when the gold prices are low thus they will experience more dramatic swings in share price when the price of gold moves as summarized nicely in this market realist article comparing barrick newmont goldcorp yamana gold and kinross barrick and kinross carry the highest debtequity and debtasset ratios among these majors source market realist it is no coincidence that barrick and kinross stocks have outperformed most of the gold majors over the past year a quick look at gold fields recent financial statements reveals a debtequity ratio of   and a debtasset ratio of   source company presentation total assets shareholders equity and net debt were used in the above calculations these ratios particularly the low debtasset ratio place gold fields ltd right alongside the debt position of goldcorp and yamana gold it is no surprise to see that the gold fields ltd share price has underperformed most majors the company has less upside in an increasing gold price market as a result of its relatively low debt position note this also means the company has less downside in a decreasing gold price environment to suggest that gold fields should be trading in the same price range that it was a year ago is questionable however when companies such as barrick are still trading at a  premium to their share price a year ago all in sustaining costs all in sustaining cost aisc is a valuable metric when evaluating the ability of a gold miner to generate free cash flow this metric attempts to factor in expenses from every aspect of running a gold mining company even those not directly related to a single mines operation to determine the profit margin a company is making per each ounce of gold mined the aisc of a companys operations can drastically affect the profitability of the company particularly in a low gold price environment companies with lower aisc will be better suited to a low gold price whereas conversely companies with a higher aisc will have a greater leverage to a higher gold price at the end of  the aisc of the major gold miners was as follows source miningcom perhaps gold fields greatest challenge lies here gold fields has one of the highest aisc values in the industry the company continued to reduce its aisc into  as did all of the majors but it still is around oz source company presentation with one of the highest aisc values in the industry gold fields will struggle to remain profitable in a gold price environment that many of the gold majors can thrive in not a positive outlook for the company in terms of share price movement this higher aisc provides a greater leverage to the gold price perhaps explaining the substantial upswing in the share price in julyaugust correlating to a higher gold price during that time goldcorp on the other hand having both low debt and a notably lower aisc of below oz experienced less leverage in its share price to the midyear gold price increase but also less downside when the gold price began retreating in the fall gold fields a company with relatively low debt and poor assets compared to its peers not exactly a solid investment thesis looking more closely into gold fields operations may provide a different outlook however gold fields mining operations gold fields current mining operations falls into four regions with additional regions where they have ongoing mining projects source company presentation source company website in  the large majority of production came from their mining operations in australia and ghana whereas the vast majority of their reserves and resources come from the south african region all attributable to the south deep mine gold fields only operation there source company presentation the company also has significant polymetallic mineral resources in three project areas chile philippines and finland gold fields highest grade production regions are south africa and australia source company presentation the high grade and massive reserveresource size of the south deep mine are promising for the longterm potential of gold fields as reserves and resources decline south deep is likely to account for an increasing portion of gold fields production profile next analysis of gold fields aisc by region source company presentation the aisc values from ghana peru and australia of oz oz and oz respectively are all competitive compared to other major gold miners the blaring weakness here is the production from south deep with an aisc of oz and an all in cost aic of oz south deep although a promising mine with high grade and massive reserves and resources is currently in the process of achieving stable production during this production rampup south deep has been a major sore thumb in the operational and financial results of gold fields ltd and is likely responsible for much of the underperformance of gold fields share price the south deep gold mine gold fields upside potential since acquiring it in  the south deep gold mine has been a flagship asset and major focus for gold fields ltd gold fields strategy for the mine when it acquired it was a longterm overhaul of the existing mine plan replacing higher cost more dangerous labor intensive mining with mechanized mining techniques the mechanized mine plan projected  ozyear production until  with the full mine life with lower production stages extending until  with a combined reserves and resource estimate of  million ounces of gold south deep is the second largest gold resource in the world behind only freeportmcmorans nysefcx grasberg mine which surprisingly is a primary copper mine gold is recovered as a byproduct the initial mine plan also forecasted aisc as low as oz which would significantly improve gold fields cash flow if realized however achieving this nameplate operational capacity has proven to be excessively difficult over the past years with accidents a complicated ore body trouble finding skilled labor etc continuing to delay the rampup of the mine gold fields had forecast production at  oz for the year but continued operational trouble including an employee death in september may result in lower production also in september ceo nick holland announced that the production at gold fields south deep mine will be smaller than initially planned for at least the next three years with a focus on stable production and profitability instead of high volume the company is thus now expecting to fall short of the initial mine plan for the foreseeable future however a focus on profitability suggests the financial burden of this operation will continue to shrink and reverse to a profit going forward gold fields plans to provide an updated operational outlook in february of  for the south deep mine gold fields nearterm catalysts focusing on other operations there are several recent news articles relevant to the nearterm performance of gold fields first the government of ghana recently decided to reduce their corporate tax rate from  to  and to adjust the gold production royalty rate from a fixed  to a sliding scale royalty rate source seeking alpha contributor alberto abaterusso this update is very good news for gold fields going forward and provides much needed relief to the operating margins of its assets in ghana in light of this gold fields has recently announced in november a plan to invest  billion dollars to extend the life of its damang mine in ghana from  in ironically similar news in terms of capital investment gold fields and silver standard resources nasdaqssri have withdrawn a billion dollar offer to buy kirkland lake gold inc otcpkkgilf it seems that gold fields has opted to reinvest in its own projects instead i would have liked to see this bid go through as kirkland lake gold offers attractively high grade assets in canada however gold fields has plenty of its own brownfield and greenfield projects to develop so i am not concerned about this rejection on december  gold fields announced the acquisition of a  stake and a  net smelter return royalty for the gruyere gold project in australia from gold road resources ltd otcpkelkmf for a million potentially adding half of the  million contained ounces of gold grading  gramstonne to its future production profile in australia this acquisition in addition to gold fields current projects in finland the philippines and chile provides a considerable development pipeline for gold fields investment thesis the continued negative operational performance at south deep and the struggle of the gfi stock price relative to other gold majors sparks my interest in the company from a valuecontrarian perspective the continued operating and financial troubles holding down the stock price of gold fields relative to other gold majors leaves significant room for operatingfinancial performance and stock price improvement that gold fields peers are beginning to lack when this improvement is realized ie when the south deep mine starts to close in on its nameplate capacity and aisc gold fields has the potential to rapidly close in on its competitors in terms of operating and financial metrics at which point gfi stock can be expected to outperform its peers while it may be years yet until south deep reaches ozyear production i expect the operating metrics to improve drastically next year at the mine in which case gold fields position amongst the gold majors will be reevaluated with plenty of projects in the investment pipeline and a massive reserveresource base at south deep there is little concern for asset depletion at the current rate of production for gold fields competing gold majors such as barrick gold have earned substantial stock price appreciation relative to gold fields due to achieving lower aisc for their operations utilization of asset sales to reduce debt and achieving wider operating margins within the recent gold price spike all of which has increased the financial strength of these companies see resource sector digest hail barrick edition gold fields on the other hand was in less of a position of financial risk at the beginning of the year and continues to suffer from underwhelming operating results leaving little to inspire share price appreciation over the course of the next year or two however times are destined to change gold fields operational and financial performance are bound to stabilize as the remaining complications with south deep are worked
