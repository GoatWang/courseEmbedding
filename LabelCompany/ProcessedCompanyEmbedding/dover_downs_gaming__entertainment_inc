up about me talk restaurants nightlife home services write a review events talk log in     n dupont hwydover de    ive not stayed in the hotel part since i live in dover but ive gone to the casino a few times and i must say great casino clean lots of games slots and tables and out of the few times ive been i won some money on the slots more than ive lost might be my luck but ive walked away with  one time and  another so im loving this casino the ambience is beautiful and it is decorated nicely for each holiday during christmas season they had a huge and gorgeous christmas tree decorated in white ornaments i loved it not dated looking at all theyve got around  different restaurants as well the room was large and clean and the sleets werent cringeworthy the casino was popular with a variety of people of all ages genders and races i find it disheartening that the most racially diverse place ive visited in months is a loud bastion of clanks and clangs which visit luck to few and tragedy to many the breakfast foods lacked quality i am used to in foodie capital pdx the bagels lacked tooth and the breakfast pastries looked costco ish i was sorry to miss the horse racin that might have been more fun than this wasteland my husband did the rusty wallace nascar driving experience it is not cheap but it is very well run and the employees are fun friendly and knowledgeable we had a beautiful day for it too dont go hungry because there is no food available once youre at the track dont pay extra for the go pro video its just audio of the track in front of you as youre driving do bring  extra bucks to buy the official picture they take of you and put in an official looking frame all in all a fun experience i would give this hotel experience  as it was just ok for me i stayed here for two nights and i must say i was soo glad to get home and sleep in my own bed i liked that the hotel offered plenty of parking i ended up getting a spot very close to the hotel when i checked in the staff was nice but seemed very inexperienced about their job the lady asked for my debit card to put a hold on the room and without me realizing she even charged me for my two nights upfront without my authorization then when i told her i wanted to pay in cash they told me i had to wait until the next morning  ughh so the next morning i asked them to reverse the charges so i can pay in cash and they acted like they didnt want to do it overall i ended up having to call my bank and they immediately removed the charges from my account hahaha meanwhile the lady staring at me like a dear in headlights and i sighs so after that fiasco was over i felt much better however i wasnt that impressed by my room although it was spacious and offered great amenities the bathroom to me could of used some remodeling i dont know if it was me but my shower had two heads the handheld and the regular and for some reason the water only worked from the handheld that was in the corner of the shower ughh and the water came out so hard and i cant forget that my hotel room carpet had stains on it now lets get into the casino so the hotel offers a casino and i liked that the entire casino was smoke free and the machines and area was neat and clean however i didnt like that the casino didnt really have a good variety of dining options i just wasnt impressed by any of the restaurants they had to offer plus the food was on the pricey side overall i came for a two day conference which was paid for by my company so i cant get mad at that however i would not come back to stay overnight at this hotel its just not worth it to me possibly the worst service in the history of hospitality stay at a red roof its an improvement i liked dover downs hotel and casino because its a nice conference center without being huge its not ultra plush or a luxury resort but a nice hotel at a casino comparing it to the local resort and convention center at national harbor its a reasonable size as the gaylord at nation harbor is ridiculously big you have to trek a mile to get the the check in counter ask about the nearest bathroom theyll tell you downstairs and across a football field here at dover downs its spacious but everything is in a decent proximity the rooms are between really nice and standard the rooms are currently smoke free but its obvious from the smell embedded in the walls and carpet that it was formerly a hotel that allowed smoking the hotel is aging a bit but its still comfortable i had great sleep dover downs is also located on a strip that has everything from fridays to ruby tuesdays noodles and company olive garden coldstone ice cream and more i didnt visit the shops at the hotel and casino but there are plenty of stores around to suit your needs im not a casino person but i will be back if im offered to go dover downs is a nice destination for a weekend getaway i recently went up for the weekend from the washington dc area and i was pleasantly surprised there is so much to do right there on the grounds that you dont even need to venture out the hotel is nice lots of rooms and clean im not a fan of hotels but when i stayed here i didnt feel apprehensive about it however the hotel is starting to show a little age so with all the money they collect maybe an upgrade is in the works on top of that the casino itself is awesome an entire floor of games that really do pay off from slots to the tables take your pick then when youre ready to take a break you can go to any of the complimentary drink stations or one of the many restaurants that are right off to the side of the casino floor in conclusion i had a lot of fun at dover downs and thats why im a fan community casino free wifi and self serve soft drinks table games and slots always a friendly crowd and never too crowded they have some fun food and shopping options buffet burgers if youre looking for other things i think they do shows regularly too but havent been to one in a while here plenty of parking and lots of shopping and eating nearby need to drive to just alittle update that been meaning to write that everybody at dover downs has been very very nice to me and i just want to thank all the nice girls that work the front desk they really do try to give there customers what they want only thing i want to complain bout is the new check out time which is not there fault not really sure why they changed it i have been told  different stories but in my opinion i think if you are elite card holder you should still get a noon checkout gold and silver cards  check out that way that gives them something to work on to become a black card member that hour makes big deal if you are up playing till  or  in morning i sure hope that the casino doesnt start changing things to much because i would hate to see them lose anymore customers due to the fact so many casinos i live  mins from mdlive casino but i choose to come to dover to play and have fun but i hear a lot of people gonna be going to mgm casino opening on decth i sure hope that it doesnt affect dover casino and people will still come to support a smaller town casino because they do go out and above on a lot of events they give to there card members just like this past weekend the octoberfest they had omg very very nice food was delish and the hats were a cute touch they gave beer mug and took your picture too they had a german band that played the chicken dance lol lol everything was clean and set up beauiful i was also at crabfeast in aug this year very nice affair i wrote review under the festival buffet all in all come to dover downs to have fun and employees know me and i always have a good time when i am there cause you know life too short not to enjoy yourself while you can while everybody is going to mgm i will be spending my free time in dover downs casino i have met so many nice customers that live local and meet up with them when i am there and so many great employees that i love to talk too when i am there too oh and the rooms are always so nice and clean and the maids work hard to keep them that way keep up the good work dover downs and see ya all real soon why is my beef still alive the only thing colder than this was our service avoid the buffet at all costs this review is specifically for the hotel we stayed here for the nascar race and since it is on track property it is very convenient it is a full service hotel and casino with room service a spa fitness center pool restaurants and shopping they need a renovation badly our room was disgusting there were visible stains all over the carpet furniture and walls luckily i had flip flops so i wasnt walking around with my bare feet the beds were highly uncomfortable they only had doubles left so my boyfriend and i shared a bed one night and tried our own beds another night they were so soft and creaked every time you rolled over the shower was not a pleasant experience either its hot or cold and the shower head had the worst spray two stars for convenience proximity to track and room service till am note that this track is in the middle of town and there are plenty of other hotels down the street as well we visit every time we are in dover the casino is cool and fun they serve complimentary sodas there are a few restaurants in the casino security has a strong presence and they are quite nice we had our wedding here and it was an awesome time this is the nicest venue in dover for a big wedding because the resort has everything for a diverse crowd our guests enjoyed the five star restaurant michelles and also all the other restaurants they went to the spa but most importantly they loved that they could gamble at weddings there is often a lot of downtime so that gave them something to do we needed a large space because we had a traditional indian wedding and the ballroom fit the bill we also had the rehearsal dinner in the kent room and that was wonderful the kent room can have up to  people the event coordinator was excellent she was extremely patient in listening to us and accommodating all our needs she was so good in fact that we didnt need to hire a wedding planner this is a great place to bring out of town guests or to stop by on your way down to the beach dover downs is not just a place for nascar its a fun place to gather with friends and family poker room thu  am  tables no players looks very clean smoke free beyond that cant say i stayed overnight at the dover downs hotel  casino on march th for a food show since i booked my reservation at the last minute i almost didnt get a room but the woman in reservations helped me get a room and i got the group rate for being part of the food show this is a great hotel for business purposes my hotel room was huge and included the most comfortable bedding free wifi flat screen tv desk and a huge spalike bathroom with luxurious toiletries the room was very soundproof and i slept like a baby that night the following morning i was able to make my way downstairs for breakfast and i ordered a coffee breakfast sandwich and a fruit cup for under  at sweet perks cafe since i did not have a car i was very grateful to have this cafe onsite so that i did not have to eat from a mediocre buffet or pay  for room service my only complaint was that although the bath towels in my room felt heavenly they left lint everywhere i had lint on my skin in my hair all over my clothes it was a complete mess other than the towels my stay at the dover downs hotel  casino was terrific its nice that this is a nonsmoking facility well organized with self serve drink fountains actually a pretty nice and glowing design for a casino whoa please read before you consider beware for a quick summation awful just make the trip to atlantic city if you are looking for a hotel  casino experience this is not the place at allit is extremely misleading if you go by the website which makes it look beautiful we booked through travelocity which listed terrific amenities and photos made it look like and referred to it as a luxury hotel in reality it is on the side of the road with our view from our upgraded th floor room being that of the shopping center across the street and parking lotsimply put health concerns prevented us from enjoying basics that every decent hotel has the website and everything else promoting this hotel and casino as luxurious on website jacuzzi and poolboth of which were incredibly filthynot just dirty but years of neglect were clear from the pictures you can see the literal ring around the tub the jacuzzi was the size of a regular bathtub so it would be an extremely intimate experience if you dared to go in but honestly it was all foamy from people using it as their personal cleansing bathtub andor no cleaningmaintenance my sister and i literally would not even put our feet in it to see how it felt  we wanted to swim but the pool was only  feet no big deal there but it was small  the size a jacuzzi should be loland it was diiiiiiiiiiirty again  years of neglect moldy i honestly do not know how they stay open due to the health violations the buffet made both my sister and i sick so that had to be from the awful food animals were fighting over crab legs that were dry tasting and since no crackers were given you had to use your hands like a caveman  the gym that smelled of cat spray of all things oddly enough prevented us from our daily workout repulsive again if we knew the hotel was so horrendous i would have booked us at the hilton across the street where we are members of hiltonhonors and even sothinking about it the poorly lit dangerous parking lot and clientele would not even make it worth itwe will never return in fact we are embroiled in a battle to get a refund or at least reduction due to the fact that we were not able to use the jacuzzi pool or gym filth we were absolutely horrified upon pulling up and seeing that this was an outdated filthy building among tj maxx target super cuts etc and most importantly do not risk your health and safety thats the bottom line if we lived closer i dont think id even go it is really that bad i will say one nice thing they have one good machine that my sis and i had a ball with and we had a good laugh about the fact that it was sooooooooo bad we just had to laugh it was sooo outrageous when we were comparing the website pix to the reality it is so dirty and the best part sarcasm dripping off that word best was that upon checkout the supervisor of the desk whatever that means was nasty when we simply asked for our folio bill broken down she simply took out a calculator and showed us  advertised price plus taxes plus  incidentals fee she said you aint got no incidentals so that will fall off  well we shall see if that happens i doubt it my sister is writing to the de department of health and to the board or cfo trying that hard because it was that bad i

cringeworthy the casino was popular with a variety of people of all ages genders and races i find it disheartening that the most racially diverse place ive visited in months is a loud bastion of

ok for me i stayed here for two nights and i must say i was soo glad to get home and sleep in my own bed i liked that the hotel offered plenty of parking i ended up getting a spot very close to the hotel when i checked in the staff was nice but seemed very inexperienced about their job the lady asked for my debit card to put a hold on the room and without me realizing she even charged me for my two nights upfront without my authorization then when i told her i wanted to pay in cash they told me i had to wait until the next morning   ughh so the next morning i asked them to reverse the charges so i can pay in cash and they acted like they didnt want to do it overall i ended up having to call my bank and they immediately removed the charges from my account hahaha meanwhile the lady staring at me like a dear in headlights and i sighsso after that fiasco was over i felt much better however i wasnt that impressed by my room although it was spacious and offered great amenities the bathroom to me could of used some remodeling i dont know if it was me but my shower had two heads the handheld and the regular and for some reason the water only worked from the handheld that was in the corner of the shower ughh and the water came out so hard and i cant forget that my hotel room carpet had stains on it now lets get into the casino so the hotel offers a casino and i liked that the entire casino was smoke free and the machines and area was neat and clean however i  didnt like that the casino didnt really have a good variety of dining options i just wasnt impressed by any of the restaurants they had to offer plus the food was on the pricey sideoverall i came for a two day conference which was paid for by my company so i cant get mad at that however i would not come back to stay overnight at this hotel its just not worth it to me the front entrance the front entrance the hotel food was good check out this pretty dessert strawberry shortcake the hotel food was good check

liked dover downs hotel and casino because its a nice conference center without being huge its not ultra plush or a luxury resort but a nice hotel at a casino  comparing it to the local resort and convention center at national harbor its a reasonable size as the gaylord at nation harbor is ridiculously big  you have to trek a mile to get the the check in counter  ask about the nearest bathroom theyll tell you downstairs and across a football field   here at dover downs its spacious but everything is in a decent proximitythe rooms are between really nice and standard  the rooms are currently smoke free but its obvious from the smell embedded in the walls and carpet that it was formerly a hotel that allowed smoking   the hotel is aging a bit but its still comfortable  i had great sleep dover downs is also located on a strip that has everything from fridays to ruby tuesdays noodles and company olive garden coldstone ice cream and more  i didnt visit the shops at the hotel and casino but there are plenty of stores around to suit your needs  im not a casino person but i will be back if im offered to go was this review … useful  funny  cool  brandon b north bethesda md  friends

the weekend from the washington dc area and i was pleasantly surprised there is so much to do right there on the grounds that you dont even need to venture outthe hotel is nice lots of rooms and clean  im not a fan of hotels but when i stayed here i didnt feel apprehensive about it however the hotel is starting to show a little age so with all the money they collect maybe an upgrade is in the workson top of that the casino itself is awesome an entire floor of games that really do pay off from slots to the tables take your pick  then when youre ready to take a break you can go to any of the complimentary drink stations or one of the many restaurants that are right off to the side of the casino floor in conclusion i had a lot of fun at dover downs and thats why im a fan was this review …

cool  ray l glen burnie md  friends  reviews  photos elite ’ share review embed review compliment send message follow ray l stop following ray l  updated review just alittle update that been meaning to write that everybody at dover downs has been very very nice to me and i just want to thank all the nice girls that work the front desk they really do try to give there customers what they want only thing i want to complain bout is the new check out time which is not there fault not really sure why they changed it i have been told  different stories but in my opinion i think if you are elite card holder you should still get a noon checkout gold and silver cards  check out that way that gives them something to work on to become a black card member that hour makes big deal if you are up playing till  or  in morning i sure hope that the casino doesnt start changing things to much because i would hate to see them lose anymore customers due to the fact so many casinos i live  mins from mdlive casino but i choose to come to dover to play and have fun but i hear a lot of people gonna be going to mgm casino opening on decth i sure hope that it doesnt affect dover casino and people will still come to support a smaller town casino because they do go out and above on a lot of events they give to there card members just like this past weekend the octoberfest they had omg very very nice food was delish and the hats were a cute touch they gave beer mug and took your picture too they had a german band that played the chicken dance lol lol everything was clean and set up beauiful i was also
