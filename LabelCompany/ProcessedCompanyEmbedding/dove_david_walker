his outrage you see most of the slave narratives were edited by or dictated to abolitionists who then used them as testimony to the cause i had been struck by the contrast between the extreme brutality of the experiences and the calm almost detached tone of the author’s delivery part of the inspiration for my poems was grounded in a compulsion to capture this eerie and deliberate projection of objectivity   and then came david walker a free negro who would not be polite who could read and write and was therefore not obliged to filter his emotions through the transcriptions from wellmeaning but politically motivated abolitionists — he could write his own appeal arrange for its printing and dissemination in order to convey a sense of the agitation that propelled his articulate treatise the poem’s narrative is constantly being interrupted — by observations by walker’s own thoughts his rage and anguish is palpable in his prose and in my poem i strive to replicate syllable by syllable the deep measure of his emotional turmoil   david walker – free to travel he still couldn’t be shown how lucky he was they strip and beat and drag us about like rattlesnakes home

linings of itinerant seamen jackets ringwormed with salt traded drunkenly to pursers in the carolinas pamphlets ripped out read aloud men of colour who are also of sense outrage incredulity uproar in state legislatures   we are the most wretched degraded and abject set of beings that ever lived since the world began the jewelled canaries in the lecture halls tittered pressed his dark hand between their gloves every halfstep was no step at all every morning the man on the corner strung a fresh bunch of boots from his shoulders “i’m happy” he said “i never want to live any better or happier than when i can get aplenty of boots and shoes to clean”   a second edition a third the abolitionist press is perfectly appalled humanity kindness and the fear of the lord does not consist in protecting
