boss gary klein’s original  fishing skirts   menu boss gary klein’s original this is what started it all the original flipping jig own your own piece of history this is the jig that gary klein designed more than  years ago many anglers have said that this design changed everything the oval shaped head design in the closed mouth of a bass almost always creates up right hook rotation during the exit which leads to a higher percent of hook ups in the upper part of the mouth the flat eye allowed gary to create a perfect smooth transition from the line to the knot to the bottom side of the jig this design made a jig that an angler could fish in the heaviest of cover sizes  oz  hook  oz  hook  oz  hook and  oz  hook  mustad heavy wire ultrapoint hooks  per pack default sorting sort by

bottom side of jig   head design that will upright itself on hook set    my personal round bend needle point hook design    painted with the highest quality paint   top grade weed guard all jigs are not created equal in fact most anglers do not realize just how versatile they really are lets take a look at my gk flip jig this jig was designed to be fished with a flipping stick using heavy line in thick cover if you look at the jig head you will notice the weight being distributed behind the eye of the hook the recessed line tie allows the jig to be fished in heavy cover with out getting hung up the jig’s head design creates an upright rotation upon hook set this leads to a high percentage of hook ups in the upper part of the fish’s mouth the hook that is used in this jig is my personal round bend needle point  hook design this hook is only available in the boss jig line i have put a lot of time into designing this jig and hope it improves your day on the water  gary klein default

began in the s in  the company was purchased by the trek bicycle corporation and the original klein factory at chehalis washington closed in  as production moved to the trek headquarters at waterloo wisconsin widespread distribution in the united states stopped in  and ceased altogether in the rest of the world in  contents  history  innovations  techniques  models  sponsored teams  notes  references  external links historyedit seat tube badge on a klein quantum gary klein born  june   age  attended the university of california at davis before transferring to the massachusetts institute of technology mit during the independent activities period in  a group of students including klein worked together under professor buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle after analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames and examining ones that had broken in use they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing the students chose to construct frames from  aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube alternatives such as the stronger  aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions after graduating from mit in  with a degree in chemical engineering klein took a business course for entrepreneurs as a keen road racer in  he started a business project with three other people and built a limited run of aluminum alloy framed bikes at the mit innovation center using a us grant provided by mit and us of capital from each partner the prototypes with larger diameter tubes and thinner walls than those produced in  were displayed at the international cycle show in new york in february  a klein adroit in burgundy blue the next year he relocated to some disused buildings on his parents farm in san martin california that had previously been used for dehydrating prunes in  he patented use of large diameter aluminum alloy tubes to increase stiffness and in  he moved from san jose california to chehalis washington he started production runs of road bicycles in the early s and mountain bikes in the mid s while kleins use of aluminium for a bicycle frames was not entirely novel his use of large diameter tubes wasnote  aluminium alloys have a youngs modulus around a third that of steel but with thicker tubes he was able to make a bicycle that weighed around  less than a conventional model in  trek bought klein bikes after klein found it hard to compete without the sales network of a larger company in place at its peak around  people worked at the chehalis plant but operation gradually moved to the main trek factory in wisconsin in  a workforce of around  people produced  to  frames a year in  all production moved to the trek headquarters at waterloo wisconsin bikes were still sold under the klein name until around  in japan but widespread distribution ceased circa  in the united states a green klein mountain bike can be seen hanging on the wall in jerry seinfelds apartment in the television show seinfeld innovationsedit rear triangle of a klein mantra the bottom bracket and suspension pivot of a klein adept comp some offroad models featured two designs of onepiece welded stembar combination marketed as mission control mc that eliminated clamping bolts and excess material the original version mc used a quill stem and required a  inch  mm threaded steerer mc used a locknut tightening against a collet that sat between the fork steerer and the stem and a special eight pointed wrench was required to remove it the steerer had to be cut to the correct length in order to adjust the height of the stem mc was a third version that was only the stem thus the handlebar was not welded klein held a patent us   for an improved method of routing cables through the frame of a bicycle that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the framenote  the front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube and the rear brake cable through the top tube although some models changed in  to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with shimano components in the  model year klein replaced  aluminium alloy with a new alloy called zr  that used zirconium in place of chromium the new alloy had not been assigned an industry number and it was named after the unused  series advertised improvements included a  grams  oz decrease in weight per frame and a fatigue life five times longer than the  model year frames techniquesedit klein bicycles were famous for their paintwork and offered a large number of custom colours and patterns the paint used was a durethane enamel nonmetallic paint that cost up to us per gallon the klein logo was debossed into the frame by painting the frame in the colour of the logo then applying a mask and painting the pattern beginning with the mc frames klein used gradient tubing where the wall thickness varied along the length and diameter of the tube highly manipulated chainstays on mountain bikes allowed a tighter rear triangle to accommodate large offroad tyres and facilitated efficient transfer of power welded aluminium needed heat treating to restore strength lost in welding after the treatment frames were required to be aligned to within  inches  mm on all alignment surfaces and were then machined to within  inches  mm modelsedit klein produced both mountain bikes and
