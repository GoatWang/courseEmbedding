security companies we have reviewed over  people have shared their experience here with vivint and on average those people have said their experience was roughly a  the bottom line if you’re looking for a home security company that offers several automation features and remote system control vivint is a good option to consider however keep in mind that the company’s contract is lengthy and its rates are higher than many of its competitors the big thing to watch out for with vivint are the customer reviews with so many of them being negative it’s worth taking the time to research other

july th  newnan ga  people found this review helpful our salesperson was very intrusive and pushy the first mistake was him showing up at our home at pm since we were already searching for a security system and our neighbors gave him recommendations on our community facebook page we decided to give him the benefit of the doubt we signed and agreed to choose vivent since the deal seemed reasonable however if its too good to be true then it usually is in hindsight our salesman was dishonest and witheld important information regarding the contract loan what really raised suspicion is that the install guy just so happened to “be in the area” and was able to come and “install right away” most places you have to schedule right i truly believe that the install guy was probably following the salesman around waiting on a sale during the time of the installation i decided to research the company i know that you’ll see good bad reviews with most companies but vivint was horrible aside from checking the reviews on their facebook page they had bad reviews with bbb yelp rip off report and even  launched an investigation on the company at this point it was  at night we had the install guy stop everything and come back the next day i immediately called to cancel our “ day trial” in which i’m hoping we’ll get our money refunded to uscontrary to what the reviews state thankfully we got out before we were locked into this nightmare of a company please train your salespeople to properly and honestly explained the contract and other perks also please please have them to stop using scare tactics in order to make sales it’s not good for a business was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  odalys berrens july th   people found this review

him i was not going to pay for my system to be monitored he told me i would not have to pay for the update there was no cost i did have to sign the tablet to authorize installation i guess that was when he slipped the contract in he assured me i would not be charged a monitoring fee well they have drafted three payments out of my checking account i have called numerous times and been “passed

change our mind and to just let him know and he would come and take care of it for us he also mentioned that since my husband is in the military that we can cancel at any time well my husband and i changed our mind and i texted the sales guy first thing the next morning june   and told him we decided to cancel and he kept putting us off for days he assured us that he scheduled a tech to come out that next thursday to take the alarm system out i kept all of the text messages for proof after about  days we could no longer reach the sales guy so i decided to call vivant myself when i called i was told that there was never a request to uninstall my system or to cancel i then discovered that we were supposed to submit a cancellation notice paper that he left us before three days before they could cancel and that since it was way past the three days i could not cancel my contract i was completely lied to by the sales jerk by telling me that he would take care of it for me i did also discover that he did not tell me the whole truth about military being cancelled at any time the rest of the truth is it is only if you are deployed i threatened to sue their company after them refusing to cancel my policy and for lieing about everything i asked to speak to a manager and explained that i had text messages between me and the sales guy of my request to cancel multiple times her name was kierra r and she informed me that they would honor the text messages for proof of my request to cancel i sent screenshots of all of the texts and emailed a request to cancel my policy as requested immediately a appointment was scheduled to remove the alarm system later that month i was assured my account would be cancelled so i didn’t think about it anymore vivant came and removed the alarm system and left a mess but i didn’t notice until later that they left their sign in our yard on july th i was pissed when they took money out of my account the following month even though i was assured it was cancelled i called vivant again on july th and was told that the notes showed that they explained to me that they could not cancel my account i was furious and demanded to talk to a manager but she said since it was a holiday they were not available i called back july th and requested to speak to a manager and was told again that they will not cancel my policy i called yet again a couple of days later and was told by a manager that he apologizes for the inconvenience and will manually cancel my policy and refund all of my money within the next  business days well after all of the lies i was really having a hard time believing this was cancelled  days went by and there was not a refund or cancellation confirmation as informed there would be i then called again and was told that that person does not exist and that they will not be able to cancel my policy the text messages were not good enough i was lied yet again i am beyond frustrated and this company will not get away this i have all of the proof i need to cancel my contract and refund all of my money i filed a complaint with the attorney general in arkansas and now am leaving one here as well hoping this will do

cameras are very low grade plastic and blow in the wind they are highly variable when it comes to detection we had a theft in our driveway today  my vehicle was detected leaving and then at  detected returning in between the building materials are missing as evidenced by the camera clips however the camera did not pick anyone up removing them although the camera settings according to vivint should have when asked what their policy was – it was simple we have no liability it is technology and it is bound to fail sometimes best of luck with a company that behaves like this horrible just put up your kids toy cameras and buy the sign fro them which took me asking three times to get one was this review helpful yes share get embed code share review read more user score  todd dreeszen july th  ocala fl  people found this review helpful on the th of june  i made a call to vivint inquiring about a camera security system the representative gathered information about reasoning for needing security cameras after recommending their system i began gathering information about their products he stated that i would likely need  cameras that he said were p hd with night vision the top of the line they offered and covered around  degrees each one camera for the front one camera for the back and one dedicated to our “problem” area this area was a renter who had pointed a gun at me the previous day and when the police showed i had no witness’s or video so he informed me that it was going to be a yr contract and he needed to charge my debit card that night for around  to cover the installation no problem right after all you want your life and family protected for longer than  years right so on the morning of the th the tech shows up to install i go over where i would like the cameras installed with the tech and asked for his recommendation as well since he does do this for a living at this time he informs me there is going to be significant gaps in video coverage i’m confused so i ask to explain to me these gaps he tells me that since the cameras only cover about  to  degrees each i’m going to have a lot of dead space woah… strike   i ask him to get his manager on the phone now oh btw we have been with adt for  years before the th of june and cancelled on the th vivint offered financing and adt didn’t so we are in a bit of a pickle no security active at this point the tech’s manager authorized an additional “doorbell camera” to be added to cover some of the dead space doorbell camera covers about  degrees with a fishbowl appearance through the camera five hours later the three outdoor cameras and the doorbell camera are installed and activated couldn’t get worse right while i’m esigning the contract i read the satisfaction policy it states that i have  days to evaluate the system and if for any reason i’m not happy call for a refund and the contract will be null and void heck no i said you better get your manager on the phone and give me a  day return policy or you can start taking your equipment down from my house manager says “i’ll go ahead an annotate it here in the record that i authorized a  day return policy” not happening i said you send me an email right now or i’m not signing a thing more well  minutes later i have an email extending my return it’s called and ror for  days use that term and people will listen when they are installing or trying to sell you something note to the buyer you better have the best fastest wifi available or you will be me as well i have cox which has the fastest speed available meg down meg up this system needs upload speed every camera requires a minimum of meg upload speed all cameras are wireless hardwired for power and wifi for data transmission the very first night we had issues with the cameras dropping off line without us knowing about it we had to call the next day and set an appointment for them to come back out to try and fix the brand new system out of the box  days later the same tech comes out and puts in a single signal booster in attempt to attain the required signal strength  btw this is found on your in lcd control panel the tech was unable to get the necessary signal strength after multiple attempts that afternoon btw we have a  bedroom  bath single story regular pitch house nothing crazy so the tech said he doesn’t know what to do he has done everything he can so we had to call back to set another appointment up two days later on the next appointment time am the tech doesn’t show doesn’t call nothing i have to call them now they tell me it’s going to be another  days before they can get the next tech out during this time we evaluate our coverage’s and conclude we will need another  cameras to cover the dead spots someone was able to get under one of our cameras and have a cigarette and blow smoke to the camera during night vision the next tech shows up assess the situation installs  more cameras and another booster and the system appears to be working with all cameras above the required  yeah…right we had multiple cameras go offline over the week end without us knowing the system comes with video clips that it stores when the cameras detects motion within the areas you set up well we would have no footage for hours at a time during the night and day so we had to set up another appointment and guess what happened they no called no showed us again i was talking to them on one line and my wife was calling them to cancel on the other line we agreed to have one more person come out and try to fix it he arrived and attempted to fix it by changing out the control panel as well as remove their wireless router that was running thru our wireless router made no sense and was successful in attaining meg upload speed from the control panel at this point we initiated the cancellation with the service tech while he was on speaker phone with the ror department manager make sure you do this so the manager can send an email to me validating the cancellation was received and the appointment was made by them to come get the equipment and no further action was required by myself other to be at my house for them to come pick up the equipment when the date came for the appointment to pick up their equipment they didn’t show i called them at  and told them they didn’t show and the equipment was mine i had a phone call  later by a tech that said “i was in the neighborhood and wasn’t supposed to be there till tomorrow but i can be there in  minutes” conclusion – system’s concept is awesome cameras when they worked were very good night vision was ok but still rate them good function was good except the system can’t be viewed on “playback” your reviewing continues footage from the previous time period of your choice from anything but your mobile device doorbell camera was great in quality and function only one that never lost connection to this day i’m still waiting for our refund the absolute worst customer service by virtue of the division of labor no one department can help you with the other when you are transferred in starts you in the q for another department my average was hr mins every time i called with my longest being  while trouble shooting the system if you have no problem dealing with this for  yrs or you can drop over  upfront and incur a  yr contract and own cameras that drop off line every
