stanley black  decker plans to build on iconic craftsman brand by chris marshall • may  0 print print on march  stanley black  decker successfully completed its purchase of the craftsman brand from sears holdings corporation for a net present value of approximately 00 million in cash this acquisition gives stanley black  decker the right to develop manufacture and sell craftsmanbranded products outside the sears holdings and sears hometown  outlet stores distribution channels “we are pleased to complete the purchase of the craftsman brand a legendary american brand with tremendous consumer awareness built on a legacy of providing reliable products at a good value and standing behind them” says james m loree stanley black  decker’s president and chief executive officer immediately upon acquisition stanley black  decker intended to begin broadening craftsman’s product availability to its customers but announced that the process “would take some time” to that end “our efforts are now focused on supply chain activities to initially support sales into nonsears holding channels” loree says “we are developing commercial strategies for the brand and remain very excited about the potential growth opportunities we continue to see a clear path towards annual growth of approximately 00 million a year for the next decade” for loyal and longtime craftsman customers this change of ownership surely brings questions to mind to that end a march  news release from stanley black  decker has provided a number of answers that ezine readers might find helpful to know for your convenience we offer a sampling of them here will sears continue to sell craftsman products and will the craftsman warranty remain the same stanley reports that sears will continue sourcing marketing and selling craftsmanbranded products in their stores independently from stanley black  decker further craftsman branded products will continue to be covered under their existing warranties why did stanley black  decker purchase craftsman  stanley black  decker believes craftsman’s rich history high consumer awareness and loyal following adds to stanley black  decker’s breadth of brands and can provide even more solutions to customers the company also intends to “bring innovation and investment back to craftsman making it stronger than ever before” will craftsman’s product line remain the same stanley black  decker reports that while it will remain focused on cost quality and delivery of solutions to customers at the highest standards “we are confident that there is an opportunity to build upon craftsman’s heritage as an iconic american brand that stands for high quality valueoriented products” will craftsman products be manufactured in the united states stanley black  decker intends to localize as much manufacturing as possible focusing on us manufacturing with global materials with the confidence that this will help to grow the craftsman brand “there’s a lot of excitement and positive energy around our stated intention of bringing manufacturing for the craftsman brand back to the united states” loree stated recently to investors “our plans for a new stateoftheart manufacturing facility are starting to take shape” learn more about stanley black  decker’s purchase of craftsman by clicking here posted in industry interviewscraftsman stanley black

sustainably made wooden watches and fashion accessories torontobased company offers contemporary wooden watch sunglasses and accent jewelry items replants trees with each sale ofbg whether or not sears continues to carry craftsman may be a moot as so many sears locations are closing ace hardware currently carries craftsman as well didn’t see that mentioned will it continue what other retailers is stanleybd considering the big box stores have their own labels like kobalt at lowe’s but carry stanley and bd would craftsman be a conflict paul so good to see i’ve never had a problem with a craftsman tool or a black  decker one either oldcardinal hope they will be made in usa if not they will go the way of other pieces of junk from china bob stanley craftsman and black  decker’s quality has undoubtedly gone down hill with new ownerships in the past lets hope they get back to the quality and pride that was intended by the men that started these industries time will tell vorant so what are they going to do rebrand “harbor freight” quality tools and sell as craftsman lets face it stanley black and decker’s own quality has slipped into chinese manufactured junk vorant more us manufacturing don’t hold your breath… chrisb i would think that if they brought the manufacturing back to the us or wherever that it would be pretty much automated that would leave the jobs to be had in support of those operations more important are they going to stand behind those products like the original craftsman brand even that warranty has been slipping as time goes on one of the things i have liked about the craftsman tool brand is that they are accessible the tools aren’t the absolute best but if you had a problem you could go to a local sears store and negotiate a replacement hopefully the new owners will stand up to that reputation chris dah0 if i’m not mistaken stanley black and decker also purchased delta tool line a few years back and that brand has almost disappeared off the market  hopefully they’ll do a better job with the craftsman line  come to think of it i haven’t purchased a black and decker power tool in many many years do they even make power tools under that name anymore you might also like taylor taylor makes worthy worthy strainers zinsser the sultan of shellac helps polish its image old brown glue “boutique” hide glue new rockler dust right®
