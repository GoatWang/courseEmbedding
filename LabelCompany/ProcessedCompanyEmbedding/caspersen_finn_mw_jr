shore and jupiter island florida on labor day morning last year while the rest of the country was wondering whether to spend the final day of summer lying on the beach or firing up the grill finn m w caspersen the immensely wealthy yearold former chairman and ceo of the beneficial corporation had other things on his mindhe said goodbye to barbara his wife of  years around  am at their squarefoot waterfront estate on three acres on a peninsula in westerly rhode island then he drove his green fourdoor  mercedes the mile or so to the office he shared with fred whittemore a retired morgan stanley partner and robert mccormack a former morgan stanley colleague of whittemore’s and a founder of trident capital a venturecapital firm caspersen whittemore and mccormack were all wealthy and semiretired and they occupied their time with making sure their money was well invested the westerly office was more or less their clubhouse “we used to laugh we had the office in order to have a place for phone calls without having to upset our wives” whittemore says the small gray shingled building was next to the relatively new  million shelter harbor golf club which the three men along with four other founding partners had conceived and builtoddly caspersen had not the slightest interest in golf and never played his passions ran instead to the more esoteric sports of olympiclevel horse jumping fourinhand horsedrawncarriage driving and competitive rowing the princeton national rowing association’s finn m w caspersen rowing center is named for him thanks to his generous donation during caspersen’s year reign as the driving force behind the us equestrian team from  to  american riders and drivers earned  medals including  gold in the olympics world championships and pan american gamescaspersen was also a major contributor to any number of prominent new jersey politicians mostly republicans including former governors thomas kean and christie todd whitman and also kean’s son thomas kean jr currently a state senator in  caspersen and his wife donated  to political campaigns making them the eighthlargest political donors in the us that year according to mother jones magazine finn had also opened his considerable checkbook to such institutions as the peddie prep school whose wealthy alumni include former us ambassador to the court of st james’s walter annenberg and finn himself drew university and harvard law school to which he gave  million making him the single largest donor to the schoolhe was also an ardent conservationist and when the opportunity arose to buy some  acres of undeveloped land in westerly from narragansett electric at the turn of the millennium caspersen and his partners pounced on it in order to prevent a developer from building  homes there they paid  million for the parcel “we did it in wall street fashion” whittemore recalls “we put together an llc and we got the government to pat them narragansett electric on the fanny to reduce the price by about a million” then they signed up around  members—who paid between  and  each—and donated a conservation easement to the weekapaug foundation for conservation whittemore and mccormack were founders and important financial backers of the foundation and caspersen was its chairman until shortly before his death whittemore says the club founders took a  tax deduction and signed an agreement not to develop homes around the golf course they also took out a loan of around  million from a local bank to add to the money they had raised to build the course a clubhouse and other buildings they hired michael hurdzan of hurdzanfry environmental golf design to design the course he is the only golfcourse architect in america with a doctorate in plant science “we did it with an environmental bent” explains richard anthony who worked for caspersen to get the club off the ground the clubhouse opened in july  and the hole course was completed in early around  am on labor day whittemore saw caspersen at their office where whittemore was meeting with an architect he had hired to renovate a building a few days before caspersen had sent five or six suits to the cleaners and asked whittemore to sign a document that made him a trustee of caspersen’s living will“he was very cheery in his usual way” whittemore says of caspersen whom he would often see at his desk looking at his computer screen he was “obsessed with all the details he could find out on the computer” as are so many people whittemore remembers unbeknownst to whittemore caspersen had brought with him to the office a bluedsteel caliber fiveshot smith  wesson revolver which he usually kept in a suitcase in a closet in the master bedroom of his house caspersen had an impressive collection of antique guns but the smith  wesson revolver wasn’t one of themsoon whittemore left the office with the architect by  caspersen had also left after sending his wife a text message to say he would be coming home after stopping by the reservoir near the golf course which he explained “they are talking about enlarging” two or three days earlier caspersen had asked the golf club’s general manager gerard o’callaghan for the keys to the lock on the fence surrounding the reservoir then at  finn texted his wife “at reservoir love you am going home”unsettled barbara caspersen noticed that the revolver was missing she tried her husband’s cell phone but got no answer she called  and told the police that her husband’s car was at the post road office and urged the officers to go there the police got no answer from finn’s cell phone either when they arrived at the office building they saw his mercedes parked in the driveway and drew their service weapons the mercedes was unlocked and nothing unusual was inside by this time barbara had arrived at the building and expressed concern “about where her husband was and his state of mind” according to edward st clair captain in the westerly police department she explained he was on medication for an increasingly lifethreatening array of health problems later after talking to dr bernard davidoff an internist from morristown new jersey the police established that caspersen had “suffered from severe depression and was taking antidepressant meds heart meds liver meds kidney meds and diabetes meds” they entered the building and checked the office caspersen wasn’t therethe canine unit was summoned to see if a scent could be picked up the officers began to fan out from the office toward the golf course they figured caspersen could not have gotten too far on foot since his various ailments and chemotherapy treatments for cancer had severely hobbled him in recent years “he couldn’t stand up for very long” whittemore says “he couldn’t walk very far” when he would have dinner at the shinglestyle clubhouse or go there to visit the extensive wine cellar he would be dropped off at the front entrance rather than walk from the parked caras the police were making their way to the edge of the golf course by the reservoir they saw gerard o’callaghan motioning to them to come to a small pump house when o’callaghan had heard that caspersen was missing he remembered about the reservoirfence key and went looking for him by the water “we immediately went over and saw finn caspersen lying on the ground area next to a large green generator” patrolman christian fiore recalls in the police report it was  pmcaspersen was wearing a white checked dress shirt a blueandred vest gray dress pants with pinkandblue suspenders and brown penny loafers with no socks according to the police report there was “severe trauma” to the back of his head his upper torso was lying on rocks and against an aluminum ladder his left arm with a closed fist lay across his chest and his right arm was extended outward also with a closed fistthe smith  wesson revolver was under his right footone shot had been fired leaving four bullets in the gun the detectives determined that caspersen had been sitting on the ground when he shot himself in the head “on his person” st clair says the police found his blackberry his driver’s license and  in cash there was a handwritten note in the pocket of his dress shirt according to the police the note said that caspersen “was tired diminished and in constant pain and that he did not want to be a burden to his loving family”beneficial corporation coo david farris with caspersen then chairman of the board in  by jack s kanthalthe starledger back at the office the police offered barbara their condolences as well as any services she might need which she declined later that day at her house she told police that her husband had been dealing with many medical and personal problemsa member of the westerly ambulance corps pronounced caspersen dead at  pm his body was taken to the medical examiner’s office at  pm after an autopsy the cause of death was determined to have been “a gunshot wound to the head and the manner of death was suicide selfinflicted” according to st clair but many other mysteries about caspersen’s death remain decidedly unresolvedone of the secrets that finn caspersen kept from his friends was that he was born jewish proudly norwegian caspersen’s father olaus westby caspersen emigrated from risør norway in  and settled in weehawken new jersey olaus’s wife freda resika caspersen was born in the united states the daughter of jewish immigrants from eastern europe together they had two sons finn and john who became a doctorolaus first supported himself and his family by working at a series of odd jobs—in a stable in a grocery store—then served in the military during world war i and became a naturalized american citizen in after the war olaus went to night school to earn a ba from pace college while working as a stenographer at a company owned by the rockefellers in  hoping to set his career on a higher trajectory he joined the beneficial loan society to work for “colonel” clarence hodson who had founded the business in elizabeth new jersey in  the firm made small loans to consumers and growing businesses around  it invented what would become known as the subprime mortgagefreda was not religious but olaus thought it important for the family to have a religious affiliation so finn and his brother were raised protestant “being protestant was important” caspersen once said in an interview in the promise fulfilled a book about norwegian immigrants to the united states that he helped underwrite “there was a kind of anticatholicism in the family”by  hodson and olaus had formed beneficial finance corporation by consolidating three separate businesses into one business boomed in  olaus’s salary—published in the new york times—was  he would spend  years at beneficial  as president along with being a successful businessman he was a philanthropist among other activities he was on the board of the peddie school to which he gave a science building since replaced by a new one made possible by walter annenberg’s  million donation which finn caspersen helped to make happenthe caspersens eventually moved to andover new jersey and venice florida finn went to the peddie school then brown university and harvard law school during this period he met barbara warden morris an undergraduate at wellesley college they were married in in  caspersen started in the law department at beneficial then moved over to the business side “and climbed up the corporate ladder” he once said by then beneficial had grown to  offices in  states and three foreign countries with total assets of nearly  billion in  he became ceo after the previous one died “it was a combination of luck and ability” he said he was  years oldin  caspersen purchased the acre harbour island in downtown tampa florida and began to transform it into an upscale residential community when he broke ground on the project in  he invited former president gerald ford to hit a golf ball across garrison channel to downtown tampa to show potential property owners just how close the island was to the business district a grateful local newspaper once referred to him as “prince caspersen”in  caspersen sold beneficial to household international for household stock worth  billion the stock deal made caspersen fabulously wealthy he and his family walked away with almost  million in assets in addition caspersen controlled another  million through various trusts that had owned beneficial stock to invest and diversify the  billion he formed and devoted himself fulltime to knickerbocker management—named after the highwasp allmale temple the knickerbocker club on fifth avenue of which he was a membermourners at caspersen’s memorial service at morristown’s st peter’s episcopal church by kevin coughlinthe starledger eight days after caspersen committed suicide and a year to the day after lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy and the molten lava of the financial crisis spewed across the globe some  of caspersen’s friends and relatives filed on a cloudless afternoon into the stately st peter’s episcopal church in morristown new jersey in the heart of the state’s ritzy and underappreciated horse country the caspersens had had homes in the area in both andover and bernardsville a bernardsville resident recalled that the house there was “quite a palace”by this time the hyperefficient barbara had already cleaned out her husband’s office in hobe sound florida across the bridge from their jupiter island home the family had also apparently orchestrated a finn caspersen media strategy—to wit after the initial reverential stories no one should speak to the press at the memorial service the four sons rowers and harvard law school grads all—finn m w junior samuel m w erik m w and andrew w w—spoke and tom kean gave the eulogy in his minute talk kean recalled “when finn wanted to help you he could get other people to come along he had a wonderful decisive quality so if he was onto a project or a person he got other people to come along he could motivate others and that’s a wonderful wonderful quality”caspersen with princess anne at an international equestrian federation meeting in tampa mids by nancy jaffer and then kean recalled there was the time he was in london with caspersen in the name of all things equestrian caspersen urged kean to “ride with” him to windsor castle because “he had some friends out there” clearly still quite astonished at the memory kean remarked “who do i meet in windsor well his friend prince philip and his wife the queen of england and we ended as you remember barbara going to chapel with the queen or the queen mother the next morning finn had incredible friends”kean could also have mentioned that in  caspersen had driven him his wife and the byrnes brendan byrne was the outgoing governor to an inauguration party in a fourhorse carriage finn was in full period costume including black tie and top hat it was something out of “a currier  ives print” recalls lawrence bathgate ii a new jersey attorney and the kean inaugural cochairother friends and acquaintances shared memories online the most revealing of which perhaps came from a retired marketing consultant charlie leck who had known finn through the horse world and served with him on the board of the new york coaching club“though finn was enormously successful in many ways and had achieved great wealth and prominence he wasn’t a bold and confident character” wrote leck “he was always hesitant in conversation and seemed nervous about engaging with people he didn’t know well he liked his cocktails a great deal and talking with him became easier as he loosened himself up however very few people were ever going to get to know him very deeply he had built up a strong defense system over the years and he was only going to let you glance at the surfaces of his character”barbara caspersen following the memorial service for her husband on september  in morristown new jersey by kevin coughlinthe starledgerafter the memorial service wearing an elegant black jacket a double strand of pearls and gold earrings barbara accepted condolences from the many mourners who had lined up to pay their respects at one point she pulled fred whittemore aside and pointed to her husband’s ashes which were in the middle of the church “that’s the end of the living will” she said whittemore like nearly everyone else wondered what had gone so terribly wrong with their friend to cause him to end his life in such a sudden and inexplicable wayin truth the signs of caspersen’s deep financial emotional and physical troubles had been building for months if not years first there was his deteriorating health he had “severe” kidney cancer according to whittemore and had to go for regular chemotherapy treatments caspersen told him “i have either  months to live or  years and i don’t know which” whittemore recalls that the treatments left caspersen severely weakened “when he went to a party he couldn’t stand up” whittemore says “and he would go sit on the sidelines and someone would come over and talk to him and we’d all go do that while barbara worked the room the way active wives do” the uncertainty about his health led to depression and he would sometimes nod off in the middle of conversations “finn was really sort of horrified about his medical outcome” whittemore recallscaspersen in groom’s livery with his fourinhand rig and competition driver bill long in  by nancy jaffer last summer caspersen resigned his position as chairman of the weekapaug foundation and the caspersens put their westerly estate and nearby land on the market for  million “one of southern new england’s finest waterfront compounds” boasted the realestate literature about the estate caspersen also sold his interest in the westerly office buildingcaspersen resigned from the hodson trust created to benefit four maryland colleges and as chairman of the board of peddie he also left his position as chairman of the dean’s advisory board at harvard law school and there were rumors the caspersens were selling their big house in new jersey and moving into a condominium which is also said to be on the marketcaspersen’s recent withdrawal from jupiter island also caught people’s attention jupiter island a barrier island north of palm beach might be the most exclusive enclave of all it has one of the highest per capita incomes of any place in the united states oilandmineral heir joseph reed and his socialite wife permelia had bought most of the property on jupiter island in  for a song and turned it into what meryl gordon in her  book mrs astor regrets called “an exclusive wasp retreat” permelia a source says would send a black sweater to a resident she had tired of with the following note attached “perhaps you can use this back north” gordon also wrote that ms reed “was famous as a social arbiter and for being shamelessly antisemitic”one of the newer jupiter island residents denies there is any remaining overt antisemitism on the island but adds “if you were jewish and you cared about being jewish why would you ever move up here from palm beach”there are only some  homes on the island among the past and present residents are george h w bush former publisher and former mets owner nelson doubleday and tiger woods who paid  million for a acre site that runs from the intracoastal waterway to the atlantic ocean in september  the caspersens paid  million for a home on one acre overlooking the exclusive jupiter island club and with views farther east to the atlantic ocean in  caspersen won a seat on the jupiter island town commission and he showed that he cared particularly about limiting development on the island and conservation and burying phone and cable wiresin march  caspersen ran unopposed for reelection but barely five months later he changed his mind on august  the caspersens sent an email to many of the residents of jupiter island informing them that they had decided to put their home and their guesthouse on the market “we have reached a point in our lives where it makes sense to ‘downsize’ and to lessen our responsibilities for managing and caring for so many properties in so many states” their message saidthat same day there was a threeandahalfhour meeting of the jupiter island town commission caspersen who participated by phone spoke up to say that “as some of you may know” he had put his house on the market “for personal reasons” and that he did not feel it was “appropriate” to continue serving on the board since he was clearly now just a “shortterm” resident “so at the end of this meeting i will tender my resignation immediately” he did not elaborate other than to say “i regret deeply having to do this—but circumstances require it” his fellow commissioners were stunned including anne o’laughlin scott who said “i am speechless i am so sorry this is happening” caspersen responded “as am i”two days after caspersen’s death george andreassi a reporter at the stuart newsport st lucie news wrote a story quoting jupiter island resident nathaniel reed son of joseph and permelia as saying that caspersen had serious financial problems “he was not well and then experienced this unbelievable financial situation” he said “obviously the combination must have been of critical importance in his decision a suicide of a friend is totally devastating the financial distress of a friend is equally disturbing” this was a shocking twist to many people what was reed talking about how could a hugely wealthy philanthropist have had financial problems reed is “king of the island because his mom built the place but i didn’t know that nathaniel and finn were even close” says one resident “that surprised me like hell one’s the old money without money reed and the other is new money with money” or so people had thoughtcaspersen and his wife at shelter harbor golf club in  from the starledger nowadays reed who is finishing up a book about the island isn’t talking so much about caspersen “mrs caspersen dear lady has asked everybody not to be quoted on finn” he says in the days after her husband’s death she made a beeline for the knickerbocker building in hobe sound to clean out her husband’s office as quickly as she could some employees at the office didn’t even know caspersen had been ill caspersen’s office furniture and other effects were put up for sale and much of the staff was let go at one point a visitor noticed that there was a large portrait of caspersen in his office—“who goes into their office every day and has a portrait of themselves on the wall” this person wonders—and then was amazed when one of the remaining employees looked at the portrait and said “i’m still mad at you” adds the visitor “it’s a weird scene over there”the day after the memorial service the new york times weighed in citing an unnamed source reporter lynnley browning wrote that caspersen “was suspected of dodging many millions in federal taxes” and “the authorities it seemed were closing in” she wrote that they “asserted he might have owed as much as  million in back taxes and fines or possibly even have faced prison” and that the internal revenue service had “learned” that caspersen “held an account at lgt” a private bank controlled by liechtenstein’s royal family she noted that liechtenstein had agreed in december  to disclose the names of wealthy americans with accounts at lgt “but it was unclear if mr caspersen’s name was among them”the financial pressure on caspersen had no doubt ratcheted up exponentially in february  when us federal prosecutors entered into a “deferred prosecution agreement” with ubs the giant swiss bank whereby ubs agreed to pay a  million fine from  to  the bank had “participated in a scheme to defraud the united states” and the irs by “actively assisting” american clients to create and then conceal offshore accounts after further negotiations ubs agreed to turn over to the irs the names of  wellheeled americans who were suspected of using the offshore bank accounts to avoid paying billions of dollars of taxes to the irs the us government had hoped to get information on more than  secret swiss bank accounts but agreed to the lower number as part of the settlement with ubsin march the irs offered amnesty from criminal prosecution to americans with offshore accounts who had not properly been paying taxes to take advantage of the amnesty program taxpayers had to come forward voluntarily tell all and agree to pay back taxes plus interest plus a penalty in an effort to encourage tax evaders to “get right” with the irs commissioner doug shulman said the irs coffers are expected to swell by billions of dollars in otherwise uncollected taxes as a result of the ubs dealthe ubs agreement “sent a shock wave around the world” shulman later observed “it has showed we are serious about piercing the veil of bank secrecy” the original irs deadline to obtain the amnesty was september    days after caspersen committed suicide that date was later extended to october the moneymanagement firm boxwood strategic advisors observed that since caspersen’s tax basis in beneficial stock was so low—his father had helped to nurture and grow the business  years before it was sold—any sale of the household stock or hsbc stock that caspersen received after the acquisition would have been subject to gargantuan capitalgains taxes it is possible that in order to minimize those he might have sought offshore tax advice and considered offshore tax havenswhittemore for one says caspersen was “very aware” of the september  amnesty deadline and he made numerous decisions based upon what could be looming problems for him with the government “some subtle and foolish some thoughtful” whittemore was not surprised that caspersen would have sought advice about minimizing the taxes that needed to be paid “i don’t know how he avoided the irs for so many years and then got in trouble” whittemore says caspersen’s tax problems “had been under discussion and brewing for some time i’m told” whittemore believes the dispute with the irs was about “the way he accounted for some of the profits from the sale of the company” and not “one of these tax residency things” the irs will not commentwhittemore who is now helping to plan morgan stanley’s thanniversary celebration which will take place this year recounted another apparent reversal of fortune caspersen had experienced in the years after he sold beneficial evidently he says caspersen took several hundred million dollars and gave it to goldman sachs’s privatewealthmanagement group to invest “he used to tell me goldman is wonderful for dinners and lunches but they lost  million for him” whittemore recalls adding that caspersen took the remaining money away from goldman and gave it to james allwin a former morgan stanley partner who had formed aetos capital an independent moneymanagement firm in  goldman sachs declined to comment on its relationship with caspersen after caspersen’s death whittemore who owns a little piece of aetos inquired whether caspersen’s family was still an aetos customer and he was told it was “so i just don’t know exactly how bad the situation is” whittemore saysothers are wondering as well but barbara caspersen and her four sons are not talking publicly records kept by martin county florida show that on september   the jupiter island house was “sold” to barbara for  former lehman brothers ceo richard fuld did a similar thing with his jupiter island house—transferring its title to his wife kathy for —in november  a number of her neighbors would not be surprised to see barbara move fulltime to jupiter island if for no other reason than that florida’s bankruptcy laws protect a residence from being part of a bankruptcy proceeding—meaning that she could keep the house and live in it and creditors could not get hold of it in  a new jersey newspaper noted that the caspersens had “taken up legal residence in taxfriendly florida”were the matter of caspersen’s alleged unpaid taxes stands with the irs or the justice department is unknown according to the new york times liens have been placed on the trusts of the four caspersen sons who together have hired attorney henry christensen iii—of astorfamily litigation fame—to represent them christensen did not respond to numerous requests to be interviewed the question has even been raised by the st petersburg times about whether the irs might seek to claw back caspersen’s  million gift to harvard law schoolthose who have depended on caspersen’s largesse in the past such as baird tipson the president of washington college in chestertown maryland—one of the four colleges that are annual beneficiaries of the hodson trust—feel distraught over his death tipson was moved to post a eulogy of sorts on washington college’s facebook page “everywhere i look i see buildings that could not have been built students who could not have studied here and programs that could not have flourished without finn caspersen’s help” tipson wrotehe too remains at a loss to explain the unexpected turn caspersen’s life took was it his health problems his financial problems or a combination of them both plus other things “anyone reading about the difficulties with the irs would have to assume that that had something to do with his decision” he says “but my guess is that most of us are more complicated than that you mentioned the cancer—there may be other things we don’t know about that kind of preyed on him and i think when people get into a state where they’re willing to do something like that it’s not necessarily rational he may have just felt like everything is piling up on me and there’s no way out but how can anyone know”shareemailfacebooktwitteryou might like“i want to fcking kill all the leakers” scaramucci explodes in unhinged latenight rantvanity fairwhy the scariest

foundation — founded by the billionaire louis m bacon to promote conservation — on losing options in a personal brokerage accountbut the authorities also said that in november mr caspersen used some of the money to cover his tracks after making separate unauthorized wire transfers of  million and mr caspersen worked as a partner at park hill group a division of pjt partners until he was fired last week it was there that he was said to be able to exploit a client billing system that allowed him to siphon money into his own personal accountthese transfers represent fees paid by two clients
