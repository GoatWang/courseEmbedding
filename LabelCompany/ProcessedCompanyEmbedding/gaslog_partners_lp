calculations we plan to make certain investments in the vessels with the aim of enhancing their operational performance at a total cost of approximately  million which is expected to be capitalized as part of the respective vessels cost lng market update and outlook during the quarter there has been continued momentum in the startup of new lng liquefaction capacity with the fourth train at sabine pass commencing commercial production later this year wheatstone in australia and cove point on the east coast of the us are expected to start production in total wood mackenzie estimates that there will be projects with approximately  million tonnes per annum mtpa of nameplate capacity coming online in  in addition shells  mtpa floating liquefaction facility prelude departed samsung heavy industries en route to the browse basin offshore australia sabine pass shipped  cargoes in the second quarter of  around four times as many as the same period in  demonstrating the significant rampup of the facility as new trains have come online since startup the facility has shipped lng to over  different countries which include most recently thailand pakistan taiwan poland and the uk the diversity in cargo destination has meant that the average distance travelled for us cargoes has been almost  nautical miles approximately double the global longterm average which is positive for shipping demand some offtakers from projects currently under development are yet to secure all of their shipping requirements leading to increased tender activity in the medium and longer term charter markets these tenders include requirements for both newbuild vessels and onthewater vessels with the latter being positive in terms of absorbing the current oversupply in the spot market growing lng supply has to date been met by increased demand in both new and existing markets for example japan and south korea the two largest lng importing nations have increased their lng imports in the first half of  by  and  respectively versus the same period in  the new south korean president moon jaein has committed to cease production of certain existing coalfired power plants to halt construction of new coal and nuclear power plants and not to extend the lifespan of ageing nuclear reactors all of which are expected to drive future lng demand in the country demand in the first half of  in emerging lng markets such as china  and pakistan  has risen sharply over the same period last year pakistans petroleum minister said in july that the country could import over  mtpa by  compared to  mtpa currently which would make pakistan the fifthlargest importer in the world based on current levels of consumption looking longer term while final investment decisions fids for new liquefaction projects in the current environment continue to be very limited there have been a number of encouraging recent developments for example eni took a fid on the  mtpa coral south lng project offshore mozambique in june  with bp having signed an agreement to purchase  of the lng produced in late  in addition at the end of this quarter the us department of energy authorized an additional  mtpa of exports from the lake charles project in louisiana bringing total authorized exports to  mtpa in the same month energy transfer korean gas corporation and shell signed a memorandum of understanding to study joint participation in this project post quarterend qatar petroleum announced its intention to increase lng production to  mtpa from  mtpa today by doubling the size of the new gas project in the southern sector of the north field a number of markets that do not currently import gas are exploring lng as an alternative to oil and coal or to replace declining domestic supply many countries with growing power demand such as ivory coast south africa bangladesh and myanmar are looking at floating storage and regasification units fsru as a quicktomarket costeffective solution to import lng other countries with fsrus already in place such as pakistan are looking at expanding their use of fsrus due to the successful commissioning and effective operations of the existing units fsrus continue to dominate new import markets as a quicker to build more flexible and lower cost alternative to an onshore facility many producers and marketers of lng appear to be focusing their attention on fsrus as a key enabler in creating new markets for their lng in the shorter term lng shipping market tfde headline rates have increased year on year but remain below midcycle rates at around  per day according to clarksons whilst a recovery in spot rates to midcycle levels is taking longer than anticipated we continue to see a greater number of fixtures in  compared to the same period in  and increasing signs of seasonality both of which point to a tightening market over time this market tightening should be helped by the low level of new vessel orders which stand at  for  year to date
