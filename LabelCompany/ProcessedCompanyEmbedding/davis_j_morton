 including the former head of dh blair  company j morton davis along with bondmarket bottomfisher wilbur ross classaction megalawyer melvyn weiss and the family of new york publisher jerry finkelstein  has come up with a scheme to help themselves to maybe as much as  million of money that the companys outside investors might assume belongs at least partly to them from the point of view of the insiders the terms are really quite brilliant unable it would appear to find any bond shop craven or shameless enough to underwrite a placement of notes to buy up the outsiders what assets could collateralize the dreck anyway the insiders simply formed themselves into a group dominated by the aforementioned mr davis  a group large enough to command  percent outright control of the voting rights in ncoms stock the insiders then announced that they intend to set up a separate shell company to be called newco headed by jerrys other son and andys brother jimmy finkelstein in short all thats really happening here is that the outsiders are being forced to sell to the insiders who are paying  million to buy them out where will the money come from why from news communications own balance sheet where else jimmy finkelstein will pony up  from his own pocket or that of a rich and aging relative  and we know who that will be as for the  million that remains to be covered well theres the aforementioned  of news communications remaining cash which brings us down to   all of which can be covered simply by selling the companys receivables to a factoring company

class action litigation website  leflaw lawrence e feldman  associates in september of  joann manson and her colleagues at the harvard medical school issued a press release regarding the results of a study of the health risks associated with being fat the press release claimed that the data the authors had collected from the nurses health study provided compelling evidence for the proposition that even mild to moderate overweight is associated with a substantial increase of premature death this claim drew an enormous amount of attention indeed over the next five years the nurses health study became the most commonly cited piece of evidence in the mass media for the claim that fat kills the most charitable way of characterizing this statement is that it was a gross distortion of the data the study had collected a more accurate characterization would be that it was a lie in fact mansons study had found no statistically significant increased risk of mortality associated with let alone caused by mild to moderate obesity as she herself later admitted when pressed on the point in one of those shocking coincidences that tend to pop up all the time in the world of obesity research joann manson turned out to be a paid consultant to interneuron pharmaceuticals the company that developed and patented dexfenfluramine the failure to note this little detail is par for the course when it comes to the american medias eagerness to reprint the propaganda of the diet industry at the time that dexfenfluramine and its cousin fenphen were being approved mit professor richard wurtman was
