“investment companies” under sections aa or ac of the act if the fund and its series are deemed to be investment companies however applicants request an exemption under section c and e of the act from all provisions of the act except sections  through  of the act and the rules and regulations under those sections  section aa of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities applicants believe that the fund will not be an investment company under section aa because the fund will be in the business of investing in and being beneficial owner of apartment complexes not securities  section ac of the act provides that an issuer is an “investment company” if it is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of such issuers total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items applicants state that although the local limited partnership interests may be deemed “investment securities” they are not readily marketable cannot be sold without severe adverse tax consequences and have no value apart from the value of the apartment complexes owned by the local limited partnerships  applicants believe that the twotier structure is consistent with the purposes and criteria set forth in the commissions release concerning twotier real estate partnerships the start printed page “release” the release states that investment companies that are twotier real estate partnerships that invest in limited partnerships engaged in the development and operation of housing for low and moderate income persons may qualify for an exemption from the act pursuant to section c section c provides that the commission may exempt any person from any provision of the act and any rule thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section e permits the commission to require companies exempted from the registration requirements of the act to comply with certain specified provisions of the act as though the company were a registered investment company  the release lists two conditions designed for the protection of investors which must be satisfied by twotier partnerships to qualify for the exemption under section c first interests in the issuer should be sold only to persons for whom investments in limited profit essentially taxshelter investments would not be unsuitable second requirements for fair dealing by the general partner of the issuer with the limited partners of the issuer should be included in the basic organizational documents of the company  applicants assert among other things that the suitability standards set forth in the application the requirements for fair dealing provided by the partnership agreement and pertinent governmental regulations imposed on each local limited partnership by various federal state and local agencies provide protection to investors in units in addition applicants assert that the requested exemption is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority jill m peterson assistant secretary end signature end
