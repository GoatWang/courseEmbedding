alternative beta subsidiary    under the expense limitation agreement salient advisors lp salient advisors or advisor has contractually agreed to waive all or a portion of its management fee and reimburse or pay operating expenses of the fund to the extent necessary to maintain the funds total operating expenses at  for class a  for class c and  for class i shares excluding certain expenses such as taxes brokerage and transactional expenses interest short dividend expense any acquired fund fees and expenses expenses associated with the funds investments in the alternative beta

limitation agreement expires on july   unless renewed by mutual agreement of the fund and the advisor based upon a determination doing so would be appropriate under the prevailing circumstances the advisor is permitted to recover expenses attributable to the fund or a class thereof that the advisor has borne whether through reduction of its management fee or otherwise in later periods to the

                     portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities and investments or turns over its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance the funds portfolio turnover for the fiscal year ended december   was  of the average value of its portfolio under applicable requirements derivative instruments and instruments with a maturity of one year or less at the time of acquisition are excluded from the calculation of the portfolio turnover rate which leads to the  portfolio turnover rate shown above if these instruments were included in the calculation the fund would have a high portfolio turnover rate principal investment strategies the fund invests both long and short primarily in futures and forward contracts but may also invest in other financial instruments which may include securities as well as derivatives in order to gain exposure to a variety of nontraditional risk premia identified by the advisor risk premia plural for a risk premium are the excess positive expected returns from exposures to or strategies in various asset classesmarkets and investment styles as discussed below above the riskfree rate represented by cash or government bonds the fund will also hold a large portion of its assets either directly or indirectly through the alternative beta subsidiary as discussed below in cash money market instruments or other cash equivalents some of which will serve as margin or collateral for the funds futures contracts or other derivatives positions investment process the advisors investment process begins with analysis and systematic identification of various factors which may include by way of example but not limitation market inefficiencies market participant behaviors supply and demand imbalances market expectations and cyclical trends that the advisor believes provide nontraditional risk premia once identified the advisor determines which global markets such as equity commodity currency interest rate and other markets are appropriate for each risk premium and whether to gain exposure to the risk premium by directly investing in financial instruments using its own systematic strategies or indirectly by entering into a derivatives transaction with a third party the advisor constructs a portfolio in which it attempts to balance the risk contribution of the risk premia or investment strategies and for which it targets a  annualized standard deviation of returns variance the risk calculation is derived from each strategys standard deviation of returns its correlation with each of the other strategies within the portfolio and the percentage weight of each strategy within the portfolio the portfolio is rebalanced dynamically according to this framework on at least a monthly basis although rebalancing may occur more frequently investment types the fund primarily gains exposure to asset classes such as equities commodities currencies and interest rates by investing in futures swaps and forward contracts cash money market instruments or other cash equivalents some of which will serve as margin or collateral for the funds futures contracts or other derivatives positions and by investing in the alternative beta subsidiary a whollyowned and controlled subsidiary of the fund organized under the laws of the cayman islands for purposes of certain of the funds derivatives trading geographic limitations the fund has no geographic limits on where its investments may be located or where its assets may be exposed this flexibility allows the fund to take advantage of investments or gain exposure to asset classes and markets around the world which include emerging markets principal investment risks an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or any other government agency the funds principal risk factors are listed below the funds shares will go up and down in price meaning that you could lose money by investing in the fund many factors influence a mutual funds performance an investment in the fund is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such before investing be sure to read the additional descriptions of these risks beginning on page  of the prospectus as an overall matter instability in the financial markets has led many governments including the united states government to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and in some cases a lack of liquidity federal state and other governments and their regulatory agencies or selfregulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the fund invests or the issuers of such instruments in ways that are unforeseeable legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the fund itself is regulated such legislation or regulation could limit or preclude the funds ability to achieve its investment objective risks of investment activities generally all securities investing and trading activities risk the loss of capital no assurance can be given that the funds investment activities will      be successful or that the funds shareholders will not suffer losses commodities risk exposure to the commodities markets may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities the value of commoditylinked derivative investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or sectors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments counterparty risk in general a derivative contract typically involves leverage ie   it provides exposure to potential gain or loss from a change in the level of the market price of a security currency or commodity or a basket or index in a notional amount that exceeds the amount of cash or assets required to establish or maintain the derivative contract many of these derivative contracts will be privately negotiated in the overthecounter market these contracts also involve exposure to credit risk since contract performance depends in part on the financial condition of the counterparty if a privately negotiated overthecounter contract calls for payments by the fund the fund must be prepared to make such payments when due in addition if a counterpartys creditworthiness declines the fund may not receive payments owed under the contract or such payments may be delayed under such circumstances and the value of agreements with such counterparty can be expected to decline potentially resulting in losses by the fund currency risk the risk that changes in currency exchange rates will negatively affect securities denominated in andor receiving revenues in foreign currencies the liquidity and trading value of foreign currencies could be affected by global economic factors such as inflation interest rate levels and trade balances among countries as well as the actions of sovereign governments adverse changes in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar may erode or reverse any potential gains from the funds investments in securities denominated in a foreign currency or may widen existing losses the funds net currency positions may expose it to risks independent of its securities positions debt securities risk fixedincome securities generally are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments andor repay the principal on its debt interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixedincome security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates when the general level of interest rates goes up the prices of most fixedincome securities go down when the general level of interest rates goes down the prices of most fixedincome securities go up        credit risk credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the security will not be able to make principal and interest payments when due changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the funds investment in that issuer the degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation securities rated by the rating agencies in   the four highest categories standard  poors sp aaa aa a and bbb fitch ratings fitch aaa aa a and bbb or moodys investors service inc moodys aaa aa a and baa are considered investment grade but they may also have some speculative characteristics meaning that they carry more risk than higher rated securities and may have problems making principal and interest payments in difficult economic climates investment grade ratings do not guarantee that bonds will not lose value        extension risk extension risk is the risk that when interest rates rise certain obligations will be paid off by the issuer or obligor more slowly than anticipated causing the value of these securities to fall rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates the value of longerterm securities generally changes more in response to changes in interest rates than shorterterm securities as a result in a period of rising interest rates securities may exhibit additional volatility and may lose value        interest rate risk the yields for certain securities are susceptible in the shortterm to fluctuations in interest rates and the prices of such securities may decline when interest rates rise interest rate risk in general is the risk that prices of fixed income securities generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates increase the fund may decline in value or suffer losses if short term or long term interest rates rise sharply or otherwise change in a manner not anticipated by the advisor        prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk that certain debt securities with high interest rates will be prepaid by the issuer before they mature when interest rates fall certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated and an investor may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments tends to increase as does price fluctuation as borrowers are motivated to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates during such periods reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds by the management team will generally be at lower rates of return than the return on the assets that were prepaid prepayment reduces the yield to maturity and the average life of the security derivatives risk the use of derivative instruments exposes the fund to additional risks and transaction costs these instruments come in many varieties and have a wide range of potential risks and rewards and may include futures contracts options on futures contracts options both written and purchased swaps swaptions and forward currency exchange contracts a risk of the funds use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets emerging market risk the fund intends to have exposure to emerging markets emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative emerging markets are more likely to      experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns to us investors in addition many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets equity securities risk equity securities may be subject to general movements in the stock market and a significant drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the fund has exposure the fund may have exposure to or invest in equity securities of companies with small or medium capitalization investments in securities of companies with small or medium capitalization involve certain risks that may differ from or be greater than those for larger companies such as higher volatility lower trading volume lack of liquidity fewer business lines and lack of public information see small and midcapitalization securities risk foreign securities risk foreign investments often involve special risks not present in us investments that can increase the chances that the fund will lose money these risks include      the fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight      changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the funds portfolio      the economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the united states with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product reinvestment of capital resources and balance of payments position      the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries      many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the united states and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to us securities laws      settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of us investments forward and futures contract risk the successful use of forward and futures contracts draws upon the advisors skill and experience with respect to such instruments and is subject to special risk considerations the primary risks associated with the use of futures contracts are a the imperfect correlation between the change in market value of the instruments held by the fund and the price of the forward or futures contract b possible lack of a liquid secondary market for a forward or futures contract and the resulting inability to close a forward or futures contract when desired c losses caused by unanticipated market movements which are potentially unlimited d the advisors inability to predict correctly the direction of securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors e the possibility that the counterparty will default in the performance of its obligations and f if the fund has insufficient cash it may have to sell securities from its portfolio to meet daily variation margin requirements and the fund may have to sell securities at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so high portfolio turnover risk the risk that when investing on a shorterterm basis the fund may as a result trade more frequently and incur higher levels of brokerage fees and commissions investment in money market mutual funds risk the fund invests in money market mutual funds an investment in a money market mutual fund is not insured or guaranteed by the fdic or any other government agency although such funds seek to preserve the value of the funds investment at  per share it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund leverage risk as part of the funds principal investment strategy the fund makes investments in futures contracts forward currency contracts and other derivative instruments the futures contracts and certain other derivatives provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure as well as the potential for greater loss if the fund uses leverage through activities such as borrowing entering into short sales purchasing securities on margin or on a whenissued basis or purchasing derivative instruments in an effort to increase its returns the fund has the risk of magnified losses that occur when losses affect an asset base enlarged by borrowings or the creation of liabilities that exceeds the net assets of the fund the net asset value of the fund employing leverage will be more volatile and sensitive to market movements leverage may involve the creation of a liability that requires the fund to pay interest liquidity risk certain securities may trade less frequently than those of larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations in the event certain securities experience limited trading volumes the prices may display abrupt or erratic movements at times additionally it may be more difficult for the fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices as a result these securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the advisor believes it is desirable to do so the funds investment in securities that are less actively traded or over time experience decreased trading volume may restrict its ability to take advantage of other market opportunities or to dispose of securities this also may affect adversely the funds ability to make dividend distributions the fund will not purchase or otherwise acquire any security if as a result more than  of its net assets would be invested in illiquid investments manager risk if the funds portfolio managers make poor investment decisions it will negatively affect the funds investment performance market events risk the us government and the federal reserve as well as certain foreign governments and their central banks have taken various steps designed to support and stabilize credit and financial markets since  reduction or withdrawal      of this support failure of efforts to stabilize the markets or investor perception that such efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally as well as have an adverse impact on the liquidity and value of certain securities in addition policy and legislative changes in the united states and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act was enacted in the us reflecting a significant revision of the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act addresses a variety of topics including among others new rules for trading in derivatives restrictions on banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading of certain instruments the registration and additional regulation of private fund managers and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans fund investments may be impacted by the doddfrank act and any related or additional legislation or regulation in unforeseeable ways the ultimate effect of the doddfrank act and any related or additional regulation is not yet known the impact of these changes on the markets and the practical implications for market participants may not be fully known for some time market risk market risk is the risk that the markets on which the funds investments trade will increase or decrease in value prices may fluctuate widely over short or extended periods in response to company market or economic news markets also tend to move in cycles with periods of rising and falling prices if there is a general decline in the securities and other markets your investment in the fund may lose value regardless of the individual results of the securities and other instruments in which the fund invests model and data risk given the complexity of the investments and strategies of the fund the advisor relies heavily on quantitative models both proprietary models developed by the advisor and those supplied by third party vendors and information and data supplied by third party vendors models and data models and data are used to construct sets of transactions and investments and to provide risk management insights when models and data prove to be incorrect or incomplete any decisions made in reliance thereon expose the fund to potential risks the success of relying on such models may depend on the accuracy and reliability of historical data supplied by third party vendors all models rely on correct market data inputs if incorrect market data is entered into even a wellfounded model the resulting information will be incorrect however even if market data is input correctly model prices will often differ substantially from market prices especially for securities with complex characteristics such as derivative securities momentum style risk investing in momentum entails establishing long positions in securities that have had positive recent returns and short positions in securities that have had negative recent returns these securities may be more volatile than a broad crosssection of securities in addition there may be periods when the momentum style is out of favor and during which the investment performance of a fund using a momentum strategy may suffer nondiversified status risk the fund is a nondiversified fund because the fund may invest in securities of a smaller number of issuers the fund may be more exposed to the risks associated with and developments affecting an individual issuer than a fund that invests more widely which may therefore have a greater impact on the funds performance short sale risk the fund may take a short position in a derivative instrument such as a future forward or swap a short position on a derivative instrument involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the value of the underlying instrument the fund may also from time to time sell securities short which involves borrowing and selling a security and covering such borrowed security through a later purchase a short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the short position there can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase the fund must set aside cover for short sales to comply with applicable sec provisions under the investment company act of  as amended  act small and midcapitalization securities risk the fund may invest its assets in the common stocks and other equity securities of small and midcapitalization companies with smaller market capitalizations while the advisor believes these investments may provide significant potential for appreciation they involve higher risks in some respects than do investments in common stocks and other equity securities of larger companies for example prices of such investments are often more volatile than prices of largecapitalization stocks and other equity securities in addition due to thin trading in some such investments an investment in these common stocks and other equity securities may be more illiquid than that of common stocks or other equity securities of larger market capitalization issuers see liquidity risk smaller capitalization companies also fail more often than larger companies and may have more limited management and financial resources than larger companies sovereign debt risk these investments are subject to the risk that a governmental entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on its sovereign debt due for example to cash flow problems insufficient foreign currency reserves political considerations the relative size of the governmental entitys debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place economic reforms required by the international monetary fund or other multilateral agencies if a governmental entity defaults it may ask for more time in which to pay or for further loans there is no legal process for collecting sovereign debt that a government does not pay nor are there bankruptcy proceedings through which all or part of the sovereign debt that a governmental entity has not repaid may be collected subsidiary risk by investing in the alternative beta subsidiary the fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with the alternative beta subsidiarys investments the commodityrelated instruments held by the alternative beta subsidiary are generally similar to those that are permitted to be held by the fund and are subject to the same risks that apply to similar investments if held directly by the fund see commodities risk      above there can be no assurance that the investment objective of the alternative beta subsidiary will be achieved the alternative beta subsidiary is not registered under the  act and unless otherwise noted in this prospectus is not subject to all the investor protections of the  act however the fund wholly owns and controls the alternative beta subsidiary and the fund and the alternative beta subsidiary are both managed by the advisor making it unlikely that the alternative beta subsidiary will take action contrary to the interests of the fund and its shareholders the board has oversight responsibility for the investment activities of the fund including its investment in the alternative beta subsidiary and the funds role as sole shareholder of the alternative beta subsidiary to the extent applicable to the investment activities of the alternative beta subsidiary the alternative beta subsidiary will be subject to the same investment restrictions and limitations and follow the same compliance policies and procedures as the fund changes in the laws of the united states andor the cayman islands could result in the inability of the fund andor the alternative beta subsidiary to operate as described in this prospectus and the sai and could adversely affect the fund including resulting in its orderly windingup swap agreements risk swap agreements involve the risk that the party with whom a fund has entered into the swap will default on its obligation to pay the fund and the risk that the fund will not be able to meet its obligations to pay the other party to the agreement tax risk in order for the fund to qualify as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code the fund must derive at least  percent of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income which is described in more detail in the sai income from certain commoditylinked derivative instruments in which the fund invests is not considered qualifying income the fund will therefore attempt to restrict its income from commoditylinked derivative instruments that do not generate qualifying income to a maximum of  percent of its gross income the funds investment in the alternative beta subsidiary is expected to provide the fund with exposure to the commodities markets within the limitations of the federal tax requirements of subchapter m the annual net profit if any realized by the alternative beta subsidiary and imputed for income tax purposes to the fund should constitute qualifying income for purposes of the fund remaining qualified as a regulated investment company for us federal income tax purposes tax law change risk although the internal revenue service irs has issued published guidance that qualifying income for a regulated investment company does not include income derived directly from certain commoditylinked derivative instruments the irs has indicated in a series of private letter rulings that income derived from a whollyowned offshore subsidiary such as the alternative beta subsidiary that invests in such commoditylinked derivative instruments does constitute qualifying income the fund has not applied for such a private letter ruling but relies upon an opinion of counsel based on customary representations that income derived from the alternative beta subsidiary should be treated as qualifying income in july  the irs suspended further issuance of these private letter rulings indicating that it was reconsidering the underlying policies the irs subsequently indicated informally that it intends to issue public guidance regarding the use of offshore subsidiaries by regulated investment companies to invest indirectly in commodities and that such guidance will be prospective in application and provide for transition periods for affected funds it is also possible that legislation on this issue could be introduced if the irs does issue public guidance or if legislation is enacted that results in an adverse determination relating to the treatment of income derived by the fund from the alternative beta subsidiary the fund would likely need to significantly change its investment strategy which could adversely affect the fund it is possible that the fund may be unable to qualify as a regulated investment company for one or more years meaning that all of its income and gains could be taxed first at the fund level and again when paid out to shareholders underlying funds risk because the fund may be an underlying fund for one or more related fund of funds and therefore a significant percentage of the funds outstanding shares may be held by a fund of funds a change in asset allocation by the fund of funds could result in purchases and redemptions of a large number of shares of the fund causing significant changes to the funds portfolio composition potential increases in expenses to the fund and purchases and sales of securities in a short timeframe each of which could negatively impact fund performance volatility risk the fund may have investments that appreciate or decrease significantly in value over short periods of time this may cause the funds net asset value per share to experience significant appreciations or decreases in value over short periods of time us government securities risk treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates maturities times of issuance and other characteristics obligations of us government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so certain of the government agency securities the fund may purchase are backed only by the credit of the government agency and not by full faith and credit of the united states performance information the bar chart and table below provide an indication of the risks of an investment in the fund the bar chart shows how the funds performance has varied from year to year the table shows how the funds average annual returns before
