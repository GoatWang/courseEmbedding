write a review events talk log in     custom house stboston ma    the negative reviews here are puzzling safety vip centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers although safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims i was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondrivers i specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rental upon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypoint the claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they can not to pay you if i could give  stars i would thankfully i dont have safety insurance however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family my experience with safety has been frustrating my claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails what kind of adjuster doesnt respond to clients i had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of i was a long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe safety insurance claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn

puzzling  safety vip centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience  and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived  i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything  my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new  the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  was this review … useful funny cool jeff k cambridge ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow jeff k stop following jeff k  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that was this review … useful  funny cool matthew k framingham ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow matthew k stop following matthew k  had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccupsthey even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsitei really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance was this review … useful  funny  cool  april p boston ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow april p stop following april p  what a joke  filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates  the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation  then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages  what a waste of time was this review … useful  funny cool michelle n north reading ma  friends  review share review embed review compliment send message follow michelle n stop following michelle n  one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again was this review … useful  funny cool andy s salisbury ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review

cool jackie m franklin ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow jackie m stop following jackie m  worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars was this review … useful  funny cool

unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice was this review … useful  funny

have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days

too many claims  whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company   scam was this review … useful  funny cool m y fitchburg ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow m y stop following m y  who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurancegoing with safety is a gamble the house always wins was this review … useful  funny  cool katie c boston ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow katie c stop following katie c  updated review listed in adventures in my car just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do  if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight  we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf  you think im kidding but im notonce again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hellofor an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of agewere sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday  funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that daybut then it gets better i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday  and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car  they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior  safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time  for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it  had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed  their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent  my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurancethe glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts  they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook  its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forumtheir business policies are questionable at best was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again… oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again unfortunately as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with via a textmessage than the help i got from safety read more was this review … useful  funny  cool julie t tacoma wa  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow julie t stop following julie t  i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event was this review … useful  funny cool steven w hudson ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow steven w stop following steven w  reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest  yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic eventwell done safety and thanks was this review … useful  funny  cool  matthew l south easton ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow matthew l stop following matthew l  ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach  but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to saythankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems was this review … useful funny  cool  blessed o brockton ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow blessed o stop following blessed o  stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to was this review … useful  funny cool michael m burlington ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow michael m stop following michael m  never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their driversalthough safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claimsi was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondriversi specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rentalupon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypointthe claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they can not to pay you was this review … useful  funny  cool adriana b wilmington

a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family was this review … useful  funny cool kswagg x campos portugal  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow kswagg x stop following kswagg x

long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you

expenses associated with communicating the recall to the public  manufacturers’ errors  omissions eo — medmarc offers recall coverage for thirdparty financial loss that results from the insured’s error or omission such as when the insured’s customer incurs expenses for undertaking a recall that arises as a result of the insured’s negligence in manufacturing or servicing of a product please

from medmarc our risk management services are intended for use by our insureds  on a limited basis however we will provide products liability risk management services on a feeforservice basis  for more information please contact our risk management department at riskmanagementmedmarccom or at  is the fact that a product is approved by the fda sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from medmarc fda approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis as is the regulatory history of the company but it is not sufficient information for medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote in order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs underwriters also will require information about the company’s size financial condition management team operations loss history and other information related to the company’s history and product lines what is medmarc’s capacity for medmarc’s products liability policy our capacity is  million per policy  for our manufacturers’ errors and omissions eo policy our capacity is  million   capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants  what is medmarcs target risk medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices pharmaceuticals biotechnology in vitro diagnostics personal hygiene products and animal care products  we cover both original equipment manufacturers oems and contract manufacturers  we cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trialstage startups to multinational companies with

liability risks  we can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk   we provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability such as supply chains product warnings and instructions for use and manufacturing procedures  there is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability  for this reason we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with fda requirements  we also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line will medmarc accept other carriers’ applications yes  medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers but please be aware that we may require additional information as a distributor do i need products liability coverage we recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies  if a distributor is required to repackage or install a product or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy  furthermore independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements a us distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the united states should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the us or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the us which could become very costly  medmarc’s risk management department has published an article that explains distributor risks the article is titled “why distributors may be more  vulnerable to products liability than they realize” and it is available on medmarc’s website in our resource library does your policy cover sales representatives “sales reps” the actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage such circumstances include when sales reps  provide product consultations  make device technical adjustments  are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care or  are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses for more information see the ask an expert by fran stockwell “do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage”   does your policy cover explants of implantable devices our products liability policy covers explantations ie the surgical removal of implantable devices only when the product causes the patient harm what is the difference between a claimsmade policy and an occurrence policy insurance coverage can either be on a claims made or occurrence basis these terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period a claimsmade policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year or tail period regardless of when the loss occurred and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year as specified on the declarations form a claims made policy provides coverage for claims made and reported during the policy term as long as they were made after the retroactive date the retroactive date is the start date of the first claimsmade policy obtained so long as it has been kept active via renewal that date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed for example if a client first obtains claimsmade coverage on october   and it is now  and theyve maintained the same coverage their claimsmade policy covers all incidents since october   if the client no longer has coverage in  and a patient sues in  for an incident that occurred in  the client does not have coverage for that incident unless they purchased tail coverage  an occurrence policy in contrast covers incidents that occur but are not necessarily reported during the term the policy is in force for example if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering  and a patient is injured by the clients product in  but does not sue for their injuries until  the client has coverage from their  policy even if they are no longer insured will medmarc provide coverage for nonmedical products because of our familiarity and longstanding connection with this industry we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include nonmedical products often we can accommodate this coverage need  your medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering nonmedical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds what information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk for clinical trial submissions include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review how do i obtain a quote for manufacturers errors and omissions eo coverage from medmarc the eo application can be found here along with a completed application your medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers how does medmarc calculate minimum premiums minimum premiums

log in     custom house stboston ma    the negative reviews here are puzzling safety vip centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers although safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims i was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondrivers i specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rental upon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypoint the claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they can not to pay you if i could give  stars i would thankfully i dont have safety insurance however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family my experience with safety has been frustrating my claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails what kind of adjuster doesnt respond to clients i had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of i was a long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe safety insurance claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn

katie c stop following katie c  updated review listed in adventures in my car just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do  if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight  we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf  you think im kidding but im notonce again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hellofor an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of agewere sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday  funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that daybut then it gets better i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday  and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car  they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior  safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time  for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it  had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed  their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent  my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurancethe glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts  they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook  its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forumtheir business policies are questionable at best was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again… oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again unfortunately as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with

called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers although safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims i was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondrivers i specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rental upon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypoint the claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they can not to pay you if i could give  stars i would thankfully i dont have safety insurance however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family my experience with safety has been frustrating my claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails what kind of adjuster doesnt respond to clients i had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of i was a long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe safety

as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an

ma    the negative reviews here are puzzling safety vip centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive been with safety for my auto insurance since  and have two homeowner policies with them one since  and one since october of this year ive been involved in  car accidents none of which were my fault and the auto claims were all handled to my satisfaction perhaps it helps that i have an insurance agent i shop around for quotes each year and have not had another insurance company beat safetys quotes as for my homeowners insurance ive never needed to file a claim when i was shopping around for a policy for my new house in october i received  quotes for the same coverage amount and safety was the lowest ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time if i could give  stars i would thankfully i dont have safety insurance however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam i was a long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe safety insurance cancelled my policy with no notice and did not inform me of a lapse in insurance coverage they are utterly incompetent and steer clear of this agency my experience with safety has been frustrating my claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails what kind of adjuster doesnt respond to clients i had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of i had an auto policy with safety i was a member for over two years and always paid on time i made one late payment and they canceled my insurance and then refused to reinstate me on their policy even after reviewing my payment history it was bizarre safety insurance claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup

predjudice stereotypical insurance they are not supportive dont be in my shoes stay far away  just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am currently waiting in the claims services office in newton ma ive been waiting for over an hour now to receive my total loss settlement check one of their clients hit me however thanks to the incompetence of heather the agent in charge of my file what should have been a quick pick up has become a long waiting game for everyone at this office even before this it would take at least i kid you not ten phone calls to get one back from her and apparently she did not contact this claims office about my settlement so we are now going on a  hour wait until she comes back from her lunch break thanks to her i will never consider safety insurance for myself and will make sure to warn others from this company stay away safety insurance is the worst company i have dealt with ever i am going to switch my policy and never do business with them again i filed a claim for my home and it went from crazy to crazierit took them  days to follow up with me safety insurance claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup

customer service and absurd hours we meet again unfortunately as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with via a textmessage than the help i got from safety read more was this

puzzling safety vip centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i

reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers although safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims i was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondrivers i specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rental upon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypoint the claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they can not to pay you if i could give  stars i would thankfully i dont have safety insurance however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family my experience with safety has been frustrating my claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails what kind of adjuster doesnt respond to clients i had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of i was a long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe safety

hours we meet again unfortunately as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with via a textmessage than the help i got from safety read more was this review … useful  funny  cool julie t tacoma

potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers although safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims i was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondrivers i specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rental upon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypoint the claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they can not to pay you if i could give  stars i would thankfully i dont have safety insurance however a client of theirs caused a car accident with me  months ago and after the audacity of claiming it wasnt the drivers fault and sending the case to arbitration and ultimately losing im still waiting to get reimbursed for my outofpocket expenses the the person on my case at safety was matt kelly and he has ignored my emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to emails so safe to say that safety insurance has terrible customer service heads up  even if im not a current customer of yours you should still provide a high level of service because i could one day decide to switch providers not now of course but im also not recommending you to any friends or family my experience with safety has been frustrating my claim adjuster never answers his phone or replies to my emails what kind of adjuster doesnt respond to clients i had to speak to other adjusters to get my problem taken care of i was a long time safety ins customer but because their homeowners ins rates were climbing i decided to switch insurers i found a new agency and safety was notified of the swtch and so was my bank everything was done properly a full month before my policy with safety expired it has been a year since the switch and safety will not let me go they have continued to bill me for the first potion of that year despite the fact that noone authorized it i have called written and checked to be sure that the bank didnt somehow authorize a continued policy through safety noone at all authorized the continuation of a duly cancelled policy yet safety refuses to stop billing me everyone else got the notification in a timely manner of the new insurer and safety did too do not ever contract with safety unless you want a lifetime of harrassment for a bill you never made and do not owe safety insurance claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup rating details

again… oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again unfortunately as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with via a textmessage than the help i got from safety read more was this

completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic event well done safety and thanks ive used safety since  or so my girlfriend and i both have auto policies with them and a home owners policy ive had to use the auto policy two times and the claims were processed without issue i will say the adjuster was difficult to reach but the body shop got paid my vehicle was fully repaired in a timely manner so i have nothing really bad to say thankfully i havent had to use the homeowners policy my brother has used them for a homeowners claim and there were no problems stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their drivers although safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claims i was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondrivers i specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rental upon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypoint the claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they

breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with

system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i

after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with via a textmessage than the help i got from safety read more was this review … useful  funny  cool julie t tacoma wa  friends  reviews  photo share review embed review compliment send message follow

safety vip centers if you have a fender bender are a completely stress free system of getting through this potentially time sucking experience and because i have the safety shield plus coverage on my policy the  deductible was waived i went to the newton vip and was helped by maryellen who was so friendly and professional she took care of everything my totally covered rental car was waiting for me and in a few days i will get my runner back good as new the body shops vip use oem parts and guarantee their work  this company is the worst of the worst claims adjusters regularly dont return calls and i have to call them twice a day and leave messages for both the claims adjuster and supervisor to maybe get a call back  days later company refuses to acknowledge a diminished value claim after one of their policyholders rear ended me and the safety claims adjuster employee suggests i take safety to small claims court i very well may do that had i read all these negative reviews prior to signing up for safety i would have been scared away however i can say as a customer for years theyve been great last year a week before christmas my family was involved in a car accident i called and was quickly explained the process which included an adjuster coming to my house on dec rd the claim being processed in about  weeks including holiday time and getting us whole once again without any hiccups they even went the extra mile by getting us the claim check earlier than expected and allowing me to pick it up at opening of business onsite i really have nothing bad to say we have our house multiple cars and toys insured with safety insurance what a joke filed a claim over  months ago and its like pulling teeth to get any updates the only time i hear from them is if i reach out  and its constantly  we are reviewing i havent received all the info pending further investigation then she gives me an estimate of what i would potentially receive from this home claim due to a leak and it wouldnt even cover a dinner for   let alone any of the damages what a waste of time one star is too much the absolute worst customer service i have ever experienced someone falsely opened a claim against me last february i did not get notified by safety until august i have proof i was at least  miles away from the accident with my vehicle and i still have yet to hear anything all ive received is rude emails in response to my questions and concerns and i never receive a call back from a person i will never do business with this company again miserable experience short of a miracle there is no way you can get in touch with someone on the phone worst experience ever i was a customer for over  years and just changed companies my car was at the body shop over a month than it needed to be due to their substandard service causing delays they made me negotiate the price of the rental car overage rather than just admit their error and pay it in good faith never answer phone calls days to return a phone call just an awful experience altogether is there less than  stars had a glass claim gave me the runaround i pay close to k per year on a vehicle and your giving me a runaround on a claim that cost under k what a joke and laurie in glass claims is unprofessional when i told her im leaving the company she stated she didnt care and was unprofessional hands down the worst insurance company i have had im out after this year this company will definitely get bankrupt soon due to their business practice i have had safety for  years and my parents for almost  and thy have always been great i got into my first bad accident where a driver hit my drivers side door my car was a total loss and safety wont insure my rental while i wait for my total loss check past  days i spoke to  people who would not help appeal this matter truly disappointing service buyer beware my husband and i have been with them for decades after  claims in  years none before we were told they would not renew us due to too many claims whoa i thought i purchased insurance in case i got in an accident never ever ever do business with this company  scam who woulda thunk it hmmmlet me check the reviews on this insurance place because i have to have insurance going with safety is a gamble the house always wins just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with  on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf you think im kidding but im not once again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hello for an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of age were sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that day but then it gets better  i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurance the glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forum their business policies are questionable at best i am really surprised by the poor reviews here as i had a fantastic experience with safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did

boston ma  friends  reviews  photos share review embed review compliment send message follow katie c stop following katie c  updated review listed in adventures in my car just when we thought safety insurance couldnt get any worse they do  if youre reading yelp reviews to determine whether or not youd want to use safety insurance please let my experiences really give you a glimpse of what youll have to deal with on the night before thanksgiving hubs received a pretty serious crack in his windshield that spiderwebbed across his line of sight  we called safety insurance only to realize that the office was closed for the thanksgiving holiday which included thursday the actual holiday friday fyi  its not an official holiday saturday and sunday because safety insurances business hours are only between  mf  you think im kidding but im notonce again we call safety insurance when there is a problem and not because we want to say hellofor an insurance company to be closed over the busiest travel weekend of the year is absolutely unacceptable in this day of agewere sorry but the office is closed on friday as part of the thanksgiving holiday  funny because they had no problem processing my payment due that daybut then it gets better i continued to send scathing tweets and facebook posts to safety insurance and we finally received a phone call on friday  and as it turned out safety had no record of coverage on my husbands car  they only had coverage on his prior vehicle not his current vehicle which was purchased  months prior  safety insurance you fucked up and you fucked up big time  for  months we were riding around with no coverage according to them while paying for it  had we been in an accident regardless of fault we would have been royally screwed  their hours are terrible and their agents are completely incompetent  my puppy school dropout dog would be the employee of the month at safety insurancethe glass was fixed but i would have rather had to run through a wood chipper than to deal with safety again so to sum up heres how it goes  they are closed over the busiest travel weekends of the year  there were no checks and balances to realize that a car that had coverage was no longer registered in massachusetts  they also did not realize my name or my husbands name was associated with this mystery vehicle  since your insurance is your proof of registration in ma there was a total lapse in communication when a new vehicle was purchased  the only way youre going to immediate service is if you pull a move out of alec baldwins playbook and go berserk on twitter and facebook  its funny how quickly they can magically locate your account and address your problems when in a public forumtheir business policies are questionable at best was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again… oh safety insurance with your crappy customer service and absurd hours we meet again unfortunately as an insurance company i dont call you just to shoot the breeze and see how things are i call you when theres a problem  and just as i expected and as history repeats itself you werent there  its not me  its definitely youon a sunny saturday afternoon cruising down  with my dog buckled in the backseat we were behind a truck and like a slowmotion movie the gravel in the bed of the truck started to come out  there were three nowin options  swerve and cause an accident slam on the brakes and cause an accident or drive through the barrage of gravel and hope for the best  with a dog in the backseat and after having to deal with safety after being the one being rearended i plowed through the gravel and came out with a decent sized crack in the windshield  not sure what to do i got off at the next exit and called safety to get an auto glass repair claim in as soon as possible  since it was a glassonly claim this is what i receivedoh were sorry you will have to call back during normal business hours  normal business hours are monday through friday from am to pmsay what  so bottom line is this  there is no  service with safety  yes it is an auto insurance company but if you are in an accident or if you need help they are only available during normal business hours which statistically speaking is when you are least likely to be in an accident and need help  like i said you dont call an auto insurance company just to say hi see how things are going and to shoot the breeze  no you call them when there is an emergency and you need helpphone calls went unreturnedemails went unansweredanother scathing facebook post and tweetto sum it up i took care of the insurance process with getting the windshield repaired  with a snowstorm looming in the forecast it had to be taken care of sooner rather than later and thats just what i did  for the longest time i told my husband i was done with safety insurance and now i mean itsafety insurance we are breaking up  your crappy customer service your shitty hours and your incompetent agents just arent cutting it anymore  its not me  its definitely you read more was this review … useful  funny  cool   previous review we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file… we have safety insurance for both homeowners and auto insurance  unfortunately we have had to file claims under both policies  in  our homeowners claim was to cover damage from a storm  the claim representative was very polite compassionate and she was able to cut us a check to cover the damage in less than a week  the house was fixed we were happy and life went on  that experience is the only reason why this is a star reviewsafety insurance offered me a rather competitive rate for auto insurance  with a great credit score a perfect driving record and a newer vehicle they offered me a great deal and i signed on  all was good until i was rearended on my way to work one morning  my phone call to safety insurance agency from the side of the road in tears was received with sorry we dont have any claims representatives right now  but you can leave a message  at that point i should have asked the woman who hit me to get back in her car back up and plow right through me  because had i known what i know now getting hit again by a  chevy astro van plowing through an intersection would have not nearly as painful as having to deal with safety  when the butterball turkey hotline has better service and phone coverage than an insurance company you know youre in troubleas an educated individual i know that insurance companies really dont care if you are okay in the event of an auto accident  they want to settle your claim for as little money as possible and keep their fingers crossed you dont lawyerup  insurance companies make money  that is their businessas a customer that pays all the bills on time and is not out to defraud the company i was treated as if i was a felon  phone calls went unanswered  emails were transferred to clueless representatives  well get back to you  yeah right and the checks are in the mail  the accident was in september  and it wasnt resolved until may   thats  months  it wasnt until i left a scathing facebook wall post on their wall that they contacted me  in conclusion  yes their rates as a good driver are very competitive  however safety insurance is only good until you need them  claims representatives are incompetent and downright rude  even as the victim your only effective way of getting compensated for your outofpocket costs from an accident are to lawyerupi can think of a million other things id rather do than have to call safety insurance when there is an emergency and i need help  in fact im fairly positive id get more help from an exboyfriend that i broke up with via a textmessage than the help i got from safety read more was this review … useful  funny  cool julie t tacoma

safety insurance and lets be honest to be thrilled with how everything worked out after youve rearended someone and crumpled the front end of your car must mean someone else did something right i went directly to the vip claims center in newton  which was still open after pm everyone there was super helpful and friendly thanks don i was able to get a rental car close to my home the very next day although i was given an estimate of two weeks for repairs including a holiday i got daily updates and the car ended up being ready two days early and looked amazing the garage that safety used in needham did a great job i will say that the cost of repairs seemed a bit high and i suspect they may have done more than was absolutely necessary  but  it didnt come out of my pocket and that is the point of insurance overall a really great experience and im sad that i will no longer have them as a provider due to relocation they really came through for me during a stressful event was this review … useful  funny cool steven w hudson ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow steven w stop following steven w  reading some of the other negative reviews gave me pause but i must say i had a positive experience with safety insurance i have a homeowners policy with safety and this past winter the water pipes in my home froze while i was away when i returned home i discovered a water fall rushing from my upstairs bathroom flowing through the upstairs floor cascading into my downstairs kitchen a water supply pipe to my upstairs bath had burst and flooded the house the water may well have been running for days a large portion of my small house was essentially wrecked there wasnt a room that was untouched it was truly a disaster reconstruction took nearly  months however safety was there for me they investigated the claim and the underlying cause  which was traced to a faulty switch in my furnace they appraised the damage and paid the full cost of replacement  which was substantial at the end of the day reconstruction and temporary living costs approached six figures throughout the ordeal my claims representative was patient professional and responsive i admit there were some nervous moments early on while i awaited the results of the claim investigation but in the end safety came through and fullfilled their commitment moreover i believe their reconstruction estimateappraisal was fair even generous my house had antique quartersawn pine floors they were very expensive to replace and yet safety stepped up and paid the full cost they also paid the full replacement cost for my custom kitchen cabinets and appliancesand all the rest  yeah it was a huge ordeal something i never ever want to go through again but for me safety insurance saved the day they did in a professional and timely manner what an insurance company is designed to do protect me from a huge financial loss as the result of a catastrophic eventwell done safety and

blessed o stop following blessed o  stay far far away from this company they are only kind to customers when there is another insurance company involved where they could get a reimbursement if your car is involved in a hit and run forget it  dont even bother reporting it to them my vehicle was hit while parked and my claim was denied because there was paint underneath the headlight where i was hit and they think it is latex paint from a fixed object and the appraiser they hired stated that the light broke in a different why so that means it was on when the car was damaged that is completely impossible when i was at work all day they do not want to pay because they cant get reimbursement from another insurance as they would in a regular accident i have been a customer for years paid on time and only filed one claim  and i wasnt even driving the car in that previous accident i will fight this till the end because i know that they want to avoid paying out and i will bring this to court if i have to was this review … useful  funny cool michael m burlington ma  friends  reviews share review embed review compliment send message follow michael m stop following michael m  never do business with safety insurance if you are on the road pray that you are not hit by one of their driversalthough safety insurance will move your claim along quickly they will fail to keep you up to date on their personal action to one of your claimsi was actually hit by one of their drivers the man swore he was an honest person and told me that i was in his blind spot however he was a liar and told the estimator false information although i cannot blame the clientele that safety insurers entirely upon them i can blame them for how they handle a claim from one of their nondriversi specifically asked the claims adjuster if he needed pictures from the accident to expedite the claim on his side in case there was a dispute he told me we outsource that to an estimator and it is their drivers word against mine on damages so he would not need pictures when i got an estimate i asked the claims adjuster for next steps he told me to take it to an auto body shop to get fix and we will repair the damages i went to the auto body shop they agreed with the estimate from the assessors and that i would need to go through the insurance company for the rentalupon doublechecking the rental policy with safety i found that they said they where  liable complete nonsense i then had to send them pictures of the skid marks pictures of the sites and pictures of the damages with my story pointbypointthe claims adjuster could have saved me a lot of time by just telling me that they found me  liable when i asked him about next steps they are an insurance company who practices are dubious to say the least if you get hit by one of their drivers make sure you call the police if the police will not showup take detailed pictures of the accident and car safety will do what ever they

emails and calls until  weeks ago when he asked his colleague maureen miller to follow up with me now im being ignored by her too when i call either one of them they dont answer nor do they respond to
