attracted him  a veteran with almost  years in the industry having managed billions in credit funds  to take over the general partnership of third fridayby selling at the money straddles of sp index and hedging them by buying out of the money puts and calls the fund is truly marketneutral and protects capital with several “rings of defence” against normal and outsized market moveswhat’s interesting about the strategy is that it extracts returns from volatility and time value in options  characteristics that are always present in markets the fund also benefits from a loss mitigation mechanism its recovery from the one seriously negative month in   in august demonstrates how the strategy is designed to recover from losses by taking advantage of the rising options premiums that

friday total return fund letter to partners for the fourth quarter ended december   dear fellow partner third friday total return fund – performance in  the third friday total return fund lp the “fund” earned a net return unaudited of  compared to  for the hfri fund weighted composite hedge fund index and a  total return for the sp  in the fourth quarter the fund earned a net return of  compared to  for the hfri fund weighted composite hedge fund index and  for the sp  since inception in may  the fund has earned a net annualized return audited through  of  compared with a net annualized return of  for the hfri composite hedge fund index and an annualized total return of  for the sp  a complete statistical analysis of the fund’s performance since inception is attached to this letter we wrote you recently in view of the unusual volatility with which markets have started the year to let you know that third friday is weathering the storm extremely well the fund is well hedged and even better hedged than it was last august when the market experienced a similar downdraft third friday total return fund – strategy third friday was one of the best performing hedge funds in  particularly when its returns are evaluated on a riskadjusted basis the fund employs no leverage and ran cash positions of well over  throughout the year we decided to reduce our holdings of corporate bonds at the end of the year to zero in order to maximize the capital that can be invested in options in  in  our return suffered by approximately  basis points due because our corporate bond positions not only generated a small loss but also diverted about  million of capital investments in options that were generating  annualized returns we decided to reallocate this capital away from bonds and towards options at the end of the year in the expectation that the bond market will continue to underperform in  third friday was started as a family partnership and operated as such for several years until i joined the fund in november  to grow it into an institutional hedge fund the assets in the fund have grown by fold since then in addition we had over  million of total assets in the strategy at year end and our growth is accelerating we launched an offshore fund on july  and are in the process of preparing an insurance dedicated fund it should be noted that our returns should not suffer as a result of rapid growth unlike other strategies that encounter liquidity problems or require the generation of new ideas as they grow third friday simply applies the same investment strategy to a larger number of options straddles furthermore these straddles on the sp  index are among the most liquid instruments in the world accordingly the fund can accommodate significant growth without any diminution in liquidity or returns our world class service providers – auditor rsm llp formerly known as mcgladrey llp law firm haynesboone and administrator ssc – and our own professional staff are focused on producing superior riskadjusted returns for all our partners as we actively grow the fund the general partner is committed to reinvest virtually all of its performance fees in the fund for the duration of its life as an expression of its commitment to our partners and our belief in the strategy third friday total return fund – market outlook in  most hedge funds mutual funds and other investments generated disappointing returns i wrote in january  in the credit strategist that the thesis that a bear market cannot occur without the onset of a bear market and aggressive fed tightening would be questioned at the zero bound that thesis was tested and it flunked as the stock market experienced a stealth bear market and the high yield bond market basically crashed today the majority of stocks in the sp  are trading  below their  week highs the definition of a bear market arguments promulgated by wall street economists and the mainstream media last year that stocks would rise oil prices would recover and low oil prices would benefit the economy – all of which i challenged repeatedly in the credit strategist – proved to be wrong instead stocks struggled oil prices dropped further and low oil prices turned out to be bad news for the us economy unfortunately more of the same is likely in store for investors in  add to that an increasingly unstable geopolitical situation and you have a recipe for further market losses investors in third friday however need not worry about these problems third friday doesn’t generate its returns from the direction of the market instead it extracts returns from the volatility and time value embedded in options while i have every confidence in my market calls third friday’s returns do not rely on them being correct instead third friday relies on execution of a strategy that has been developed and perfected over the last  years through many difficult markets we proved this again in  by experiencing only two negative months one by only  while the sp  was negative in  of the  months of the year further we demonstrated in our recovery from our one seriously negative month  in august how our strategy is designed to recover from losses by taking advantage of the rising options premiums that naturally follow bad months to generate higher returns in the subsequent months this builtin feature of the strategy mitigates losses and protects capital conclusion there are very few ways for any investor whether an institution or an individual to earn consistent high single digitlow double digit returns in liquid strategies in any market environment that is particularly true in today’s world there are few if any strategies that can compete with either the riskadjusted returns or the shortterm liquidity that third friday offers most hedge funds require investors to lock up their money invest capital in a limited number of concentrated positions employ high amounts of leverage pay much higher fees and at the end of the day produce lower riskadjusted returns with much higher volatility and much lower liquidity and we have been doing this consistently for more than eight years in the fund and much longer in separate accounts i would like to thank all of our partners and service providers for their support we are actively seeking new investors to the fund and welcome referrals
