minarick senior counsel at   or janet m grossnickle assistant director at   division of investment management office of investment company regulation end further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  each trust is organized as a massachusetts business trust and is registered under the act as an openend management investment company each trust may consist of one or more series and may offer additional series in the future “funds” mfs a delaware corporation is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  and start printed page serves as the investment adviser to each fund  some funds including money market funds that rely on rule a under the act “money market funds” may lend money to banks or other entities by entering into repurchase agreements purchasing other shortterm instruments or in the case of funds other than the money market funds investing in the mfs institutional money market fund “immf” pursuant to rule d under the act other funds may borrow money from the same or similar banks for temporary purposes to satisfy redemption requests to cover unanticipated cash shortfalls such as a trade “fail” in which cash payment for a security sold by a fund has been delayed or for other temporary purposes currently the trusts have a committed credit facility provided by a syndicate of lenders and uncommitted lines of credit with two separate banks collectively the “loan agreements” the funds also have an overdraft facility with their custodians  if a fund were to borrow money under a loan agreement the fund would pay interest on the borrowed cash at a rate which would be higher than the rate that would be earned by other nonborrowing funds on investments in repurchase agreements and other shortterm instruments of the same maturity as the bank loan in addition while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails the borrowing funds incur commitment fees andor other charges involved in obtaining a bank loan  applicants request an order that would permit each trust to enter into master interfund lending agreements “interfund lending agreements” that would permit each fund to lend and borrow money for temporary purposes directly to and from each other fund through a credit facility “interfund loan” applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would reduce the funds borrowing costs and enhance their ability to earn higher interest rates on shortterm lendings although the proposed credit facility would reduce the funds need to borrow from banks the funds would be free to establish or renew committed lines of credit or other borrowing arrangements with unaffiliated banks  applicants anticipate that the credit facility would provide a borrowing fund with significant savings when the cash position of the fund is insufficient to meet temporary cash requirements this situation could arise when redemptions exceed anticipated volumes and certain funds have insufficient cash on hand to satisfy such redemptions when a fund liquidates portfolio securities to meet redemption requests it often does not receive payment in settlement for up to three days or longer for certain foreign transactions the credit facility would provide a source of immediate shortterm liquidity pending settlement of the sale of portfolio securities  applicants also propose using the credit facility when a sale of securities “fails” due to circumstances such as a delay in the delivery of cash to a funds custodian or improper delivery instructions by the broker effecting the transaction sales fails may present a cash shortfall if a fund has undertaken to purchase securities using the proceeds from the securities sold as a result the fund could fail on its intended purchase due to lack of funds from the previous sale resulting in additional cost to the fund or sell a security on a sameday settlement basis earning a lower return on the investment use of the credit facility under these circumstances would enable the fund to have access to immediate shortterm liquidity  while bank borrowings generally can supply needed cash to cover unanticipated redemptions and sales fails under the proposed credit facility a borrowing fund would pay lower interest rates than those offered by banks on shortterm loans in addition funds making shortterm cash loans directly to other funds would earn interest at a rate higher than they otherwise could obtain from investing their cash in repurchase agreements thus applicants believe that the proposed credit facility would benefit both borrowing and lending funds  the interest rate charged to a fund on any interfund loan “interfund loan rate” would be the average of the “repo rate” and the “bank loan rate” both as defined below the repo rate on any day would be the highest rate available to a lending fund from investing in overnight repurchase agreements the bank loan rate on any day would be calculated by the “interfund lending committee” as defined below each day an interfund loan is made according to a formula established by each funds board of trustees “fund board” intended to approximate the lowest interest rate at which bank shortterm loans would be available to the funds the formula would be based upon a publicly available rate eg federal funds rates andor libor plus an additional spread of basis points and would vary with this rate so as to reflect changing bank loan rates the initial formula and any subsequent modifications to the formula would be subject to the approval of each fund board each fund board would at least annually review the continuing appropriateness of using the method of calculating the bank loan rate as well as the relationship between the bank loan rate and current bank loan rates that would be available to the funds  the credit facility would be administered by investment professionals and administrative personnel from mfs the “interfund lending committee” no portfolio manager including research analysts with portfolio management responsibilities for any fund will serve as a member of the interfund lending committee under the proposed credit facility senior members of mfs investment management team and senior administrative and management personnel the “investment management committee” or a portfolio manager for each participating fund could provide standing instructions to the interfund lending committee that the participating fund is authorized to participate as a borrower or lender alternatively the portfolio manager could provide instructions from time to time as to when the fund wishes to participate as a borrower or a lender the interfund lending committee no more frequently than once daily in the morning of each business day that a transaction is requested under the credit facility pursuant to instructions an “interfund lending day” would request and collect data on the uninvested cash and borrowing requirements of all participating funds from the funds custodian once it has determined the aggregate amount of cash available for loans and borrowing demand the interfund lending committee would allocate loans among borrowing funds without any further communication from a funds portfolio managers applicants expect there will typically be more available uninvested cash each day than borrowing demand after the interfund lending committee start printed page has allocated cash for interfund loans mfs cash desk personnel would invest any remaining cash in accordance with the funds investment policies and practices in the ordinary course  the interfund lending committee would allocate borrowing demand and cash available for lending among the funds on what the interfund lending committee believes to be an equitable basis subject to certain administrative considerations applicable to all participating funds such as the time of filing requests to participate minimum loan lot sizes the need to minimize the number of transactions and associated administrative costs and the amount of the existing borrowings outstanding to reduce transaction costs each interfund loan normally would be allocated in a manner intended to minimize the number of participants necessary to complete the loan transaction the method of allocation and related administrative procedures would be approved by each fund board including a majority of trustees who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined in section a of the act “independent fund board members” to ensure that both borrowing and lending funds participate on an equitable basis  the interfund lending committee would a monitor the interfund loan rates charged and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans b limit the borrowings and loans entered into by each fund to ensure that they comply with the funds investment policies and limitations c ensure equitable treatment of each fund and d directly or through mfs make quarterly reports to each fund board concerning any transactions by the funds under the credit facility and the interfund loan rate charged  mfs through the interfund lending committee would administer the credit facility as a fiduciary as part of its duties under the investment management contract with each fund and provide administrative support pursuant to the administrative services agreement between each fund and mfs and would receive no additional fee as compensation for its services  no fund may participate in the credit facility unless a the fund has obtained shareholder approval for its participation if such approval is required by law b the fund has fully disclosed all material information concerning the credit facility in its prospectus andor statement of additional information “sai” and c the funds participation in the credit facility is consistent with its investment objectives limitations and organizational documents  in connection with the credit facility applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting relief from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting relief from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting relief from sections a a and a of the act and d under section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from a registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person if that person controls or is under common control with the company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person applicants state that the funds may be under common control by virtue of having mfs as their common investment adviser andor by having a common fund board and officers  section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the act and with the general purposes of the act applicants believe that the proposed arrangements satisfy these standards for the reasons discussed below  applicants submit that sections a and b of the act were intended to prevent a party with strong potential adverse interests to and some influence over the investment decisions of a registered investment company from causing or inducing the investment company to engage in lending transactions that unfairly inure to the benefit of such party and that are detrimental to the best interests of the investment company and its shareholders applicants assert that the proposed credit facility transactions do not raise these concerns because a mfs through the interfund lending committee would administer the program as a fiduciary b all interfund loans would consist only of uninvested cash reserves that the lending fund otherwise would invest in shortterm repurchase agreements or other shortterm instruments c the interfund loans would not involve a greater risk than such other investments d the lending fund would receive interest at a rate higher than it could otherwise obtain through such other investments and e the borrowing fund would pay interest at a rate lower than otherwise available to it under its bank loan agreements moreover applicants believe that the other terms and conditions in the application would effectively preclude the possibility of any fund obtaining an undue advantage over any other fund  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of an affiliated person from selling any securities or other property to the company section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act generally makes it unlawful for a registered investment company to purchase or otherwise acquire any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  applicants state that the obligation of a borrowing fund to repay an interfund loan may constitute a security for the purposes of sections a and d applicants also state that any pledge of assets in connection with an interfund loan could be construed as a purchase of the borrowing funds securities or other property for purposes of section a of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exemption is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors applicants contend that the standards under sections c b and dj are satisfied for all the reasons set forth above in support of their request for relief from sections start printed page a and b and for the reasons discussed below applicants also state that the requested relief from section a of the act meets the standards of section c and b because any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan would be subject to the same conditions imposed by any other lender to a fund that imposes conditions on the quality of or access to collateral for a borrowing if the lender is another fund or the same or less restrictive conditions in any other circumstance any collateral pledged to secure an interfund loan will be available solely to secure repayment of such interfund loan  applicants state that among other things section d was intended to prevent the pyramiding of investment companies in order to avoid imposing on investors additional and duplicative costs and fees attendant upon multiple layers of investment companies applicants submit that the proposed credit facility does not involve these abuses applicants note that there will be no duplicative costs or fees to the funds or shareholders and that mfs will receive no additional compensation for its services in administering the credit facility through the interfund lending committee applicants also note that the entire purpose of the proposed credit facility is to provide economic benefits for all of the participating funds and their shareholders  section f of the act prohibits openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank provided that immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness applicants request relief from section f to the limited extent necessary to implement the credit facility because the lending funds are not banks  applicants believe that granting relief under section c is appropriate because the funds would remain subject to the requirement of section f that all borrowings of a fund including combined interfund and bank borrowings have at least  asset coverage based on the conditions and safeguards described in the application applicants also submit that to allow the funds to borrow from other funds pursuant to the proposed credit facility is consistent with the purposes and policies of section f  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transactions in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants submit that the purpose of section d is to avoid overreaching by and unfair advantage to investment company insiders applicants believe that the credit facility is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act in that it offers both reduced borrowing costs and enhanced returns on loaned funds to all participating funds and their shareholders applicants note that each fund would have an equal opportunity to borrow and lend on equal terms consistent with its investment policies and fundamental investment limitations applicants therefore believe that each funds participation in the credit facility will be on terms that are no different from or less advantageous than that of other participating funds applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the interfund loan rate will be the average of the repo rate and the bank loan rate  on each business day that the interfund lending committee considers whether to use interfund loans the interfund lending committee will compare the bank loan rate with the repo rate and will make cash available for interfund loans only if the interfund loan rate is a more favorable to the lending fund than the repo rate and if applicable the yield of any money market fund approved by the investment management committee as a money market fund in which the lending fund could otherwise invest and b more favorable to the borrowing fund than the bank loan rate  if a fund has outstanding borrowings any interfund loans to the fund a will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan b will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral c will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan and in any event not over seven days and d will provide that if an event of default by the fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the fund that event of default will automatically without need for action or notice by the lending fund constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund lending agreement entitling the lending fund to call the interfund loan and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing fund  a fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the proposed credit facility if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total  or less of its total assets provided that if the fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender including but not limited to another fund the funds interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral if a funds total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than  of its total assets the fund may borrow through the proposed credit facility only on a secured basis a fund may not borrow through the proposed credit facility or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than  of its total assets  before any fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may through additional

manufacturing output construction activity and consumer confidence are all at multiyear highs auto sales are robust and us labor market reports show broad progress even a slowdown in the pace of rising house prices is seen as making the market more sustainable economists have a favorable outlook and broad stock indices reflect that however challenges dominate the rest of the global economy china is struggling to boost its industrial output and japans economic turnaround appears to have hit a setback after its sales tax increase in april the eurozone economy is being held back by persistently high unemployment and dangerously low inflation leading the european central bank to take more aggressive stimulus action with robust corporate earnings the markets greatest concerns relate to conflicts in the middle east and ukraine in addition speculation continues on when the us federal reserve will begin tightening its monetary policy now that the us economy has regained some

costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period march   through august   actual expenses the first line of the following table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled expenses paid during period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the following table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these transactional costs were

different from the market value of an instrument various inputs are used in determining the value of the funds assets or liabilities these inputs are categorized into three broad levels in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an investments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the funds assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers

board review of investment advisory agreement the investment company act of  requires that both the full board of trustees and a majority of the noninterested independent trustees voting separately annually approve the continuation of the funds investment advisory agreement with mfs the trustees consider matters bearing on the fund and its advisory arrangements at their meetings throughout the year including a review of performance data at each regular meeting in addition the independent trustees met several times over the course of three months beginning in may and ending in july  contract review meetings for the specific purpose of considering whether to approve the continuation of the investment advisory agreement for the fund and the other investment companies that the board oversees the mfs funds the independent trustees were assisted in their evaluation of the funds investment advisory agreement by independent legal counsel from whom they received separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from mfs during various contract review meetings the independent trustees were also assisted in this process by the mfs funds independent chief compliance officer a fulltime senior officer appointed by and reporting to the independent trustees in connection with their deliberations regarding the continuation of the investment advisory agreement the trustees including the independent trustees considered such information and factors as they believed in light of the legal advice furnished to them and their own business judgment to be relevant the investment advisory agreement for the fund was considered separately although the trustees also took into account the common interests of all mfs funds in their review as described below the trustees considered the nature quality and extent of the various investment advisory administrative and shareholder services performed by mfs under the existing investment advisory agreement and other arrangements with the fund as part of their deliberations the trustees took into account that the fund was formed solely to act as a cash sweep vehicle for other mfs funds and that shares of the fund are not distributed or sold to the public the trustees gave substantial consideration to the fact that mfs does not charge a separate advisory fee to the fund under the investment advisory agreement or charge transfer agency fees administrative services fees sales loads or distribution and service fees to the fund but that mfs receives advisory and other fees from the mfs funds that invest their cash balances in the fund in connection with their contract review meetings the trustees received and relied upon materials that included among other items i information provided by lipper inc an independent third party on the investment performance of the fund for various time periods ended december   and the investment performance of a group of funds with substantially similar investment classificationsobjectives the lipper performance universe ii information provided by lipper inc on the funds fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of comparable funds identified by lipper inc the lipper expense group iii information as to whether and to what extent applicable expense waivers and reimbursements are observed for the fund iv information regarding mfs financial results and financial condition including mfs and certain of its affiliates estimated profitability from services performed for the fund and the mfs funds as a whole and compared to mfs institutional business v mfs views regarding the outlook for the mutual fund industry and the strategic business    table of contents board review of investment advisory agreement  continued   plans of mfs vi descriptions of various functions performed by mfs for the funds such as compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices and vii information regarding the overall organization of mfs including information about mfs senior management and other personnel providing investment advisory administrative and other services to the fund and the other mfs funds the comparative performance fee and expense information prepared and provided by lipper inc was not independently verified and the independent trustees did not independently verify any information provided to them by mfs the trustees conclusion as to the continuation of the investment advisory agreement was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided to the trustees and not the result of any single factor some of the factors that figured particularly in the trustees deliberations are described below although individual trustees may have evaluated the information presented differently from one another giving different weights to various factors it is also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for the fund and other mfs funds are the result of years of review and discussion between the independent trustees and mfs that certain aspects of such arrangements may receive greater scrutiny in some years than in others and that the trustees conclusions may be based in part on their consideration of these same arrangements during the course of the year and in prior years based on information provided by lipper inc and mfs the trustees reviewed the funds total return investment performance as well as the performance of peer groups of funds over various time periods the trustees placed particular emphasis on the total return performance of the funds shares in comparison to the performance of funds in its lipper performance universe over the threeyear period ended december   which the trustees believed was a long enough period to reflect differing market conditions the total return performance of the funds shares was in the st quintile relative to the other funds in the universe for this threeyear period the st quintile being the best performers and the th quintile being the worst performers the total return performance of the funds shares was in the st quintile for the oneyear period and the nd quintile for the fiveyear period ended december   relative to the lipper performance universe because of the passage of time these performance results may differ from the performance results for more recent periods including those shown elsewhere in this report in the course of their deliberations the trustees took into account information provided by mfs in connection with the contract review meetings as well as during investment review meetings conducted with portfolio management personnel during the course of the year regarding the funds performance after reviewing these and related factors the trustees concluded within the context of their overall conclusions regarding the investment advisory agreement that they were satisfied with mfs responses and efforts relating to investment performance in assessing the reasonableness of the funds expenses the trustees considered among other information the total expense ratio of the funds shares as a percentage of average daily net assets and the total expense ratios of peer groups of funds based on information provided by lipper inc noting that the funds total expense ratio was expected to be relatively low because as noted above the fund does not bear advisory expenses the trustees considered that according to the lipper data which takes into    table of contents board review of investment advisory agreement  continued   account any expense limitations that were in effect during the funds last fiscal year the funds total expense ratio was lower than the lipper expense group median because the fund does not pay an advisory fee the trustees did not consider the extent to which economies of scale would be realized due to the funds growth of assets whether fee levels reflect economies of scale for the funds shareholders or the fees paid by similar funds to other investment advisers or by similar clients of mfs the trustees also considered information prepared by mfs relating to mfs costs and profits with respect to the fund the mfs funds considered as a group and other investment companies and accounts advised by mfs as well as mfs methodologies used to determine and allocate its costs to the mfs funds the fund and other accounts and products for purposes of estimating profitability in addition the trustees considered mfs resources and related efforts to continue to retain attract and motivate capable personnel to serve the fund the trustees also considered current and developing conditions in the financial services industry including the presence of large and wellcapitalized companies which are spending and appear to be prepared to continue to spend substantial sums to engage personnel and to provide services to competing investment companies in this regard the trustees also considered the financial resources of mfs and its ultimate parent sun life financial inc the trustees also considered the advantages and possible disadvantages to the fund of having an adviser that also serves other investment companies as well as other accounts the trustees also considered the nature quality cost and extent of administrative transfer agency and distribution services provided to the fund by mfs and its affiliates under agreements and plans other than the investment advisory agreement the trustees also considered the nature extent and quality of certain other services mfs performs or arranges for on the funds behalf which may include securities lending programs directed expense payment programs class action recovery programs and mfs interaction with thirdparty service providers principally custodians and subcustodians the trustees concluded that the various nonadvisory services provided by mfs and its affiliates on behalf of the fund were satisfactory the trustees also considered benefits to mfs from the use of the funds portfolio brokerage commissions if applicable to pay for investment research and various other factors additionally the trustees considered socalled fallout benefits to mfs such as reputational value derived from serving as investment manager to the fund based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material including those factors described above the board of trustees including the independent trustees concluded that the funds investment advisory agreement with mfs should be continued for an additional oneyear period commencing august      table of
