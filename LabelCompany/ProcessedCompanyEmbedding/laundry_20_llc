centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do

model is not userfriendly given the potentially large number of coins or tokens that may be required to enable a customer to wash and dry one or more loads of laundry some laundromats have attempted to eliminate the need for coins or tokens by providing value cards which may be purchased by customers a customer may purchase a value card of a certain monetary value to operate a washer or dryer the customer may insert the value card into a reader attached to the washer or dryer and the reader may deduct monetary value from the card and enable operation of the washer or dryer however this business model is also not userfriendly given that it may require the user to carry monetary value on a card thus rendering such monetary value unavailable to be spent by the user for other purposes

elementsdetailed descriptionthe present disclosure describes implementations for providing a laundry service one or more management server devices may generate and provide content that is presented in a user interface ui on a user device such as a mobile computing device for example the management server devices may communicate information to a user device and such information may be presented within a customer application eg a mobile app executing on the user device the customer application may enable a user to create a user account with the laundry service the user may login to the laundry service using the ui of the customer application and request availability information describing one or more laundry machines eg washers dryers and so forth that are currently available for use at one or more laundromat facilities the availability information may also indicate machines which are currently unavailable eg in use or reserved for use in some implementations the availability information may indicate currently available laundry machines in proximity to the current location of the user such as within a predetermined threshold distance eg  miles of the users current location or the current location of the user device the availability information may be presented in the ui of the customer application in a map andor other suitable ui element that indicates the locations of the laundromats with currently available laundry machinesthe user may select a laundromat through the ui of the customer application causing the customer application to send a reservation request to the management server devices the reservation request may indicate a number of laundry machines to be reserved at the userselected laundromat on receiving the reservation request one or more management modules executing on the management server devices may reserve one or more available laundry machines in the userselected laundromat for a predetermined period of time reserving the laundry machines may include updating status information that indicates a current status eg free in use or reserved of the various laundry machines managed by the laundry service reserving the laundry machines may also include sending one or more control signals that cause a status indicator on the reserved laundry machines to eg visually indicate the status of the laundry machines as reserved in some cases the control signals may also cause the door of the laundry machine to lock until the machine is requested by a user with a reservation in some implementations the control signals may cause the disabling of a control panel of the machine instead of locking the machine or in addition to locking the machine accordingly the control signals may cause the control panel of the machine to be disabled locked or otherwise unusable until the machine is requested by a user with a reservation the management server devices may also send a reservation response to the user device to inform the user that the requested number of laundry machines have been reserved at the userselected laundromat in some implementations the reservation may be valid for a predetermined period of time eg  minutes to allow the user sufficient time to reach the selected laundromatthe laundromat may include any number of laundry machines such as washers and dryers in some implementations each laundry machine may be configured to include a status indicator that indicates a current status of the laundry machine in some implementations the status indicator may indicate one of a plurality of statuses example statuses can include in use reserved or free implementations also support the use of more or fewer possible statuses for laundry machines a status indicator may indicate that the laundry machine is in use and currently being used to wash or dry laundry a status indicator may indicate that the laundry machine is reserved based on a previous reservation request from a user a status indicator may indicate that the laundry machine is free such that a user may employ the laundry machine for doing laundry as used herein a free status may indicate that a laundry machine is available free is not limited to describing machines that are useable without payment eg free of charge a status indicator may indicate the status visually or through other means eg audio or haptic indicationsthe user may select to use one or more laundry machines in the laundromat for which the status indicators indicate a status of free reserved andor otherwise available for use by the user in some implementations a laundry machine may be configured to include a transceiver that emits a beacon signal in some cases the transceiver may be configured to emit a beacon signal that conforms to a version of a wireless communication protocol example wireless communication protocols can include bluetooth™ bluetooth low energy™ a field communication nfc protocol other radio frequency rf communications protocols and so forth the beacon signal may include an identifier of the particular laundry machine that emitted the beacon signal the user may select a laundry machine to use by moving the user device into proximity with the transceiver or beacon of the laundry machine the user device may detect the beacon signal through a wireless network interface of the user device and based on the received signal level being at least a threshold level the customer application may determine that the user device is within a threshold distance of the laundry machine in some cases this movement of the user device into proximity with the laundry machine may be described as a bump and may include the user device coming into physical contact with the beacon of the laundry machine in some cases the user device may not touch the laundry machine but may be brought close enough eg  inches to enable the customer application to infer based on the received signal level of the beacon signal that the user has selected the laundry machine to usethe wireless network interface of the user device may be a rf receiver transmitter andor transceiver that is configured to receive andor send communications over a wireless network using any suitable wireless communication protocolalthough examples herein may describe using rf communications to determine proximity of the user device to the laundry machine other techniques may also be employed in some implementations the machine may emit some other type of beacon signals such as an optical eg visible light indicator infrared beacon sound and so forth the user device may detect the emitted beacon signal and based on detecting the signal may determine that the user device is in proximity to the laundry machineimplementations may also employ other techniques to determine that the user is in proximity to the laundry machine andor that the user has selected the particular laundry machine for use for example a laundry machine may display a numeric code alphanumeric code or other type of code the code may be printed on a decal that is affixed to the laundry machine in some implementations the code is presented in a led display or other type of display that is a component of the laundry machine or that is otherwise associated with the laundry machine the user may enter the code into the ui of the customer application to indicate the users request to use the machine the code may be presented on the laundry machine or in proximity to the laundry machine to indicate that the code identifies or is otherwise associated with the laundry machine the code may uniquely identify the laundry machine among the set of laundry machines in the laundromat or among the set of laundry machines managed by the laundry servicein some implementations the code may be a scannable code such as a onedimensional barcode twodimensional eg matrix barcode scannable alphanumeric code and so forth the code may be arranged according to any suitable format such as a version of the universal product code upc the quick response qr code and so forth in such instances the user may use their user device to capture an image of the code or otherwise scan the code eg using a camera or other image capture component the scannable code may be decoded to retrieve information that uniquely identifies the laundry machine the customer application may send a request to use the machine and the request may include the machines code that was entered into the user application andor scanned the scannable code may be presented on the laundry machine or in proximity to the laundry machine to indicate that the scannable code is particularly associated with the laundry machine the information encoded in the scannable code may uniquely identify the laundry machine among the set of laundry machines in the laundromat or among the set of laundry machines managed by the laundry servicein response to determining that the user device has been brought into proximity with the laundry machine the customer application may send a machine request to the management server devices to request use of the laundry machine the machine request may be sent over a wide area network wan such as the internet the machine request may include the identifier of the particular laundry machine on receiving the machine request the management modules executing on the management server devices may determine whether the laundry machine is available for use based on status information indicating that the status of the laundry machine is free or reserved if the laundry machine is available the management server devices may send one or more control signals to a network location eg network address of the laundry machine the control signals may instruct the laundry machine to alter its operational state to enable use of the laundry machine for a period of time the period of time may correspond to a wash cycle if the laundry machine is a washer for example the period of time may correspond to one or more increments of drying time eg  minute increments if the laundry machine is a dryer for examplein some implementations the user may specify one or more payment methods through the customer application the payment methods may include but are not limited to one or more of a credit card a bank account a phone service account a cryptographic currency account eg bitcoin™ or an online payment processing service account eg paypal™ in exchange for use of the laundry machines the user may authorize payment to be made to the laundry service using the specified payment methods in this way implementations may provide a laundry service that does not require the user to carry large numbers of coins or to carry a large balance on a value card providing a more convenient secure and positive user experience than traditional laundromatsin some implementations access to the laundromat may be limited to those individuals who have a reservation or are registered customers of the laundry service for example the customer application may cause the user device to send an access request when the user device is in proximity to doors of the laundromat and the access request may cause the management modules to instruct the doors to open if the user is authorized to access the laundromat in this manner implementations provide a laundromat environment in which customers may feel safer than in a traditional eg publicly accessible unstaffed and unmonitored laundromatas used herein laundry may describe any number of items of clothing of any type including but not limited to pants shirts dresses skirts kilts trousers shorts belts suspenders socks hosiery undergarments diapers bibs shirts blouses gloves hats coats jackets

implementations such as those of the present disclosure as shown in fig  the system may operate with respect to a laundromat  the laundromat  may include any number of laundry machines  in the example shown the laundromat  includes laundry machines a that are washers and laundry machines b that are dryers implementations may also operate with respect to laundromats  that include washers but no dryers or that include dryers but no washers the laundromat  may also include other types of laundry machines  without limitation the laundromat  may include one or more sets of doors  that provide ingress to and egress from the laundromat a user  may approach the doors  of the laundromat  carrying a computing device such as a mobile device  the mobile device  may be any type of computing device including but not limited to a smartphone tablet computer laptop computer electronic book reader wearable computer eg watch glasses etc implanted computer vehicle computer eg automotive computer and so forth the mobile device  may execute a customer application that is configured to interact with management server devices that manage the laundry service in some cases prior to visiting the laundromat  the user  may have employed the customer application on the mobile device  to sign up as a customer of the laundry service in some cases the user  may have employed a different application eg executing on a desktop computer to sign up as a customer of the laundry service the user  may have logged into the laundry service using the customer application executing on the mobile device  prior to approaching the doors  of the laundromat in some implementations on reaching the laundromat  the user  may employ the customer application executing on the mobile device  to gain access to the laundromat  for example the laundromat  may include a beacon  eg a transceiver device arranged in proximity to the doors  of the laundromat  the beacon  may emit a wireless beacon signal in some implementations the beacon signal may comply with a wireless communication protocol example wireless communication protocols can include any appropriate version of the bluetooth™ wireless technology standard managed by the bluetooth special interest group sig and previously standardized by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ieee in ieee  in some implementations the beacon signal may comply with any appropriate version of the bluetooth low energy™ standard managed by the bluetooth sig bluetooth low energy™ marketed as bluetooth smart™ enables communications over a similar range as bluetooth™ but with lower power consumption both the bluetooth™ and bluetooth low energy™ standards are described in versions  and later of the bluetooth core specification promulgated by the bluetooth sig implementations also support the use of any nfc protocol or other wireless communication protocols for the beacon signal as described above implementations may employ other types of beacon signals such as visible light signals infrared signals and so forth implementations may also employ optical methods of proximity detection such as a numeric andor alphanumeric code affixed to the machine a scannable eg qr code and so forth as described abovebased on the detection of the beacon signal by a wireless network interface of the mobile device  the customer application may determine that the mobile device  is within a threshold distance of the doors  for example the customer application may infer that the mobile device  is within a threshold distance of the doors  based at least in part on a received signal level eg signal strength of the beacon signal in response to the detection of the beacon signal the mobile device  may send an access request to management server devices not shown in fig  executing management modules that perform operations to provide the laundry service such management server devices may be physically located at the laundromat  or may be at a location that is geographically remote from the laundromat  based on a determination that the user  is authorized to access the laundromat  the management server devices may send a control signal to instruct a door mechanism  to cause the doors  to open and admit the user  in some implementations the door mechanism  may include a network interface to enable the control signal to be sent from the management server devices to the door mechanism  in some implementations the access request may be sent to the management server devices without any interaction of the user  with the ui of the customer application to enable access even when the users hands are full carrying laundry in some cases when an attendant is staffing the laundromat  the doors  may open without receiving the control signal described above controlling user access to the laundromat is described further with reference to fig as shown in fig  the laundromat  may include any number of laundry machines  such as washers and dryers in some implementations one or more of the laundry machines  may include a status indicator  indicating a current status of the laundry machine  such as whether the laundry machine  is free in use or reserved in some implementations the status indicator  may indicate status using a visible mechanism for example the status indicator  may include a lightemitting diode led such as a multicolor led the led may emit different colors of light corresponding to possible statuses for example the led may emit green light to indicate that the laundry machine  is free red light to indicate that the laundry machine is in use and blue light to indicate that the laundry machine  is reserved implementations also support the use of other types of status indicators  such as status indicators  that visually indicate status using displayed symbols words and so forth in some cases a status indicator  may include a mechanism such that different positions or movements of the mechanism may indicate different statuses implementations also support the use of status indicators  that indicate status using nonvisual methods for example a status indicator  may emit different audible sounds to indicate different statuses as another example a status indicator  may perform different vibrations motions or other haptic outputs to indicate different statusesbased on the indicated statuses of the various laundry machines  the user  may select one or more laundry machines  to use the users selection of laundry machines  for use may be based at least in part on whether the user  previously requested a reservation of laundry machines  for example if the user  previously requested a reservation of one or more laundry machines  in the laundromat  the user  may be allowed to use laundry machines  that have a status of reserved or free if the user  came to the laundromat  without having previously requested a reservation the user  may be allowed to use laundry machines  that have a status of free in some implementations the customer application executing on the user device  may present information describing the locations of available laundry machines  in the laundromat  such information may be presented in a schematic or map of the laundromat  or any other type of wayfinding information the user  may approach the laundry machines  and request to use the laundry machines  by moving eg bumping the mobile device  into proximity with the beacon  of each selected laundry machine  as described further with reference to fig fig  depicts an example system for providing a laundry service in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure as shown in the example of fig  the user  may select to use a laundry machine  by approaching the laundry machine  and moving the mobile device  into proximity with the beacon  of the laundry machine  as described above the beacon  may include a wireless transceiver that emits a beacon signal conforming to a version of a wireless communication protocol such as a version of bluetooth™ or bluetooth low energy™ or any nfc protocol the beacon signal may include an identifier of the particular laundry machine  that emitted the beacon signal in some implementations the identifier included in the beacon signal may be encrypted and may change periodically to prevent someone from spoofing the laundry machines  and generating erroneous chargesalthough fig  illustrates implementations in which the user moves their mobile device  into proximity with the beacon  to select the laundry machine  implementations are not limited to this example as described above in some implementations the machine may present a numeric or alphanumeric code eg in a led display or affixed decal and he user may enter the code into the ui of the customer application to select the machine  in some implementations the machine may present a scannable code such as a dimensional or dimensional eg matrix barcode scannable alphanumeric text scannable symbol and so forth the user may select the machine by scanning the code using an image capture component of the mobile device a wireless network interface of the mobile device  may detect the beacon signal and based on the received signal level being at least a threshold level the customer application may determine that the mobile device  is within a threshold distance of the laundry machine  the moving of the mobile device  into proximity with the beacon  may be described as a bump and may or may not include physical contact between the mobile device  and the laundry machine  accordingly a bump may be a touch of the mobile device  to a portion of the laundry machine  and a bump may also include a movement that brings the mobile device  into proximity eg  inches with the laundry machine  without touching the laundry machine in some implementations if the customer application detects that the mobile device  based on a satellitebased navigation system eg gps or other location information and if the customer application determines that bluetooth or bluetooth low energy communications are not currently enabled on the mobile device  the customer application may prompt the user to activate the appropriate transceiver to communicate via bluetooth bluetooth low energy or other protocols in cases where the os of the mobile device  is configured to activate a transceiver automatically the customer application may send a request to the os to cause activation of the transceiver for bluetooth or bluetooth low energy communicationsin response to determining that the mobile device  has been brought into proximity with the laundry machine  the customer application may send a machine request to the one or more management server devices  to request use of the laundry machine  the management server devices  may include any number and any type of computing device in some cases the management server devices  may be physically located in the laundromat  in some cases the management server devices  may be remote from the laundromat  located at one or more geographically different locations than the laundromat  the machine request may be sent to the management server devices  over networks  the networks  may include wired or wireless networks and may include any number of wans eg the internet the networks  may also include any number of local area networks lans in some implementations the machine request may include the identifier of the particular laundry machine  that the user  is requesting to usethe management server devices  may execute one or more management modules  the management modules  may receive the machine request on receiving the machine request the management modules  may determine whether the laundry machine  is available for use based on status information  the status information  may describe the current status of any number of laundry machines  associated with the laundry service if the status information  indicates that the laundry machine  is free the machine request may be approved if the status information  indicates that the laundry machine  is reserved the machine request may be approved if the user  previously submitted a reservation request which resulted in the reservation of laundry machines if the management modules  approve the machine request the management modules  may cause one or more control signals to be sent to a network address of the laundry machine  the control signals may instruct the laundry machine  to alter its operational state to enable use of the laundry machine  for a period of time the period of time may correspond to a wash cycle if the laundry machine  is a washer the period of time may correspond to one or more increments of drying time eg  minute increments if the laundry machine  is a dryer in some implementations the sending of the control signals to enable use of the laundry machines  may be further based on a successful processing of a payment from the user  to the laundry service using one or more payment methods previously set up by the user  the bump of the mobile device  at the laundry machines  and subsequently enabling use of the laundry machines  is further described with reference to figs a b and  in some instances payment may not be required and the use of the laundry machines may be provided for free eg as a promotion as part of a test eg beta test and so forth in some instances the attendant may use the attendant app to enable use of machines without requiring the user payment in some implementations commands may be sent to the laundry machine  from the management server devices  andor other remote devices for diagnostics testing andor other purposesalthough examples herein describe placing the laundry machine  into a particular state based on a successful processing of a payment from the user  to the laundry service implementations are not so limited in some implementations the laundry machine  may be in one of two states—enabled or disabled a machine  may be disabled until it receives a control signal that enables the machine  and the control signal may be sent in response to a successful processing of a payment from the user  to the laundry service once the machine  is enabled the user may operate the machine  by selecting cycles temperatures wash or dry time andor other operational parameters and by starting and stopping the machine  as needed in some implementations the machine  may be enabled for a particular period of time in response to a particular payment for example the user may rent a machine  for two hours in exchange for a particular amount and the machine  may be enabled for two hours in response to a successful processing of the paymentfig  depicts an example system for providing a laundry service in accordance with

mobile device  and a portion eg the beacon  of the laundry machine  in some cases a bump may be detected if the mobile device  does not contact the laundry machine  but is within the threshold distance of the laundry machine  as indicated by the received signal level of the beacon signal  being at least a threshold levelon determining that the mobile device  is within a threshold distance of the laundry machine  the customer application  may infer that the user  is selecting the laundry machine  for use the customer application  may cause a machine request  to be communicated to the management server devices  in some implementations the machine request  may be communicated to the management server devices  over a wan such as the internet the machine request  may include the identifier of the laundry machine  in some cases the machine request  may include an indication of the laundromat  where the laundry machine  is located the machine request  may be received by the management server devices  and accessed by management modules  executing on the management server devices the management modules  may access status information  stored on the management server devices  or elsewhere the status information  may list for each laundry machine  managed within the laundry service a current status of the laundry machine  for example the status information  may indicate that a laundry machine  is currently free currently in use or currently reserved for other users if the user  previously reserved a laundry machine  at the laundromat  the machine request  may be approved by the management modules  if the current status of the userselected laundry machine  is free or reserved if the user  did not previously reserve a laundry machine  at the laundromat  the machine request  may be approved if the current status of the userselected laundry machine  is free if the current status of the userselected laundry machine  is in use the machine request  may be deniedin some cases the user  may login to the customer application  by entering one or more credentials such as a user name password and so forth in some cases the user  may be authenticated by the management modules  based on credentials provided with the machine request  or in a previously sent communication the approval of the machine request  may be further based on whether the user  has been authenticated as an authorized user of the laundry service in some implementations the approval of the machine request  may also be contingent on the successful processing of a payment from the user  to the laundry serviceif the machine request  is denied the management modules  may generate a message that is communicated for presentation on the customer application  the message may indicate that the machine request  for the particular laundry machine  has been denied eg because the laundry machine  is already in use or reserved for other users in that case the user  may be instructed to bump a different laundry machine  such as a laundry machine  with an indicated status of free or reserved eg if the user  has a reservationif the machine request  is approved the management modules  may update the status information  to indicate for the laundry machine  a current status of in use the management modules  may generate one or more control signals  that are communicated to the laundry machine  in some implementations the laundry machine  may have a network address such as an internet protocol ip address the management modules  may determine the particular network address that is associated with the laundry machine identifier and cause the control signals  to be sent to the network address of the laundry machine  in some implementations the management modules  may determine the network address based on address information stored in a table or other data structure the address information may list for each laundry machine  a network address of the laundry machine  in the form of an ip address or other address in some implementations the control signals  may be sent to a eg local server device that is configured to manage the laundry machines  in the laundromat  and the eg local server device may forward the control signals  to the laundry machine  in some implementations the control signals  may be communicated to the laundry machine  over a wan eg the internet and may be received by the network interfaces a the control signals  may instruct the microcontroller  to alter an operational state of the laundry machine  from its previous state eg free or reserved to a current state eg in use the control signals  may instruct the microcontroller to set the state of the machine  to any appropriate state including but not limited to free reserved or in use altering the operational state may include sending an instruction to cause the status indicator  to indicate a status of in use altering the operational state may also include sending an instruction to the control modules  to cause the door of the laundry machine  to unlock or to cause the control modules  to mechanically or electrically enable the laundry machine  to perform operations to process laundry in some implementations altering the operational state of the machine  may include enabling or disabling a control panel andor one or more controls of the machine  the microcontroller  may send other instructions to the control modules  to enable the use of the laundry machine  in some implementations the control signals  may cause the microcontroller  to enable use of the laundry machine  during a predetermined period of time for example in cases where the laundry machine  is a washer the laundry machine  may be enabled for use during a wash cycle of the laundry machine  in cases where the laundry machine  is a dryer the laundry machine  may be enabled for use during one or more increments of time eg  minute increments associated with the dryerin some implementations the customer application  may determine whether a bumped laundry machine  is available for use for example the beacon signal  may include an identifier of the laundry machine  as well as an indication of the current status of the laundry machine  if the customer application  determines that the current status is in use based on the beacon signal  the customer application  may present a notification indicating that the selected laundry machine  is currently in use if the customer application  determines that the current status is reserved and if the user  does not have a reservation at the laundromat  the customer application  may present a notification indicating that the selected laundry machine  is reserved for other usersfig  depicts an example system for providing a laundry service in accordance with implementations of the present disclosure fig  depicts an example system in which the management server devices  act as an intermediary between the users mobile device  and the laundry machine  fig  depicts an example system in which the interaction between the mobile device  and the laundry machine  is substantially more direct and not intermediated by management server devices  in the example of fig  the laundry machine  may emit the beacon signal  which is detected at the customer application  on determining based on the beacon signal  that the mobile device  is in proximity to the laundry machine  the mobile device  may establish a connection with the microcontroller  via the network interfaces b the customer application  may use the connection to send control signals  to request the use of the laundry machine  during a predetermined period of time in implementations that support this more direct eg peertopeer communication between the mobile device  and the laundry machine  the network interfaces b may support communication via bluetooth™ or another protocol that enables the communication of more data than bluetooth low energy™ in the example of fig  the laundry machine  may not have a direct eg wan connection to the management server devices  and may instead use the user devices network connection to indirectly communicate with the management server devices in some implementations the microcontroller  depicted in figs  and  may be a soc sip or other type of system that has been incorporated into the laundry machine  to enable the control of the laundry machine  from the management server devices  or the mobile device  the microcontroller  may be physically incorporated into the laundry machine  in some cases the microcontroller  may be external to the laundry machine  the microcontroller  may interface with the control modules  via a serial port such as a universal serial bus usb connection a parallel port an ethernet connection a ribbon cable eg multiwire planar cable or any other type of wired or wireless interface that enables the transfer of information between the microcontroller  and the control modules  in some cases the microcontroller  may interface with the control modules  using one or more of a generalpurpose inputoutput gpio connector a universal asynchronous receivertransmitter uart an interintegrated circuit ic or a serial peripheral interface spi the control modules  may be separate with respect to the microcontroller  or may be at least partly incorporated into the microcontroller  in some implementations the microcontroller  may be powered using the power provided to the laundry machine  in some implementations the microcontroller  may be powered independently from the laundry machine in some implementations the microcontroller  may be configured to enable use of the laundry machine  for an authorized user  in such cases the user  may use the existing controls of the laundry machine  to do laundry after the microcontroller  has enabled its use in some cases the microcontroller  may be configured to have more extensive control of the operations of the laundry machine  in such cases the user device  may effectively become the primary interface between the user  and the laundry machine  enabling the user  to control the operations of the laundry machine  with regard to cycle options temperature time of operation cycle selection water fill level detergent addition or other aspects one or both of the user device  or the management modules  may store user preference information regarding the various options to facilitate the users subsequent use of a laundry machine fig  depicts an example system for providing a laundry service in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure in some implementations a user  such as a customer of the laundry service may be presented with periodic updates regarding the progress of laundry in one or more laundry machines  of the laundromat  such updates may be presented in the customer application  and may indicate the number of loads in progress the laundry machine  being used for each load of laundry and the amount of time left to process the load on each laundry machine  the customer application  may also present an indication when each load is complete in some cases the periodic updates of laundry status may be sent eg peertopeer from the laundry machine  to the user device  without using the management server devices  as an intermediary in such cases the updates may be sent to the user device  even after the user device  has been moved away from the laundry machine  eg out of the threshold distance for bumping in some cases the periodic updates may be sent to the user device  from the management server devices  based on status information received at the management server devices  from the laundry machine or based on a known time period for the laundry cycle in some implementations the updates may be sent to the user device  from the management server devices  through an intermediary such as through one or more servers that facilitate push messaging to devices that run a particular operating system such as a version of ios™ android™ and so forththe customer application  may be configured to enable the user  to send one or more service requests  to request additional services to be performed with respect to the users laundry for example the service requests  may request one or more of the following addition of time to a laundry machine  such as more drying time or an additional wash cycle addition of detergent fabric softener dryer sheets or other items to a laundry machine  movement of laundry from one laundry machine  to another such as moving laundry from a washer to a dryer and starting a dry cycle removal of laundry from a laundry machine  folding of laundry storage of laundry pending the return of the user  delivery of laundry to the users home or other location and so forth each of these additional services may be available to the user  for an additional payment which may be processed by the management modules  in some cases the laundry service may also provide an additional service to pick up laundry from the user  the users laundry may then be done by an attendant and either delivered to the user  or held for pickup by the user the management modules  may access the service requests  received at the management server devices  and if payment is processed successfully the management modules  may generate one or more service instructions  that are sent to a mobile device  of a user  in some instances payment may not be required and the services may be provided for free eg as a promotion as part of a test eg beta test and so forth in some instances the attendant may provide such services without requiring the user payment the user  may be an attendant eg employed by the laundry service who is on site at the laundromat  the service instructions  may instruct the user  to perform the additional services requested in the service requests  in some implementations the user  may be presented with the service instructions  on an attendant application that executes on the attendants mobile device  the attendant application may be a different application than the customer application  or may be a same application with a different set of exposed features in performing the additional services for the user  the attendant user  may act as a proxy for a customer user  the attendant application may be configured to perform operations including but not limited to the following authenticate the attendant to the laundry service present a current number of customers in the laundromat  present a status summary of the laundry machines  in the laundromat  present additional information regarding the laundry machines  process refunds to customers present notifications of additional services to be performed present information regarding reservations at the laundromat  send a message eg text message to a customer or present a predicted level of activity in the laundromat  based on historical data current reservations and a current number of customersby enabling the user  to submit service requests  for additional services implementations may provide a more positive and convenient customer experience for the user  for example the user  may start one or more loads of laundry and leave the laundromat  to go to their home their office a store a coffee shop or elsewhere and the user  may submit service requests  for further handling of their laundry while the user  is not present in the laundromat in some implementations the attendant may use the attendant application executing on the attendants mobile device  to perform actions that may not be permitted for a customer eg user  for example the attendant may be able to bump the mobile device  on a laundry machine  that is currently in use and use the attendant application to stop the laundry machine  unlock and open the door of the laundry machine  and remove the laundry to move to another laundry machine  in cases where the door of the laundry machine  may automatically lock while a cycle is in progress a customer may not be able to perform such actions accordingly the attendant application may provide a wider range of privileges to the attendant than those provided to a customerfig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for presenting availability information that describes available laundry machines  at laundromats  operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the customer application  other modules executing on the mobile device  the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  or other modules executing on other devicesthe customer application  executing on a user device such as the mobile device  or a desktop computing device may detect  an attempted login of the user  at the customer application  the user  may enter one or more credentials  such as a login password or other credentials through the ui of the customer application  the customer application  may communicate the credentials  to the management modules  executing on the management server devices the management modules  may authenticate  the user  by comparing the credentials  to credentials previously provided by the user  the management modules  may send to the user device a result indicating the success or failure of authentication of the user  the operations for authenticating the user  may be performed by software executing on the management server devices  or the user devicethe customer application  may determine  a location of the user device the location may be determined using any technique to any degree of specificity for example the user device may include location sensors transceivers other hardware components or other software components configured to determine the location using one or more of the following an inertial navigation system a deadreckoning navigation system a network positioning system a radio position finding system a satellitebased navigation system an accelerometer system a gyroscope system and so forth the satellitebased system may include one or more of a global positioning system gps receiver a globalnaya navigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema glonass receiver a galileo receiver an indian regional navigational satellite system and so forth the location may also be determined through geolocation based on an ip address of the user device in some cases the location of the user device or the user  may be determined based on previously collected information describing the user device or the user  such as a previously specified address of the user the customer application  may request  availability information  by communicating an availability request  to the management modules  the availability request  may request availability information  describing one or more currently available laundry machines  at one or more laundromats the management modules  may identify  one or more laundromats  that include currently available laundry machines  the laundromats being within a predetermined threshold distance of the location of the user device in some implementations this identification may be based on the status information  that indicates a current status eg free in use or reserved of laundry machines  managed within the laundry service for example the management modules  may identify those laundromats  that are located within  miles of the user device and that currently have available laundry machines  for use in some implementations the availability request  may indicate a number of laundry machines  that the user  may wish to use and the availability information  may describe those eg nearby laundromats  that have the desired number of currently available laundry machines the management modules  may send  or cause to be sent the availability  to the user device the availability information  may be presented  in the ui of the customer application  executing on the user devicefig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for reserving laundry machines  at laundromats  operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the customer application  other modules executing on the mobile device  the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  firmware or other software executing on the laundry machine  or other modules executing on other devicesthe customer application  may detect  a selection made by the user  through the ui of the customer application  the selection indicating a laundromat  the selected laundromat  may be one of the laundromats  indicated in the availability information  as having currently available laundry machines the customer application  may send  a reservation request  to request the reservation of one or more laundry machines  at the selected laundromat  in some implementations the customer application  may enable the user  to indicate a number of laundry machines  to reserve and the reservation request  may indicate the desired number of laundry machines  at the selected laundromat the management modules  may access the reservation request  and identify  the requested number of laundry machines  to reserve at the laundromat  this identification may be based at least in part on the status information  which indicates the currently free laundry machines  at the laundromat  in some implementations the determining of which laundry machines  to reserve may be made based at least in part on load balancing considerations for example the particular laundry machines  may be selected based on a determination that those laundry machines  are underused compared to other laundry machines  such a determination may be made based on an analysis of operational data collected from laundry machines  as described with reference to fig in some implementations when reserving a laundry machine  the management modules  may determine a laundry machine  to reserve based on information regarding when a current load is finishing andor when a machine finishes or is expected to finish operating in a certain status or statuses for example all the laundry machines  in a laundromat  may be currently in use but the status information  may indicate that one laundry machine  will be finishing in one minute the management modules  may reserve that laundry machine  given that the current load is expected to finish by the time the reserving user  arrives other information may also be considered such as information indicating that the previous user  has requested that their laundry be removed from the laundry machine  by an attendant or information that the previous user  of the laundry machine  is currently in the laundromat  and available to remove their laundry from the laundry machine  when the current cycle completesthe management modules  may update  the status information  to indicate the identified laundry machines  as reserved the management modules  may also send  or cause to be sent control signals  to alter the status indicators  of the laundry machines  the control signals  may be received by the microcontroller  of the laundry machines  and the microcontroller  may send a signal to alter  the status indicators  to indicate a reserved status for the laundry machines the management modules  may send  or cause to be sent reservation information  to the user device the reservation information  may indicate the reservation of the laundry machines  at the laundromat  the reservation information  may also indicate a period of time during which the reservation may be held for example the reservation information  may indicate that the laundry machines  will be reserved for use by the user  or by another user with a reservation for the next  minutes in some cases the period of time may be based at least partly on the distance of the user device from the laundromat  current traffic conditions time of day road conditions road access or other factors to ensure that the user  has sufficient time to reach the laundromat  before the reservation expiresthe reservation information  may be received at the user device and the customer application  may present  the reservation information  in the ui of the customer application  in cases where the management modules  were unable to reserve the requested number of laundry machines  due to lack of availability or other considerations the management modules  may respond to the reservation request  with a message describing a reason for the failed reservation such as the lack of availability of laundry machines  at the laundromat in some implementations the process depicted in fig  may determine laundromats  in proximity to the location without regard to whether such laundromats  have currently available laundry machines  in such cases the availability information  presented in the ui of the customer application  may indicate all the laundromats  in the vicinity without regard to machine availability the process depicted in fig  may receive the reservation request  indicating a desired number of laundry machines  and determine whether to approve or disapprove the reservation request  based on whether the selected laundromat  currently has at least the desired number of laundry machines  requestedfig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for providing access to a laundromat  operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the customer application  other modules executing on the mobile device  the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  or other modules executing on other devicesas described with reference to fig  a network interface of the users mobile device  may detect  a signal emitted by the beacon  in proximity to the doors  of the laundromat  the detection of the signal with a received signal level higher than a threshold level may indicate that the mobile device  is within a threshold distance of the doors  or otherwise in proximity to the doors the customer application  based on the detected signal may send  an access request  to request access to the laundromat  the management modules  may receive the access request  and determine  whether the user  has a previouslymade reservation for one or more laundry machines  in the laundromat  if so the process may proceed to  if not the management modules  may determine  whether the user  is an authenticated customer of the laundry service if not the process may deny  the access request  eg denying the user  access to the laundromat  in some cases denial of access may include sending a message to the mobile device  indicating a reason for the denial of access eg unauthorized user lack of reservation and so forth if it is determined at  that the user  is an authenticated customer of the laundry service the management modules  may send  a signal to cause the doors  to open and admit the user  to the laundromat in some implementations as in the example of fig  a user  may be admitted to a laundromat  if the user  has a reservation of one or more laundry machines  in the laundromat  or if the user  has no reservation but is a customer of the laundry service in some implementations a user  may not be admitted to a laundromat unless the user  has reserved laundry machines  in the laundromat  even if the user  is an authenticated customer of the laundry service although the example of fig  depicts the management server devices  operating as an intermediary to determine whether the user  is to be granted access to a laundromat  implementations are not so limited in some implementations the determination whether to admit a user  to a laundromat  may be made by software executing in the door mechanism  or some other computing device physically located in or in proximity to the laundromat  or on another computing device that is in communication with the door mechanism figs a and b depict an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure

the mobile device  the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  firmware or other software executing on the microcontroller  of the laundry machine  or other modules executing on other devicesthe laundry machine  may emit  a beacon signal  that indicates the presence of the laundry machine  in some implementations as described above the beacon signal  may include an identifier that eg uniquely identifies the laundry machine based on detecting the beacon signal  at the mobile device  the customer application  may determine  that the mobile device  is in proximity to the laundry machine  for example the mobile device  may be moved into proximity with a beacon  of the laundry machine  in a bump motion performed by the user  detection of the beacon signal  is described further with reference to fig the customer application  may extract the laundry machine identifier from the beacon signal  and send  a machine request  to request use of the laundry machine  in response to receiving the machine request  at the management server devices  the management modules  may access  the status information  indicating the current status of the various laundry machines  managed by the laundry servicebased on the status information  the management modules  may determine  the current status eg free in use or reserved of the laundry machine  that the mobile device  bumped with if the laundry machine  is currently in use the management modules  may send or cause to be sent an error message  in response to receiving the error message  the customer application  may indicate  that the laundry machine  is currently in use and request that the user  select another laundry machine  that is not in useif it is determined  that the laundry machine  is reserved the management modules  may determine  whether the user  previously made a reservation of at least one laundry machine  if not the management modules  may send or cause to be sent an error message  in response to receiving the error message  the customer application  may indicate  that the laundry machine  is current reserved for other customers and request that the user  select a free laundry machine if it is determined  that the laundry machine  is free or if it is determined  that the user  has previously reserved at least one laundry machine  the process may proceed as described with reference to fig bin some implementations the management modules  may process  a payment from the user  to the laundry service prior to enabling the laundry machine  for use by the user  if the payment is successfully processed the management modules  may update  the status information  to indicate that the laundry machine  is currently in use the management modules  may send  or cause to be sent a control signal  the control signal  may be sent to the laundry machine  in response to receiving the control signal  the microcontroller  may send a signal to alter  the status indicator  to indicate that the laundry machine  is currently in use the microcontroller  may also send one or more signals to the control modules  to alter  the operational state of the laundry machine  and to enable its use for doing laundrythe management modules  may send  or cause to be sent a status notification  indicating that the laundry machine  is now available for use the status notification  may also indicate an amount of time remaining in the current laundry cycle on the laundry machine the customer application  executing on the mobile device  may access the status notification  received at the mobile device  and present  the time remaining in the ui of the customer application in some implementations the customer application  may be configured to present  advertisements surveys games or other content via the ui of the customer application  while the laundry cycle is in progress in some implementations such content may be presented based on a determination that the user  is currently in the laundromat  presentation of additional content may provide a positive user experience by giving the user  something to do while waiting for their laundry to finish in some cases the laundry service may receive payment from advertisers advertising networks survey organizations or other parties based on the presentation of the content to users or based on the amount of time during which the content is presentedin some implementations in response to enabling the use of the laundry machine  for the user  the management modules  may automatically reserve  additional laundry machines  for subsequent use for example if the initially enabled laundry machine  is a washer the management modules  may automatically reserve one or more dryers for subsequent use by the user  based on an inference that the user  may want to dry their laundry after it is washed the additional laundry machines  may be automatically reserved at a time following the expiration of the period of time for use of the initial laundry machine  such as after the completion of a wash cyclein some implementations the laundry service processes a payment from the user  prior to enabling the user  to use laundry machines  in some cases the payment may be per use such that the user  authorizes a payment for each trip to the laundromat  in some cases the user  may have previously added value to an account managed by the laundry service and the laundry service may debit the account according to the value of services provided the laundry service may also offer a subscription plan in which the user  provided a predetermined periodic eg monthly payment in return for the use of laundry machines  or other services in some implementations the laundry service may enable multiple users  to share laundry machines  or other services and the payments may be split among the multiple users in some implementations the laundry service provides the ability for one user  to gift credit or value to another user  in the form of a gift certificate gift card or other form of value moreover in some cases the laundry service provides bonuses discounts or other types of rewards to users  who are repeat customers refer other customers or otherwise display loyalty for example a user  may be given a discount on every tenth use of the laundry service or may be given free dryer time free folding or other perksin some implementations the user  may still be enabled to use the laundry machine  even when the user device  the laundry machine  or both are offline without access to a network in such cases the user device  may store a secure token or other information previously received from the laundry service to indicate that the user  is authorized to use laundry machines  without a currently processed payment the token may itself indicate an amount of value or may indicate a promise of later payment by the user  for example the token may be encrypted and transferred to the user device  and subsequently transferred to the microcontroller  to cause the microcontroller  to enable use of the laundry machine  payment processing accounting operations or other actions may be performed later when the user device  or laundry machine  regains network access in this way implementations may enable customers to do laundry even during network outagesfig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for determining that a mobile device  is in proximity to a particular laundry machine  operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the customer application  other modules executing on the mobile device  or other modules executing on other deviceswhen the user  enters a laundromat  with their mobile device  a network interface of the mobile device  may detect  multiple beacon signals emitted from the various laundry machines  in the laundromat  the customer application  may analyze  the received signal levels eg signal strengths of the multiple beacon signals to identify the strongest beacon signal eg the beacon signal with the highest received signal levelthe customer application  may determine  whether the received signal level of the strongest beacon signal is at least a predetermined threshold level corresponding to a threshold distance if not the customer application  may continue monitoring  beacon signals to determine whether the mobile device  is subsequently bumped with a laundry machine  in some implementations the beacon signal eg the strongest beacon signal may be analyzed to measure its signal level as received at the mobile device  based on the signal level the distance between the mobile device  and the laundry machine  or the beacon  may be determined in some cases a relationship between signal level and distance may have been determined based on a prior calibration to measure distance versus signal level for various distances using a beacon signal having a particular transmitted power in some cases the relationship may be based at least partly on physical principles for example the signal level may be proportional to the inverse square of the distanceif it is determined  that the received signal level of the strongest beacon signal is at least the threshold level the customer application  may infer  or otherwise determine that the mobile device  is within the threshold distance of the laundry machine  that emitted the strongest beacon signal in response the customer application  may send  or cause to be sent the machine request to request the use of the laundry machine  as described with reference to figs a and bfig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for analyzing operational data collected from laundry machines  operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  or other modules executing on other devicesin some implementations the microcontroller  may be configured to collect operational data regarding the operations of the laundry machine  such operational data may be generated by the control modules  by the microcontroller  or by other components of the laundry machine  and collected by the microcontroller  the operational data may include but is not limited to one or more of the following data describing an amount of time when the laundry machine  has been operating or an amount of time when the laundry machine  has been idle data describing the number duration and type of cycles run on the laundry machine  data describing a weight or other measured amount of laundry processed by the laundry machine  data describing the temperature of the laundry machine  at one or more times or over a period of time data describing the current operational state data describing the past operational state of the laundry machine  at one or more times maintenance warnings or alerts or other data in some cases the microcontroller  may periodically run tests checks or other diagnostics on the laundry machine  to measure its operating condition the results of the diagnostics may also be included in the operational data the operational data may be periodically generated and collected or may be continuously generated and collected the microcontroller  may send the operational data via the network interfaces a to the management server devices in some implementations other types of operational data may be collected for example operational data may include information describing how long users  stay in the laundromat  how many users  are in the laundromat  how often and where the users  move within the laundromat  whether an attendant user  is in the laundromat  a number of attendant users  in the laundromat  how often and where the attendant users  move within the laundromat  or other information such operational data may be received from the user devices  of users  or attendant users  and may be stored as status information the management modules  may receive  the operational data sent from one or more laundry machines  or the user devices  in some implementations the management modules  may store  the operational data eg as status information  the operational data may be stored in persistent memory on the management server devices  or elsewhere in some cases the operational data may be received and processed in the active memory of the executing management modules the management modules  may analyze  the operational data to determine analysis output eg one or more metrics for one or more laundry machines  for example the operational data may be analyzed to determine laundry machines  that may require maintenance given the amount of time the laundry machines  have been operated since last maintenance in some cases the operational data may be analyzed to determine laundry machines  that have been operated long enough that they may be retired or replaced by new laundry machines  the analysis of operational data is described further with reference to figs in some implementations the operational data may be analyzed to determine which laundry machines  in a particular laundromat  have been overused or underused compared to other laundry machines  in the laundromat  such a determination may be employed to identify which laundry machines  to reserve for use and may enable the load balancing of the usage of multiple laundry machines  in a laundromat  for example in response to a reservation request the management modules  may reserve one or more laundry machines  that have been operated for less time than other laundry machines  in the laundromat the operational data may also be analyzed to generate other types of analysis output for example the operational data may be analyzed to identify patterns of use of different laundry machines  in a laundromat  and such an analysis may be employed to optimize the layout of the laundromat  or other laundromats and provide a more convenient user experience for customers operational data may be analyzed to determine whether a particular laundromat  is operating below capacity such that laundry machines  may be moved from the laundromat  to another laundromat  or such that it may be costeffective for the laundry service to close the laundromat  or reduce its operating hours operational data may also be analyzed to determine whether a particular laundromat  is in high demand by customers such that reservations are being denied to customers due to lack of available laundry machines  based on such an analysis result a determination may be made to add more laundry machines  to the laundromat  increase the available hours of the laundromat  or open additional laundromats  in the area to service the previously unsatisfied demand operational data may also be analyzed to determine for a laundromat  optimal hours during which the laundromat  may be open closed staffed by attendants unstaffed by attendants and so forthfig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for processing service requests for additional services to be performed with respect to laundry operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the customer application  other modules executing on the mobile device  eg a customer device an attendant application other modules executing on the mobile device  eg an attendant device the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  or other modules executing on other devicesthe management modules  may determine that a laundry cycle or other predetermined operational period of time has expired on a laundry machine  being used by a user  the management modules  may send  or cause to be sent a status information  indicating that the period of operation has finished on a particular laundry machine  the status notification  may be presented  through the ui of the customer application  executing on the users mobile device  desktop computer or other computing devicein some implementations as described with reference to fig  the customer application  may include one or more features that enable a user  to request additional services be performed with respect to the users laundry the customer application  may detect such a request and send  or cause to be sent service requests  to request additional services such as moving laundry from a washer to a dryer removing laundry from a dryer folding laundry adding more time to a laundry machine  and so forthon receiving the service requests  the management modules  may determine  whether an attendant currently present at the laundromat  in some cases a laundromat  may not be staffed with an attendant at all hours of the day if it is determined that no attendant is currently available at the laundromat  the user  eg the customer may be notified  for example the management modules  may respond to the service requests  with a message indicating to the customer that the additional services are not currently availableif an attendant is currently present at the laundromat  the management modules  may send  or cause to be sent one or more service instructions  to be presented on an attendant device operated by the attendant eg user  an attendant application executing on the attendant device eg mobile device  may present  the service instructions  to prompt the attendant to perform the additional services the management modules  may process  payment for the additional services in cases where payment is to be charged to the user  for the additional servicesfig  depicts an example process that may be executed in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure fig  describes an example process for dynamically determining pricing within the laundry service operations of the process may be performed by one or more of the management modules  other modules executing on the management server devices  or other modules executing on other devicesthe management modules  may collect  data regarding the operations of the laundry service such data may include but is not limited to current usage data  describing the current usage or nonusage of the laundry machines  managed by the laundry service reservation data  describing the current reservations of laundry machines  historical data  describing the past usage and reservations of laundry machines  or user population data  describing the number locations distribution density or other characteristics of the users  currently registered as customers of the laundry servicethe management modules  may analyze  the data collected at  and dynamically determine  pricing of laundry services based on the data analysis the laundry service may charge a price to the user  for the use of a washer dryer other laundry machines  or for the additional services described with reference to figs  and  in some implementations the pricing may be dynamically modifiable based on various considerations for example if particular laundromats  or the laundry service generally is exhibiting an increase in usage during a particular time of day day of the week day of the year and so forth the price of laundry services eg washing drying etc may be decreased or increased during such times moreover if a particular laundromat  is being underutilized the price of services at that laundromat  may be lowered to encourage more customers to try the laundry service in some cases if a particular laundromat  is experiencing high usage compared to other laundromats  in the area prices at the highusage laundromat  may be increased or prices at the lowerusage laundromats  may be decreased to encourage customers to use other laundromats  moreover prices at one or more laundromats  may be lowered as part of a sale promotion or other marketing strategy to encourage customers to use the laundry service in some cases lower prices may be charged at a new laundromat  during a period of time following the opening of the new laundromat  to introduce the laundry service to new customers in some cases the laundry service may monitor laundry machines  to detect instances in which laundry is left in a machine after a cycle or operation time period has completed and a user  may be charged for the time when the laundry is blocking others from using the machine such charges as well as any other charges for laundry services may be dynamically adjustedfigs  depict an example ui that may be employed to interact with a laundry service in accordance with implementations such as those of the present disclosure the

burk  elp thank you for introducing my company to the panstand from engineered laundry products elp we seldom see a new product that is well thought out well made and well represented for years i have been aggravated with drip pans that did not fit made the installation difficult or cracked because they were too large and either the installer or the client stepped on it the panstand solves all of these issues and more the panstand is a great resource for designing a laundry room that meets code and looks great the ability to stack the washer and dryer and then air sled it into position is amazing not only for saving the backs of the installer but keeping the clients walls from being marred and keeping brand new and expensive equipment from being scratched and dented when the maglite brand of flashlights was introduced they raised the bar for what a simple flashlight could be thank you elp for creating the maglite of laundry stands thank yourichard forbesabsolute kitchens  richard

centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do
