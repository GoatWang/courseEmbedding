of successful private equity credit and real estate investing  apollo is led by its managing partners leon black joshua harris and marc rowan apollo has offices in new york los angeles houston chicago st louis bethesda toronto london frankfurt madrid luxembourg mumbai delhi singapore hong kong and shanghai the private equity business is a key component of apollo’s investment activities we believe apollo has demonstrated the ability to quickly adapt to changing market environments and capitalize on market dislocations through its traditional and distressed investment approach  in prior periods of strained financial liquidity and economic recession apollo has made attractive private equity investments by buying the distressed debt of quality businesses converting that debt to equity creating value through active management and ultimately monetizing the investment apollo’s combination of traditional buyout investing with a “distressed option” has been successful throughout prior economic cycles and has allowed its funds to achieve attractive longterm rates of return in different economic and market environments apollo’s investment approach is valueoriented and often contrarian in nature  the firm focuses on nine core industries through which it has considerable knowledge while emphasizing downside protection and the preservation of capital  apollo has successfully applied this investment philosophy in flexible and creative ways over its year history allowing it to find attractive investment opportunities deploy capital across the balance sheet of industry leading or “franchise” businesses and create value throughout economic cycles apollo’s credit operations commenced in  as a complement to its private equity investment activity  apollo currently manages a number of credit funds including mezzanine funds senior credit funds distressed and hedge funds and nonperforming loan funds we may invest in or alongside of these credit vehicles which take advantage of the same disciplined valueoriented investment philosophy employed with respect to apollo’s private equity investment activities  apollo’s investment professionals frequently collaborate across disciplines including market insight management banking and consultant contacts as well as potential investment opportunities which apollo believes enables it to more successfully invest across a company’s

contrariansummaryipo of athene appears imminentathene should debut at a price of at least  a  premium to book value and to ap’s current share priceoperationally athene is very profitable with an roe of  it is also financially very strongthe value of athene and ap may have been reduced owing to new regulations likely to affect the sale of retirement productsa recap on apollo alternative assets otcpkaplvf the management of athene presented at aps fourth quarter  conference call on may th and gave a brief update on the year so far for those of you new to ap and wanting a thorough grounding in the company i published a previous article here please note it is exclusive for sa pro subscribers in brief ap is an investment vehicle launched by apollo the quoted private equity manager whose sole investment is in athene a private insurance company focused on retirement services and in particular fixed indexed annuities fias and reinsurance of guaranteed annuities in  athene was the th largest fia provider in the us and the nd largest provider of fixed indexed deferred annuities according to sales information from members of the life insurance and market research association limra the ipo is on track athene has registered with the sec to become a public company registration was initially scheduled for last fall but then changed to june  so they are a little ahead of the revised schedule i saw an ad on tv for athene over the weekend management did not give a date for the ipo but i assume it will be soon details of the number of shares being offered who is selling existing shares and the ipo price have yet to be announced apollo plans to retain its  stake in the company a preliminary prospectus is available here new fiduciary standards could impact the annuity business just when everything looked good for athene the dol introduced new regulations covering fiduciary standards that could reduce the sales of annuities heres what the  ey us lifeannuity insurance outlook said about the new rules the rule strengthens consumer protection constrains distributors and alters compensation for advisors providing retirement advice…the ability to recommend specific products may become more difficult creating a ripple effect on retirement sales and advice on the conference call management was clearly upset with the lack of consultation in drawing up the new rules but reiterated its commitment to the annuity business the laws are to be phased in over the next couple of years sales of fixed indexed annuities have increased steadily since  from b to b in  see chart below they have grown from accounting for  of total annuity sales in  to  in  according to limra an aging population and the absence of retirement savings coupled with the need for taxefficient savings products with guaranteed returns support the use of annuities my guess is that the industry will adapt and while sales will probably fall over the next couple of years annuities will continue to be in demand the environment is likely to lead to greater competition and some firms may decide to get out of the business completely this may not necessarily be bad news for athene which has grown through the acquisition of annuity businesses normally paying a steep discount to asset value in addition athene has launched new products which may help sales growth in assets past and future during  assets at athene grew from bn to bn as a result of the acquisition of delta lloyd bn and a capital raise of bn in fact acquisitions of other insurance companies or blocks of insurance have been the key growth driver for athene management remains on the lookout for such assets but i think these could be harder to source going forward the low hanging fruit has been captured nevertheless athene plans to be opportunistic in search of acquisitions athene has also sought to grow organically the companys sales of fixed annuities has raised deposits of bn bn and bn in   and  respectively most of these sales have come through the retail channel in which third parties are crucial to fuel sales growth athene plans to expand its distribution to more regional banks brokerdealers and independent marketing organizations over the coming years the recent acquisition of delta lloyds fixed annuity business in germany has opened a door into selling athenes products in europe another source of growth has been flow insurance which has growth by bn mm and mm over the last three years a third source of growth has been funding agreements where athene issued its first agreement of mm last year the company intends to increase the sales of such agreements finally the recent upgrade in its financial health to a should also help support future sales given athenes short life and the significant events that have occurred in that time it is difficult to base future growth in assets on past performance however if we assume that athene can raise mn in assets each year over the next five years and make a couple of acquisitions that total bn in assets and add growth through investment returns then it is conceivable that athene could have bn in investable assets in five years investment expertise to date athene has achieved a very attractive return on equity this is a result of two factors  astute sourcing of assets particularly acquiring assets below book value and reinvesting them at attractive rates and  investing in private equity investments that have delivered higher returns than more conservative investments would have delivered athene has access to apollos investment team and has employed it in managing private as well as public investments i think the investment team is top notch and it has been able to generate an attractive spread in its review of athene fitch noted that athene is led by a team with extensive industry experience in managing net investment spread businesses within life insurance companies while acquiring cheap assets management has also been able to retain discipline in the pricing of its products which has helped to control credit costs the investment margins achieved by the team for the past two years are shown in the table below investment margins q  q    fixed income  other investments     alternatives     net investment earned rate     cost of crediting on deferred annuities     investment margin on deferred annuities     source athene may  alternatives can account from  of the portfolio and currently is about  the fixed income portion of the portfolio also includes structured products such as nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities last year the portfolio held a higher weighting of cash partly due to calling in remaining funds from a capital raise which lowered returns athene believes that it can achieve an investment margin of  over the  weighted average life of the deferred annuities which account for most of its reserve liabilities of bn at a spread of  this would be equivalent to earning bn on its investment portfolio a look at the investment portfolio management focuses on taking liquidity risk and complexity risk and not just credit risk the portfolio maintains significant liquidity to take advantage of market dislocations approximately  of total invested assets are in floating rate securities management holds  in cash for growth opportunities to fund acquisitions the alternatives portion of the portfolio focuses on fixed incomelike cash flowbased investments the portfolio carries a higher risk than competitor portfolios but over time should produce higher returns all else being equal a somewhat aggressive investment portfolio source athene may   strong profitability management believes it can achieve an roe of  very few if any of its competitors achieve such a level during the past year the increase in shareholder equity and holdings of cash caused roe to fall to  whereas in  it hit  if we focus just on retirement services the company achieved an roe of  in  and  in  the big increase in the number of shares outstanding contributed to the fall in earnings per share operating income net of tax by segment q  q    retirement services mm mm mm mm corporate and other     operating income net of tax mm mm mm mm net income available to ahl shareholders mm mm mm mm operating roe ex aoci     operating roe ex aoci  retirement ser     roe excluding aoci     eps  diluted     book value ex aoci   weighted common shares outstanding  diluted mm mm mm mm as i noted above it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about future roe based on the most recent history acquisitions and related costs muddy the waters if we take  as an example results benefited from higher net investment income as management continued to invest the assets acquired from the aviva acquisition into higher yielding and higher quality investments the company also benefited from tax adjustments these gains were partially offset by an increase in amortization of commissions and costs dac dsi and voba involved in acquiring insurance corporate and other income was negative owing to lower alternative income from public equity positions and higher corporate expenses net income available to shareholders increased mainly due to a sharp reduction in nonoperating items eg the termination of an advisory contract with apollo lower stock compensation and income tax expense the table provides a reconciliation of nongaap and gaap earnings and illustrates some of the factors that have affected earnings as a reminder the capital raise contributed to lower eps thus what is normalized earnings is tough to gauge source athene preliminary prospectus  putting a value on ap alternative assets ive reproduced the table below from my last note with a few tweaks it illustrates potential outcomes depending on roe and pbv multiples in arguing for a premium to book value i would point to the following managements experience in the industry apollo plans to retain its  ownership in the company after the ipo good although short record of achieving attractive spreads on assets under management strong balance sheet and recent upgrade in the companys financial strength rating ability to grow the business organically and inorganically partially offsetting the positives above are the sector sells at somewhat depressed valuations uncertainty surrounding future sales of annuities peer group comparison the insurance sector is selling on depressed valuations at the moment and its difficult to find an exact match in terms of athenes business concentration on fixed annuities indeed other matters affect a stocks valuation but as you can see the two companies that earn an  roe sell above book value even if athene is priced at book value  i expect the stock price to appreciate quickly to reflect the higher roe the company can deliver incidentally the last private share offering was done at  a couple of years ago so i think  will be the minimum ipo price company roe pbv met life   genworth   prudential   lincoln   hartford   principal financial   reinsurance group   torchmark   source yahoo finance  may  in fact i think the shares will sell at a premium to book value given the higher roe athene delivers compared to competitors and i dont think apollo would be interested in selling at book value my best estimate is for the ipo to be priced near  with the potential for some appreciation when the shares start to trade im assuming no dilution over time if athene can achieve a  roe and sales of annuities are not adversely affected by the new regulations the shares could appreciate handsomely low estimate mid estimate high estimate current book value per share of athene    roe estimated    book value multiple nysex    ipo price of athene    current ap alternative price    potential return approx    the exit for ap shareholders ap alternative assets is committed to making an exchange offer to aps unit holders following the athene ipo ap unit holders would be entitled to receive the same number of shares in athene as ap holds in athene there is a  month lockup period after the ipo during which ap cannot sell its shares in athene following the lockup period ap will make a windup tender offer if less than  of unit holders elect to take the offer it will not be carried out in that case unit holders can elect to receive shares in athene on a pro rata basis ap could if it wanted sell its holding in athene and reinvest the proceeds in another investments however i think this is unlikely i assume that the value of aps shares would reflect the value of its holding in athenes publicly traded stock but with some discount of course investors could always sell their ap shares before the  months were up then again investors could just apply for shares in the ipo disclosure i amwe are long aplvf i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from
