pharmaceuticals inc pcrx and exact sciences corporation exas are shaking up the market  smarter analyst  login  connect premium services pacira pharmaceuticals inc pcrx and exact sciences corporation exas are shaking up the market julie lamb editorjuly    pm edt share on pacira’s exparel “hit where it needed to most” pacira pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqpcrx shares were falling  yesterday after the drug maker’s pain medicine failed to meet a primary efficacy endpoint in one of its two phase  femoral nerve block trial yet consider the grand scheme argues hc wainwright corey davis who believes this is one stumbling block in a multilayer race to the “finals” as far as davis sees it pacira is still “moving on to the finals” having just the right data to deliver a response to the fda’s complete response letter crl from back in march  in other words the drug maker will soon be refiling its snda in the indication of nerve block the miss of reduction in auc cumulative pain scores throughout  hours will not detract from pacira’s overall promising prospects in fact the analyst believes what counted more was the primary endpoint of reduction in auc cumulative pain scores over  hours as well as secondary endpoints of reduction in total postsurgical opioid consumption through  hours total number of opioidfree patients through  hours and reduction in time to first opioid rescue use through  hours here pacira came through and davis finds this will tackle every deficiency listed in the fda’s crl from two years prior besides “femoral nerve blocks are a quickly fading market anyway” comments davis with this in mind the analyst reiterates a buy rating on shares of pcrx with a  price target which represents a  increase from where the stock is currently trading to watch davis’ track record click here davis explains “as a result of the fda requests pacira had initiated two new nerve block studies  a replica of the original successful femoral nerve block study and  a ‘brachial plexus’ nerve block study the former is what missed its primary endpoint but this was due to a protocol violation at a single center when patients from this center were excluded the trial did indeed achieve statistical significance p specifically the violation was certain surgeons failing to inject patients into the posterior capsule not from failing to perform the actual nerve block properly we find it odd that this violation caused the study to fail since both active drug and placebo patients would have failed to receive the posterior injection the brachial plexus study was also announced this morning and was an overwhelming success therefore the company has everything it now needs to respond to the crl and we expect the refiling to occur later in q with an approval and launch in early ” tipranks analytics indicate pcrx as a strong buy out of  analysts polled by tipranks in the last  months  are bullish on pacira stock while  remain sidelined with a return potential of nearly  the stock’s consensus target price stands at  exact sciences hands in another “wow” quarter exact sciences corporation nasdaqexas shares are surging  today thanks to yesterday’s impressive quarterly print that not only outperformed expectations especially on strength of gross margin not only did the biotech firm raise expectations for its longterm goals on gross margins up to  but canaccord analyst mark massaro has every confidence exact can transcend even a margin of  in reaction the analyst reiterates a buy rating on exas while lifting the price target from  to  which represents a  increase from current levels to watch massaro’s track record click here “exas delivered another terrific quarter and is executing on all cylinders reporting a major beatandraise above the ‘blowout’ case we previewed given the major beat particularly on the gm line we are getting a much faster and clearer glimpse of the operating leverage this business has we are introducing our  eps of  share which assumes m in revenue gm of  and tests completed of m what’s more our model still does not include  an acceleration in doc ordering or doc utilization now that unh and aet are in contract  contribution from  new salespeople by q  cologuard reordering or  any additional test launches beyond cologuard” comments the analyst massaro surmises by pointing ahead to four key catalysts for exact investors to anticipate “ more commercial payor wins  additional data on liquid biopsies lung liver pancreatic etc  q results  partnership optionality we’re pleased to host exas at the canaccord genuity growth conference wed aug  in boston” for the second quarter exact delivered a  yearoveryear rise in revenues to  million which handily “toppled” the analyst’s projections calling for  million as well as the street’s of  million additionally the biotech firm yielded volumes of  that marked a strong  yearoveryear rise which “crushed” massaro’s forecast of  operating expenses of  million aligned with the analyst’s estimate me exact closed the quarter with  million in cash with its noninvasive colon cancer screening test cologuard covered by  million lives tipranks analytics

to nongaap  financial guidance for gross margins rd and sga about pacira pacira pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq pcrx is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial development of new products that meet the needs of acute care practitioners and their patients the company’s flagship product exparel® bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension indicated for singledose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia was commercially launched in the united states in april  exparel and two other products have successfully utilized depofoam® a unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates drugs without altering their molecular structure and releases them over a desired period of time additional information about pacira is available at wwwpaciracom  about exparel® exparel bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension is currently indicated for singledose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia the product combines bupivacaine with depofoam® a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a desired time period exparel represents the first and only multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the peri or postsurgical setting by utilizing the depofoam platform a single dose of exparel delivers bupivacaine over time providing significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a  percent decrease in opioid consumption the clinical benefit of the opioid reduction was not demonstrated additional information is available at wwwexparelcom  important safety information exparel is contraindicated in obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia exparel has not been studied for use in patients younger than  years of age nonbupivacainebased local anesthetics including lidocaine may cause an immediate release of bupivacaine from exparel if administered together locally the administration of exparel may follow the administration of lidocaine after a delay of  minutes or more other formulations of bupivacaine should not be administered within  hours following administration of exparel monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological status as well as vital signs should be performed during and after injection of exparel as with other local anesthetic products because amidetype local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver exparel should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease patients with severe hepatic disease because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations in clinical trials the most common adverse reactions incidence greaterthan or equal to  following exparel administration were nausea constipation and vomiting please see the full prescribing information for more details available at httpwwwexparelcompdfexparelprescribinginformationpdf  forward looking

a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines
