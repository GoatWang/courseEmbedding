be left to chance or some offtheshelf plan the approach we work through together should be as individual as you are when you partner with an edward jones financial advisor we follow an established process that starts with asking whats important to you and then we listen really listen after we understand whats important to you and why together we build a strategy tailored just for you based on your financial needs to work toward achieving your goals by working through the edward jones step asset management process with you your local financial advisor can help assess your tolerance for risk create a quantifiable actionable financial goal based on whats important to you recommend investments and strategies that support and align with your goals step  where am i today its difficult to plan for the future without an understanding of where you stand today this means identifying and prioritizing your needs assessing your tolerance for risk and understanding what impacts your current financial picture – things like income expenses and any savings talking about these factors helps shape the advice your financial advisor can offer and the strategy youll build together to get you where you want to go step  where would i like to be after determining where you are today the next step is identifying where youd like to be what does your vision for the future look like what are you trying to accomplish this discussion is very important your financial advisor will use this information and our tools to translate your vision into a personal measurable goal and to develop a written strategy to track your progress step  can i get there this is where the rubber meets the road you know where you stand what you want to do in the future and how much risk youre comfortable taking to get there your financial advisor can now help you answer the big question can i get there together youll analyze what youre currently doing and discuss any adjustments you can make to better position you to achieve your goals step  how do i get there discussing the first three steps allows your financial advisor to understand your complete financial picture – your needs attitude toward risk progress toward your goal and current investment strategy taking these factors into consideration along with our firms investment principles your financial advisor can identify the most appropriate investments protection and services to get you where you want to be its also important that you understand and are comfortable with the fees that come along with these investments and services thats why your financial advisor will walk you through the costs involved before you implement these recommendations step  how can i stay on track the last step may be one of the most important after building a solid strategy well work together to make sure you stay on track this is more than just what we do in the office – its about regularly checking in about questions you have or changes in your life or the market that may affect your current path putting your team in place we believe that when it comes to financial matters the value of professional advice cannot be overestimated
