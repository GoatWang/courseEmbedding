science speaks may   during a white house event in washington dc by james l doti  bgazzarscngcom  daily newsjuly   at  amat chapman university we have a bust of milton friedman that commemorates the establishment of an endowed chair in his honor when i contacted my former professor of money i ii and iii and asked him to select a quote of his to be engraved on the pedestal of his bust professor friedman gave me the following “a society that puts equality ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom… a society that puts freedom first will as a happy byproduct end up with both greater freedom and greater equality” when someone chooses a statement that will leave an enduring legacy surely it must embody the essence of that person’s philosophical beliefs i strongly believe that was the case in professor friedman’s personal selection of the above passage from “free to choose” the book he coauthored with his wife to memorialize the idea about which he was most passionate – the idea that freedom is the essence of life and our pursuit of happiness the power behind friedman’s championing of freedom was such that the world community took note in the early s milton and rose friedman’s “free to choose” became one of pbs’ most watched video series it attracted audiences abroad including communist countries where it was smuggled indeed many astute thinkers believe that the intellectual foundation behind the fall of the berlin wall finds its roots in “free to choose” in commenting on his global travels with his wife rose professor friedman identified a central theme of “free to choose” “wherever we found any large element of individual freedom some beauty in the ordinary life of man some measure of real progress in the material comforts at his disposal and a life filled with hope of further progress in the future – there we also found that the private market was the main device being used to organize economic activity” he commented on his birthday today i will do what i truly believe my teacher mentor and friend would have wanted more than anything else i will place a rose next to his bust not for him but in honor of the love of his wife rose a rose for a rose james l doti is president and donald bren distinguished chair of business and economics at chapman university in orange get the latest news delivered daily subscribe follow
