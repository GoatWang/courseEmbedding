lunchroom chains of the early th century we so strongly associate fast food chains with hamburgers that it may be surprising to learn that thompson’s popular sandwiches included cervelat smoked boiled tongue cold boiled ham hot frankfurter cold corned beef cold salmon and herkimer county cheese served on “milwaukee rye bread” baked by the chain’s bakery thompson was proud that his meals were suited for sedentary office workers of the s and s a  advertisement claimed that lunch at thompson’s “won’t leave you logy and lazy and dull this afternoon” thompson an illinois farm boy ran a rural general store as his first business he sold it in  moved to chicago and opened a restaurant on state street he proved to be a modernizer in the restaurant business as well as in politics he operated his restaurants on a “scientific” basis stressing cleanliness nutrition and quality while keeping prices low in  he moved the chain’s commissary into a premier new building on north clark street pictured today thompson’s then with  selfservice lunchrooms plus a chain of grocery stores became a public corporation in  after which it expanded outside chicago and into canada by  there were  restaurants  of which were in chicago and  in new york with a commissary in nyc by the mids thompson’s childs and waldorf lunch were the big three us chains small by comparison to mcdonald’s but significant nevertheless in politics thompson served as a republican committeeman and managed the campaign of a “good government” gubernatorial candidate in  a few years later he failed in his own bid to run for mayor promising he would bring efficiency to government while improving schools and roads in the s he financed a personal crusade against handguns despite john r thompson’s progressive politics his business would go down in history as one that refused to serve afroamericans or as civil rights leader marvin caplan put it in  “if the chain is remembered today it is not for its food but for its refusal to serve it” j r died in  where he stood on the question of public accommodations is unclear but the chain faced numerous lawsuits by blacks in the s however the best known case occurred in  when a group of integrationists led by mary church terrell was refused service in a washington dc thompson’s the group was looking for a case that would test the validity of the district’s thcentury public accommodations laws after three years in the courts the thompson case for which the washington restaurant association raised defense funds made its way to the supreme court which affirmed the socalled “lost” antidiscrimination laws of  and  as valid over the years the thompson chain absorbed others including henrici’s and raklios at some point possibly in the s the original thompson’s

the only open new england kitchen in chicago especial attention paid to ladies and children john r thompson jr prop open day and night…” reply victualling january   at  pm i find the reference to “new england kitchen” fascinating i wonder if it refers to the experimental “food station” of that name started by ellen richards “mother of home economics” chemist first woman to be admitted to mit in boston in  designed to provide affordable nutritious meals to the working poor i know john thompson was a reformer in the area of gun control who wanted to do away with all handguns it’s possible he

thompson i think in the ’s when cleaning up some print storage areas i found a lot of pictures dating back to their early opening if it was not for me they might have been lost forever in a move when bought out by green giant foods green giant bought them to help run some restaurants they had that were not as successful as thompsons you might try contacting green giant and requesting copies originally i turned them over to the advertising department but you may want to do more research these are fantastic historical pictures by the way by then they were hiring blacks so i guess when the

pm note that there was another restauranteur in chicago prior to my great grandfather john r thompson by the name of sh thompson the coin must be from his restaurant as jr thompson did not come to

this info thanks very much for posting it reply victualling february   at  pm i’ve heard this from quite a few people who had ancestors in the restaurant business i think it was a business that people did not have much respect for in the past but by today’s point of view your grandfather was a very successful business man reply peter pook january   at  am chris interesting point about respect for restaurants at the turn of the century restaurants were not under the more stringent health inspections they are today and people were naturally cautious about eating in them thompson’s was one of the first chains to adapt a white tile interior to show patrons they were clean food preparation was standardized i have several posters i found on the walls of the old commissary in chicago that admonished the food prep staff to always wash their hands cris january   at  am peter my grandfather always talked about the keeping the kitchen clean…he would go into every restaurant kitchen before we sat down in the restaurant to eat… and inspect them…he passed down all his rules to my parents in our home kitchen…i work for a gentleman now who owns a few restaurants and wanted all the office help to take a kitchen health test and with no studying i was the only one who passed with a  …i laughed and said my grandfather would be proud… cris april   at  am ruth i’m the granddaughter of br

appreciated ruth peter pook november   at  pm chris if you contact my niece deidre in this thread she has access to several bound volumes of the monthly thompson magazine for all thompson employees if

thomas hthomasgmailcom reply ruth january   at  pm it’s nice to meet you harry i think it’s a wonderful idea to collect thompson family history i’m not sure that i can point you to one source–most of our information has been gleaned from internet searches and of course there is the thompson building in downtown chicago unfortunately we don’t have much information on john r’s ancestors though i’d suggest searching on fithian il where he was born i’m afraid not too knowledgable about them good luck and if i find anything of interest i’ll let you know sincerely ruth owen daughter of david j owen

dr greding  years ago when i had my first root canalthis is my rd visit and let me tell you i am not a big fan of dentist since my last dentist accidentally sutured my check to my gum i have been scared to death of dentists in generalthe first time i found them they were willing to see me on the same day i was in excruciating pain and decided to finally give in and fix things upwhen i arrived i had a wonderful smiley faces of heather and macy greet and check me in she was so nice and welcoming minutes later i was called inthe dentist did a thorough exam and we found that all the pain was from a root canal that had not properly been done and had to be retreatedhe advised me to go to a specialist that he recommended and they booked me an apt for  min later i was seen cleaned up and the pain was gone  my old dentist didnt reach all the canals so it had gotten badly infected thankfully they fixed it allthen i went back for a crown and to fix other cavities i recommend dr greding to everyone  if you want a dentist that actually cares and doesnt only care about the money go see him his main priority was to get me out of pain and getting everything done well i completely trust himofficethe office is very clean modern and well decorated they also have every machine under the sun such as the cerac machine which make the crowns in minutes how cool is that witt my old dentist it took  days to make which meant more time off workcustomer serviceso far the service here has been top notchi am always greeted by name as i arrive with a smile and everyone seems genuinely happy to work herespeaking of great service i need to mention stacey wow she was so knowledgeable and made a simple affordable monthly payment plan for me so i could fix all my issues this year pricevery fair they are not overpriced and since i was in network my insurance went pretty farfinal verdicti love love love this place and highly recommend itcottle brad l ddstom w rateddr cottle is probably a very good dentist but knows very little about dentures i went to him with broken uppers who ever did the lab work was sloppy and left a lot of material on the crown leaving it very uncomfortable dr cottle just put them in without giving them a chance to settle he did no testing with carbon paper to check for bite and alignment by the time i got home my mouth was hurting like hell so i called for another appointment and one looked at by another dentist in that office she sent the dentures to the technician and when they came back i put them in and again there were no tests or checks made to see if they were fitted properly and they werent so l took out my trusty dremel and ground off the excess material to a point where they werent as painful the bite is still off enough to keep bitting the inside of my mouth my advice is to buy a dremel tool before getting any denture work heregentle dentalbecky p ratedi took my  yr old client to this place she needed  teeth pulled i asked the oral surgeon  dont you have to give antibiotics and wait before you pull a abbcessed tooth she said   no i will numb it good i went to the waiting room to wait and thats when i heard my clients screams when she came out she said  the dentist said that doesnt hurt wile she was pulling it she then pulled the second one after numbing it again right after that she walked out of the room this was so unacceptable with the pain meds we have today dont let her pull your tooth if you have infection no compassion from a dr that should have itthe employees were very nice and friendly as was the dental assistantdobson ranch family dentistrydaniel g rateda very professional yet causal office i was totally comfortable and didnt even need to take a xanax to keep me from having a panic attack which is the norm with all the other dentists i have gone to i did dentist shopping every six months when it came time for my biannual exam and cleaning i have finally found the dental practice i want to keep it took me two years but well worth it a totally professional visit soothing music and a staff that is friendly compassionate and work as a team that runs like a finetuned machine normally im anxious but found myself comfortable without the use of xanax within  minutes this team won me handover from the last there dentists i had beforehand kudosaxiom dentistrymysonispainlessnow ratedmy son is only  years old and always been very afraid of dentists he had lots of cavities and was in pain we decided to check out this office first thing i noticed was that the office was very clean and also kid friendly the doctor was also very good with my son my son didnt feel any pain when he gave a shot i have never seen my son so calm in dental chair before he explained the procedure very well so that someone nondental person like me can understand i think he said baby rootcanal and a filling on my son was done also prescribed some antibiotics for my son i really appreciate the discount as well since i didnt have any dental insurance yetaesthetic family dental caremartymanning ratedive had really great experiences here courtney the hygienist was terrific on my first visit and the office is really a friendly comfortable place then i had an old filling replaced  amazing i literally felt no pain at all  dr wallin was so careful with the needle that i actually did not feel it at all i had no residual pain that night and the surface match with my other teeth was perfect no need for touchup they also have a really cool panoramic digital xray that lets you see a  degree view of your skull bones teeth everything i would definitely recommmend them to my best friendvibrant dentistrymrscox ratedas someone with extreme anxietas someone with extreme anxiety over going to the dentist i would give dr metz and his staff an a they are always patient with me and very kind i have had first hand experience with everyone who works in this office and do not have a single bad thing to say with great bedside manner and professionalism dr metz and his staff have now worked on my teeth  times and i havent had a single issue dr metz displays great professionalism and lets you know exactly what he is doing every step of the way and does his best to make sure you are an informed consumer of his dental care spring family dentalgulzeblodhi ratedive been going to spring family dental for routine teeth cleanings for about a year now so far ive yet to have a cavity but in the event that i did dr spring is definitely the one i would turn to for help he and has staff have a gentleness of approach and disposition that i have found sorely lacking at other offices i rarely leave the office with sore or bleeding gums and appreciate that dr spring and his staff take such care when treating their patients if youve got children who need dental work i would enthusiastically recommend spring family dental for this reason axiom dentistrynomoretoothpain ratedi just had my molar root canal done in this office last week due to severe cavity i was in horrible pain for a few days until i couldnt take it anymore i really dont like going to a dental office but i am so glad i came here after i had the root canal done here by the doctor here i was in no pain also one of the staff members called me very next day to check up on me to see how i am doing i really appreciated that i only came here because this office was referred to me by a family friend who had some work done there before i will be coming here from now on red mountain dentalralph b ratedi have been going to see dr clifford since the year  he and his staff have been the most incredible people i could ever ask for in the field of dentistry i have never had anything close to an unpleasant or bad experience everyone from the office staff on have always treated me with dignity respect and professionalism the quality of care that i have gotten has been unsurpassed i have moved since i first started seeing him and i now have to drive almost  minutes and its worth it i highly recommend red mountain dentaldid you knowtypes of dentiststhe human mouth is a complex biological system and no two individuals have the same oral care needs here are some of the more common dentists people seek out to improve their oral healthgeneral dentist these dentists generally serve as the primary provider of dental care if you need your teeth cleaned crowns and bridges placed or any number of cosmetic procedures book an appointment with a general dentist though not as common these dentists will also provide more specialized services including some forms of oral surgery  chief among them root canals and restorative care  fitting patients with a mouthguard and counseling people on how to stop smoking and what constitutes proper nutritionendodontist to become an endodontist means undergoing an additional two years of training beyond dental school as a result these specialized dentists perform more specific procedures beyond general teeth cleaning and repair work while a dentist may perform a handful of root canal treatments in a week an endodontist may end up working on  or more in the same timespan your average endodontist also repairs teeth damaged by trauma and performs endodontic retreatments which is repeat root canal procedure their added training also means that the endodontist is much more adept at utilizing complex dental equipment  especially ultrasonic instruments or microscopes most of that equipment is used to improve the health of teeth that are affected by disease and even congenital deformitiespediatric dentist proper oral care starts when youre young and thats why pediatric dentists are so important these dentists treat people under the age of  though there are exceptions based on a childs unique dental background pediatric dentists face unique challenges because they must treat newly teething babies and children losing their primary teeththough cleanings are an integral part of their job pediatric dentists are mostly concerned with planning ahead that means working to ensure the child has straight teeth and correcting an improper bite however they also help address more childspecific conditions of thumb sucking and an overreliance on pacifiers as a result pediatric dentists usually require an additional twoyear residency working with infants and childrenoral pathologist pathology refers to the study of disease specifically as it presents in tissue oral pathologists then are responsible for studying the diseases that affect the tissue of the mouth and other surrounding muscle groups these experts are considered to be true specialists having focused their work on very niche areas of both dentistry and pathology though oral pathology is rather specialized its a vital component of the oral health industry by analyzing tissue taken from biopsies oral pathologists can help diagnose and eventually treat a number of oral diseases including leukoplakia cementoma and squamous cell carcinoma among othersperiodontist similar to the endodontist periodontists receive several additional years of training beyond dental school however whereas endodontists study advanced treatments periodontists generally have a very specific field of interest your average periodontist focuses less on cleanings and more on diagnosing and treating gingivitis periodontitis which is an untreated form of the aforementioned ailment and other periodontal diseases periodontists treat patients with more complicated oral care backgrounds those people who require root planing  where dentists clean any infected surfaces  and root debridement or the removal of dead tissue periodontists are especially concerned with proper gum health including painful recession and teeth alignmentcosmetic dentist most of the aforementioned dentists are concerned with the health and wellbeing of a patients teeth while that is important to cosmetic dentists they specialize in a number of different treatments meant to enhance the look or aesthetic of your teeth to begin the average appointment cosmetic dentists will examine your teeth for any imperfections or irregularities and then suggest ways to make your teeth more white or properly aligned the most popular such treatments are bleaching  where special chemicals are used to whiten your teeth  placing veneers or caps to alter the appearance of teeth and bonding where dentists fill unappealing gaps with structural replacement materialorthodontist orthodontists are responsible for treating most dental irregularities which includes everything from misaligned jaws  like an under or overbite  to overcrowding teeth and even certain cosmetic issues following dental school the wouldbe orthodontist then has another three years of schooling most of which is clinical experience in an orthodontic residency program to properly diagnose and treat most dentofacial issues the orthodontist relies on a collection of

specialty however there are a core group of ailments all dentists treat conditions includetooth decay when your teeth fall out or begin to disintegrate in your mouth improper brushing is often to blame certain infections also cause tooth loss or decay one of the most affective ways to prevent tooth decay is with regular brushing and flossing right at homebad breath as your teeth fall out or you dont brush properly your gums and teeth begin to break down and cause foul odors other causes of bad breath include gum disease and oral infections as with tooth decay brushing and flossing are vital as is regular tongue scraping and the use of mouthwashteeth sensitivity some people are born with teeth that are naturally sensitive to cold a lack of brushing can also comprise your teeths natural protection the best method to help protect otherwise sensitive teeth is to use specialized toothpaste geared toward people with worn or damaged teethdry mouth certain medications will cause your salivary glands to stop producing spit this in turn can harm the structure of your teeth and gums there are several athome measures you can take to combat dry mouth these include regular hydration chewing sugarfree gum which also hydrates your mouth and avoiding mouthwash with alcohol in it which dries out your entire mouthteeth grinding for many people grinding their teeth  also known as bruxism  is a subconscious behavior usually the result of stress it can eventually damage your teeth the only way to treat your grinding habit is to meet with an endodontist who will fit you with with a bite plate to mitigate the damage to your teethmouth sores also called canker sores these painful bumps are the result of irritation to the soft tissue of your mouth these sores can make brushing almost impossible there are a number of different causes for sores including anemia or a vitamin b deficiency as a result your primary physician will have to examine the bump find its root cause and then help develop a specific treatment plan including the use of corticosteroids to reduce inflammation or antimicrobial mouthwashdiscoloration yellow teeth are the result of a number of bad habits mainly smoking drinking too much coffee and improper nutrition proper brushing can usually prevent discolored teeth before they happen however if your teeth become worse many dentists will treat with a whitening procedurea guide for dental care basicsproper oral care begins at home the following are a few preventative measures you can take to keep your teeth and gums healthy they just may reduce your time spent in your dentists chairremember your angles when brushing your teeth always place the brush at a degree angle that way youre able to hit every surface of each toothdont forget the tongue within your mouth your tongue is the largest source of bacteria be sure to brush it front to back and dont forget the sidesfloss everyday brushing alone isnt enough to keep your mouth healthy and thats why flossing is so important each time you floss be sure to have at least  inches of floss available which is what you should go through if you use proper technique for optimal control hold the floss between your thumbs and forefingerswatch what you eat sugar alcohol and coffee all contain phosphorus while some can prove beneficial too much of this chemical can eat away at your teeth and gumskeep in mind the mouthwash though not a requirement mouthwash can be helpful if used to supplement proper brushing and flossing most mouthwash brands contain chlorine dioxide a chemical that targets the majority of oral bacterial strains however dont overuse mouthwash as it can cause a number of ailmentshow to choose the right dentistproper oral care is an integral component of your greater wellbeing which highlights why having the right dentist is of the utmost importance consider the following as you make an effort to find a dentist who will fit your unique medical historyfind a recommendation its important to use a dentist whom you feel comfortable with because thats difficult to achieve by simply choosing names out of a phone book you should always seek out a recommendation whether its a friend family member or coworker this individual can offer intimate details about a dentists demeanor operating style and approach to patient care be sure to always ask plenty of questionsvet your dentist once you get a recommendation from a friend dont simply book your first cleaning right away instead meet with any prospective dentists to conduct a series of pretreatment interview during this session you can ask them about what treatments they perform most often procedures theyre not as familiar with what accreditation they have or any organizations they belong to and how their offices handles insurance and payments just be aware that booking this time can be difficult based on a dentists scheduleconsider accessibility and other factors perhaps youve met a dentist with whom you feel comfortable not only that but this dentists payment options are suitable for your finances however dont be so quick to make a final decision as other factors may influence your choice is the dentists office nearby or do you have to drive out of your way is the office open at a time that will fit the rest of your schedule how much flexibility will the dentists staff offer in booking appointments though seemingly trivial these factors are nonetheless importantcheck with your state board one of the last things you should do before coming to a decision is to check with your states dental board dentists must abide by different rules and regulations depending on where they practice and the state board can outline what requirements your candidate must meet these organizations can also offer information about any discrepancies in the dentists background and if he or she has faced any disciplinary actionspicking the right dental insuranceas with other forms of health care insurance is a great way to both reduce associated costs and ensure you and your dependents receive the best care possible however you dont want to simply buy the first such plan you see here are some factors to consider when shopping for dental insurancepick your plan there is no such thing as a onesizefitsall dental insurance plan instead most people purchase three main varieties usually through their employers an indemnity or feeforservice plan is just as it sounds and means youll have to pay for annual deductibles and coinsurance payments out of pocket a preferred provider organization is less costly and you choose from a network of dentists however ppos have some limitations and accompanying deductibles similarly a dental health maintenance organization plan limits you to just a few choices of dentists and one doctor handles all of your oral care needs however these hmo are usually much less costlyexamine the networks as noted ppo plans and dental hmos work with only a select number of doctors while that usually means fewer costs compared to other insurance plans or payment options it also means you dont have quite as much say in the dentist who can treat you that doesnt necessarily have to be a bad thing especially if you know who is in the network before purchasing the plan youll receive a list of dentists in each network do research on each doctor  just as you would when picking a dentist otherwise from there you can then pick a plan with doctors who meet your standards and requirementsconsider your coverage sometimes its not just the doctor that you want to consider for many people even the plans with the best doctors are deemed a bad choice the reason the coverage is lessthanstellar when picking a plan you need to look at just how much youll pay for each and every service for instance some plans wont cover your fillings or xrays while others may charge more or less for a crown or tooth extraction knowing just what youll be responsible for is important as you dont want to be caught offguard by unforeseen charges depending on your employer a human resources specialist can walk you through specific coverage optionsmake your plan work for you its a sad fact that the dentist you want most might not be covered by the plan youve purchased however that doesnt mean that you have to look for dental services elsewhere if youre truly comfortable with a dentist and you feel he or she can be an ally in your ongoing oral care regimen then consider signing a plan to just keep that dentist available that means potentially deal with costs and other insurancerelated factors that you might have wanted to if need be you might be able to work with the dentists office to address some of the planspecific concerns we just
