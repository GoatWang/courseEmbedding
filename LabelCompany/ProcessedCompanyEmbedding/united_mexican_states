most amazing” was a costco “it was as big clean and modern as any in america” recalled gov john hickenlooper d who found the aisles filled with shoppers bearing “nothing but positive feelings toward the united states” especially toward us stuff the costco was stocked with products stamped “made in usa” including some of the  million in goods that colorado exports to mexico each year marbled slabs of steak from greeley cans of pinto beans from holyoke and sacks of russet potatoes out of monte vista trade between the united states and mexico is surging up  percent in  to a record  billion as mexico vies with china to become america’s secondlargest trading partner after canada china and the united states did  billion in trade last year the growing middle class that is fast becoming mexico’s majority is buying more us goods than ever while turning mexico into a more democratic dynamic and prosperous american ally “we are obsessed with china when we ought to seriously focus for our own benefit on our neighbor mexico” said robert pastor a professor of international relations at american university and author of “the north american idea” while news about headless torsos drug barons and illegal immigration dominates the headlines and much of the obama administration agenda south of the border has focused on law enforcement economists say another story is one of roaring trade “not only is mexico doing better macroeconomically speaking than the false stereotypes would have us think mexico is actually doing better than the united states” said richard fisher president of the federal reserve bank of dallas who applauds mexico for controlling inflation balancing budgets and managing debt fisher grew up in mexico city in the s and remembers a mexico that “was our soft underbelly a country of tremendous poverty and horribly bad governments” now fisher and his peers praise mexico for pouring billions of pesos into infrastructure including ports railroads refineries and highways in the same breath investors worry about everything mexico still needs to do enforce the rule of law reduce poverty bust wasteful telephone and media monopolies open the national oil industry to foreign investment and curb endemic corruption the kind that exposed walmart to allegations the company paid  million in bribes to speed permits for construction in the world bank’s  annual report “doing business” which measures benchmarks such as enforcing contracts paying taxes and protecting investors mexico finished a middling rd among  countries an embarrassing rating for the probusiness government of outgoing president felipe calderon but the trend lines are up “the better off mexico is the better off we are” fisher said “and all these walmarts sam’s clubs and costcos are for the emerging middle class” ‘deeply integrated’ trade with the united states has increased sixfold since the north american free trade agreement went into effect in  according to bank of mexico and us commerce department data the trade agreement eliminated tariffs for goods and made it easier to invest across the border in the united states nafta is still often used as a pejorative shorthand for outsourced jobs particularly in rust belt states where manufacturers have closed plants and moved south the torrid expansion of auto manufacturing in mexico for instance is viewed by some industry experts as a longterm threat to muchtouted us job growth in the sector but nafta today generates far less controversy in mexico the last large protests by farmers angry about cheap corn imports from canada and the united states occurred in  during mexico’s presidential campaign this year none of the candidates — not even leftist challenger andres manuel lopez obrador — campaigned against nafta or threatened to revoke it the winner presidentelect enrique peña nieto said he wants to expand it and there is little wonder why mexican exports to the united states have soared from  billion in  to  billion in  according to the commerce department almost  percent of mexico’s exports go to the us market led by crude oil fruits vegetables televisions cellphones computers and passenger vehicles “before nafta we had a slight trade deficit with the united states” said daniel chiquiar a bank of mexico statistician “now we have a huge trade surplus” us exports have also multiplied especially as the consumption tastes of the growing mexican middle class increasingly resemble those of us shoppers “mexico and the united states are no longer competitors where one country wins and the other loses they are partners” said christopher wilson of the mexico institute in washington who is the author of the report “working together” “the mexican and us economies are now as deeply integrated as any on earth” ‘looking for quality’ in a costco store in the suburbs at the edge of mexico city shoppers browse shelves loaded with pallets of kirkland vitamins value packs of nature valley granola bars and sacks of cape cod kettlecooked potato chips from  to   new discounters and more than  convenience stores opened for business in mexico the biggest growth came in modern retail chains filled with us products that are challenging for better or worse the traditional momandpop stores doling out soda eggs and tortillas mexico bought  billion worth of us goods last year up from  billion in  the united states sold more stuff to mexico than to brazil india japan and britain combined at costco even the walls in the butcher aisle boast the “usda premium” and “usda choice” labels in english sales were up  percent last year at the company’s  stores in mexico according to iñigo astier the executive in charge of purchasing for costco’s mexico operations “costco members here in mexico are middle class even upper middle class” he said “as our economy grows consumers are looking for quality products and costco is consistent in quality” about  million jobs in the united states depend on trade with mexico according to the consulting group trade partnership worldwide which calculated the total for the mexican government in  more than  percent of the chickens texas ships beyond its borders go to mexico new jersey sends  billion in pharmaceuticals iowa exports  million in pork montana  million in copper and molybdenum preferring usmade goods in mexico’s costco stores staples such as tortilla chips and chipotle salsa are trucked in from factories in california and texas that produce for both sides of the border with  million people of mexican descent living in the united states and extensive travel — and shopping — up north mexico’s middle class has come to equate americanmade products with higher quality even if the products costly slightly more “the mexican consumer is less focused on price and more focused on freshness” said sonia denham a senior sales manager for california organic produce giant earthbound farms which supplies costco stores in mexico and the united states “a salad produced or labeled in the us is a more prestigious item” said denham who explained that the “usda organic” label is sought out by the discerning mexican saladeater jim walstrom chief executive of motely minnbased morey’s seafood international said his company’s relationship with costco has opened doors to a vast market of  million mexicans who will increasingly serve items such as pacific salmon and mahimahi to their families “what we sell down there rivals what we can sell in any given store in the us” walstrom said working together many us goods — metalworking machines agricultural processors car parts — are destined for the factory floors of mexico as the country grows as a manufacturing hub helped by nafta and lower transportation costs and wages trade analysts have watched mexico move from farm work to assembly plants to the highskill manufacturing necessary to make airplanes and satellites earlier this year china lost its factorywage advantage over mexico rising chinese labor costs are pushing companies to “reshore” production back to mexico and the united states where transportation costs are lower too this year mexico became the no  investment destination for the aerospace industry more and more mexican and us companies work together researchers say that an imported product from mexico sold in the united states actually is  percent “made in usa” because of the sharing of parts and labor between neighbors that same import from china to the united states is only  percent “made in usa” us companies have been steadily increasing their investments in mexico and have poured  billion into  companies since  their mexican counterparts have not been idle products selling under the brands sara lee thomas’ english muffins borden milk

story of exploitation and extreme hardship lea esta historia en español » the times found many farm laborers are essentially trapped for months at a time in ratinfested camps often without beds and sometimes without functioning toilets or a reliable water supply some camp bosses illegally withhold wages to prevent workers from leaving during peak harvest periods laborers often go deep in debt paying inflated prices for necessities at company stores some are reduced to scavenging for food when their credit is cut off its common for laborers to head home penniless at the end of a harvest those who seek to escape their debts and miserable living conditions have to contend with guards barbedwire fences and sometimes threats of violence from camp supervisors major us companies have done little to enforce social responsibility guidelines that call for basic worker protections such as clean housing and fair pay practices the farm laborers are mostly indigenous people from mexicos poorest regions bused hundreds of miles to vast agricultural complexes they work six days a week for the equivalent of  to  a day the squalid camps where they live sometimes sleeping on scraps of cardboard on concrete floors are operated by the same agribusinesses that employ advanced growing techniques and sanitary measures in their fields and greenhouses the contrast between the treatment of

fields when times journalists visited the camp in march juan ramirez a yearold with a toddler back home in veracruz had been working at san emilio for six weeks and had yet to be paid he and other

been promised  in pocket money every two weeks but received it only sporadically if they left now they would forfeit the wages theyd earned the barbedwire fence that ringed the camp was an added deterrent farm owners say the barriers are meant to keep out thieves and drug dealers they also serve another purpose to discourage laborers from leaving before the crop has been picked and theyve paid their debts to the company store even if the workers at san emilio jumped the fence as some had they wouldnt be able to afford a ride to culiacan let alone  for the bus ticket home juan hernandez

laborers said he was promised that he would be able to send money home his family was still waiting because he hadnt been paid my family isnt the only one that suffers anyone who has a family at home suffers he said efrain hernandez  said recruiters told him his earnings would be held back so he wouldnt get robbed they said it was for my own good outside one of the buildings a group of men gathered under a dim light it was nearing the  pm curfew when the camps heavy metal gate rolls shut and workers retreat to their rooms their voices echoed across the compound as they swapped stories about conditions in various camps there are at least  across mexico  in sinaloa alone pedro hernandez  complained that unlike some other camps san emilio didnt offer beds or blankets then again there were fewer rats he said the conversation attracted a camp supervisor who was surprised to see a reporter and photographer when the people from walmart come she said they let us know in advance she walked the journalists to the exit the pickers went back to their rooms the gate rolled shut the road to labor camps like san emilio begins deep in the indigenous regions of central and southern mexico where advertising jingles play endlessly on the radio echoing from storefront speakers attention attention we are looking for  peasants to pick tomatoes youll earn  pesos per day three free meals per day and overtime vamonos a trabajar — lets go work on a warm january morning this year dozens of indigenous people looking for work descended from mudhut villages in the steep mountains of the huasteca region nahuatl men wore holstered machetes women cradled children in their arms young men shouldered backpacks stuffed with the clothes they would wear for the next few months the laborers approached a knot of recruiters gathered outside a gas station in the town of huejutla de reyes about  miles north of mexico city long march for meager pay peasants from mexicos indigenous regions are bused to export farms in the west and northwest to pick and process fruits and vegetables the huasteca region is a prime source of agricultural labor among those offering jobs at distant farms was luis garcia  garcia a stocky nahuatl indian with silverrimmed teeth had risen from child picker to field boss to labor contractor for agricola san emilio he lived just outside town in a hilltop house behind tall gates and was known to locals as don luis we all owe our livelihoods to the farmworkers he said we have to treat them well or the gringos dont get their tomatoes labor contractors are key players in the agricultural economy the link between export farms in the north and peasants in huasteca and other impoverished regions an estimated  make the pilgrimage every harvest season the contractors working for agribusinesses transport laborers to and from the farms often they also oversee the camps and distribute workers pay many contractors abuse their power according to indigenous leaders and federal inspectors they lie about wages and living conditions at the camps under pressure from growers they sometimes refuse to bring laborers home even at the end of their contracts if there are still vegetables to be picked earlier this year  farmworkers walked  miles across a baja california desert after a contractor left them on the roadside short of their destination at the gas station in huejutla de reyes villagers listened warily to the recruiters pitches one was said to be representing a contractor wanted on human trafficking charges another worked for a contractor notorious for wage theft and other abuses garcia had his own brush with controversy several years ago when dozens of pickers accused him of holding them captive and abusing them at an onion farm in chihuahua they said i beat people lies all lies garcia said bristling i wouldnt be here today talking to you if it was true would i he depicted himself as a reformer who wanted to establish a trade association to set standards and drive out unscrupulous contractors “ the gringos are the ones that put up the money and make the rules ” — luis garcia labor contractor share this quote but he saw no need to do more for workers the more protected they are the less they work he said as he spoke recruiters tried to outbid one another for laborers boosting their offers of spending money for the twoday bus trip to sinaloa garcia won the days competition with his smooth baritone he persuaded about  people to get on his bus garcia read their contract aloud to the workers including the provision that they wouldnt be paid until the end of their threemonth term he later acknowledged that federal law requires weekly payments but said that there were other issues to consider paying them every week is a problem because it causes lots of issues with drinking and drugging and violence garcia said huasteca people are fighters when theyre drunk proud of his success in a cutthroat business garcia portrayed himself as the product of a farm labor system in which the real bosses were us companies the gringos are the ones that put up the money and make the rules he said jenobeba diaz matia bathes her monthold son in a basin where fellow residents wash dishes and clothes at their governmentrun camp in isla del bosque sinaloa the us companies linked to agricola san emilio through distributors have plenty of rules but they serve mainly to protect american consumers not mexican field hands strict us laws govern the safety and cleanliness of imported fruits and vegetables to meet those standards retailers and distributors send inspectors to mexico to examine fields greenhouses and packing plants the companies say they are also committed to workers wellbeing and cite their ethical sourcing guidelines retailers increasingly promote the idea that the food they sell not only is tasty and healthful but was produced without exploiting workers but at many big corporations enforcement of those standards is weak to nonexistent and often relies on mexican growers to monitor themselves the times found in some lowwage countries us retailers rely on independent auditors to verify that suppliers in apparel footwear and other industries comply with social responsibility guidelines for the most part that has not happened with mexican farm labor american companies have not made oversight a priority because they havent been pressured to do so there is little public awareness of harsh conditions at labor camps many farms are in areas torn by drug violence which has discouraged media coverage and visits by human rights groups and academic researchers asked to comment on conditions at agricola san emilio subway said in a statement we will use this opportunity to reinforce our code of conduct with our suppliers the code says suppliers must ensure that workers are fairly compensated and are not exploited in any way industry talking points growers distributors and importers of mexican farm produce got sample talking points from an industry trade group that learned the times was preparing this series read the memo » safeway said we take any and all claims regarding worker conditions seriously and are looking into each of the points you raise in its vendor code of conduct safeway says that suppliers must offer a safe and healthy work environment and that it will not tolerate any departure from its standards vendors are expected to selfmonitor their compliance the code says walmart sought to distance itself from agricola san emilio saying in a statement our records show that we do not currently take from this facility asked if it had received produce from the farm in the past walmart repeated its statement executives at agricola san emilio and two firms that have distributed its produce — triple h of culiacan and andrew  williamson of san diego — said walmart received shipments from the mexican farm this year john farrington chief operating officer at andrew  williamson said that his company shipped san emilio tomatoes to the retailer and that inspectors from walmart had been to the farm mari cabanillas an assistant camp supervisor at agricola san emilio said walmart inspectors visited regularly recommending cleanups and fresh coats of paint they try and improve conditions here she said theyre very strict as for agricola san emilios pay practices daniel beltran the firms director and legal counsel said workers from the huasteca region whose wages were withheld until the end of their threemonth contracts had agreed to that arrangement he said they could opt to be paid weekly as others were a dozen workers however said in interviews that they had no choice in how they were paid withholding workers pay is illegal even if they agree to it according to mexicos federal labor law a senior federal labor official and two labor lawyers in regard to living conditions beltran said the company stopped providing beds because workers dismantled them for firewood the laborers are from regions where its common for people to sleep on the floor he said enforcement of mexican labor laws in sinaloa is feeble one state official insisted incorrectly that withholding wages until the end of a contract was legal he took issue with workers claims that they were underfed some people even if you give them chicken or beef every day theyll still want a different menu he said adding that workers could supplement company rations by purchasing food from vendors sunfed an arizona firm that has distributed produce from agricola san emilio said its representatives had inspected the fields and packinghouse at the farm but not the labor camp the mexican government would be the first line of protection for mexican workers said dan mandel president of sunfed a distributor for supermarkets across the us enforcement of mexican labor laws in sinaloa is feeble one state official insisted incorrectly that withholding wages until the end of a contract was legal federal labor inspectors are clear on the law but said they were largely powerless to crack down on deeppocketed growers who can stymie enforcement with endless appeals they just laugh at us said armando guzman a senior official with mexicos federal secretariat of labor and social welfare they mock authority and mock the letter of the law agricola san emilio is no outlier harsh conditions persist in many camps at agricola rita rosario a cucumber exporter near culiacan in sinaloa workers said they hadnt been paid in weeks some were pawning their belongings to pay for diapers and food when times journalists visited a year ago laborers said company managers had threatened to dump their possessions in the street if they persisted in demanding their wages we have nowhere to go were trapped said a yearold man looking around nervously rita rosario under new management started paying workers their back wages this year before suspending operations according to a us distributor who did business with the farm workers at agricola santa teresa an export farm nearby were doing odd jobs outside the camp on sundays to earn spending money because their wages had been withheld the tomato grower supplies us distributors whose customers include the albertsons supermarket chain and the los angeles unified school district told that workers hadnt been paid enrique lopez director of santa teresa said it wasnt the companys fault santa teresa pays them by electronic bank deposit every week he said lopez said he suspected that the laborers handed over their atm cards to the contractor who recruited them a practice he said was customary for workers from indigenous regions that is the agreement they have lopez said we cant control that situation an lausd spokeswoman ellen morgan said the district requires suppliers to inspect farms from which they buy produce primarily to ensure food safety she said the district was formulating a new procurement policy that would probably address labor conditions too albertsons declined to comment luis perez  washes clothes after bathing in an irrigation canal outside campo san jose he and

feldman said in a letter that the womens showers and toilets were fully functioning with a paid attendant asked why workers were washing in the irrigation canal feldman wrote ciruli cannot explain this with certainty but it was told that it may be a cultural practice among some workers he added ciruli will consult with the onfarm social worker and doctor to determine if a worker education
