time to consider activelymanaged funds thrivent mutual fundsvoice a more human approach to investing by gene walden senior finance editor and jeffrey branstad cfa senior investment product strategist thrivent mutual funds no question index funds have enjoyed strong performance the past seven years during the second longest bull market run in us history but if the market should stumble under the weight of the recent tepid economic conditions and the prospect of rising interest rates a new thrivent mutual funds active vs passive study suggests that investors in index funds may be well served to consider switching their dollars to activelymanaged funds the study shows that during the two market crashes of the st century the sp  significantly trailed activelymanaged large cap noload funds  in fact as the following graphs demonstrate the index wouldn’t even have ranked in the top  in terms of performance during a single month stretch of the dotcom crash of  –  and would have trailed its peer group during  of the global financial crisis of  –  in fact as the next graph shows the index trailed the universe of activelymanaged large cap noload  funds the majority of the time over the entire course of the volatile decade of  through  the sp  is not the only index to experience subpar performance relative to activelymanaged funds during bear markets and extended periods the study also focused on the russell  index  of small stocks while the russell  has done well versus the activelymanaged fund universe during most of the recent bull market it would have ranked in the bottom th quartile of the small cap category during  of the  rolling month periods of the dotcom crash in fact the index would have ranked in the bottom half of corresponding activelymanaged noload funds the majority of the time over the past  years dating back to  as the following chart shows why now if you’re concerned that the long bull market run is winding down or that the recent rise in interest rates will continue or if you’re apprehensive about the uncertainty of a new administration this may be the time to consider switching from index funds to activelymanaged funds while past performance is no guarantee of future results as the thrivent mutual funds active vs passive study demonstrated the noload activelymanaged funds in the study have done a better job of limiting losses than their corresponding indexes during the recent bear markets and volatile market stretches to achieve even greater diversification investors may consider activelymanaged asset allocation funds which offer broad diversification across multiple asset classes  while diversification does not eliminate risk it generally helps reduce losses during steep stock market declines here are several other reasons to consider switching to activelymanaged funds flexibility some managed funds have done better than index funds during down markets due in part we believe to the fact that fund managers have had the ability to make some adjustments in their portfolios to reduce the stocks or sectors that appear the most problematic investment managers can also use risk management techniques and diversification that seek to provide similar returns to the market with lower risk and volatility help when needed most a rising tide lifts all boats ever since the federal reserve launched quantitative easing activities intended to stabilize the economy and lower interest rates all of that extra capital in the system has flowed to equities across the board boosting market returns while greatly increasing correlations among stocks that means that all equities even stocks that many active managers think are unattractive have generally gone up together with higher risk companies that carry more debt on their books actually leading the way as the low interest rates have distorted the risks inherent in holding too much debt that’s been an advantage for index funds since they own all equities even those presumably “higher risk” stocks that active managers are avoiding but while an index fund may or may not offer better returns in a bull market active managers tend to provide their greatest value during bear markets when investors need their help the most normally and particularly so in bear markets stocks experience a wide variety of rates of return meaning that index funds will be exposed to both the good performers and the bad while active managers have a better opportunity to avoid those bad performers a better chance to beat the market the fact is index funds perpetually trail the market by a small margin their costs while minimal create a small differential between the market performance and their own returns as the study demonstrates in any given year activelymanaged funds can and have outperformed the market active funds have responded by lowering fees activelymanaged mutual funds have responded to the low fees of index funds by lowering their own fees over the past  years according to the investment company institute the average equity mutual fund expense ratio was  in  and dropped to just  in  the lower fees would add on average about  per year to the returns of activelymanaged funds all other expenses remaining the same in general lowering fees results in an increase to the total returns of equity mutual funds limiting market losses can speed up your recovery actively managed funds may not always cut your losses but if you are successful in reducing your losses in a down market through an activelymanaged fund the road to recovery becomes much easier in fact the bigger the loss the more difficult it becomes to recover from that loss for instance for a  loss you would need a gain of  to restore your portfolio to its previous level but with a  loss you would need a gain of  to get back to even a  loss would require a gain of  to fully recover and a  loss would require a  gain to bring the portfolio back to its previous level in terms of pure longterm performance index funds may or may not have a slight edge but when the chips are down and the markets are reeling the thrivent mutual funds study suggests that you may

comparative performance it measures the average percentile of how they ranked over the given period of time as with the quartile rankings a lower percentage indicates better performance while a higher percentage indicates worse performance for example in the dotcom crash table below the average percentage of the sp  was  which put it in the bottom  among all funds in that category  the russell  index fared even worse with an  average percentage – which means it would have ranked in the bottom  of funds in the small cap category in the following charts please keep in mind that the st quartile represents the best performance and the th quartile represents the worst for example in the first table entitled “dotcom crash” you will see “” in the st and nd quartiles for each of the two indexes
