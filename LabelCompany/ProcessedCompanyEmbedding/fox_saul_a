of a forestwith their four fox childrenexpedition continuedmr fox and the farmersevery night for dinner mr fox would steal a bird from one of the three farmers boggis bunce and bean were all aware of this they hid out every night awaiting the foxs arrival but mr fox always made sure that the wind was blowing in his face so the scent of any awaiting farmer would slip into his tiny nostrils and mr

speechattuugbuiclimaxrising actionthe planboggis bunce and bean got so fed up with mr fox stealing their birds that they made a plan they would hide outside the fox hole and shoot mr fox when he came outthe shootingthe three farmers hid outside the fox hole just as mr fox came outbang bang bangall that was left was a motionless orange tailthe farmers realized that mr fox was still alive and that he obviously wasnt coming out of that hole so they went to get shovelsbeanboggisbunceexpeditionboggis bunce and beanone fat one short one leanthese horrible crooksso different in lookswere nonetheless equally meanbean farms turkeys and apples he is very skinny and tall because he doesnt anything he only drinks hard apple ciderboggis farms chickens he is the fastest because he eats chicken for breasfast lunch and dinner every daybunce farms geese and ducks he is the shortest and only eats doughnuts filled with a paste made from goose liverclimax continuedmrs fox was in the middle of bandaging the stump where mr foxs tail once was when they heard the ground crumbling above them mr and mrs fox gathered their four children and started digging as fast as they could they dug a deep hole and stayed there all nightboggis bunce and bean realized that manual shovels were not going to get the job done quickly so they went to get the mechanical shovelsmeanwhileclimax continuedboggis bunce and bean started to dig out mr fox by the end of the day the hill was a crater all the foxes dug furiously until they could dig no more as the sun went down the farmers sent for tents and food and cider for bean they also sent for the men that worked on their farms the men would surround the hill and stand guard during the night with a gun and a flashlight with orders to shoot the foxalso boggis bunce and bean vowed that they would not leave the crater until they shot mr fox deadth gradefalling actionmrs fox was weak she could no longer dig so the children and mr fox set out on an adventure they dug and dug and dug then went to the surface and they were under boggis chicken house number one they grabbed  plump chickens and one of the children took it to mrs fox to roastboggis bunce and bean still waited for mr fox to come outfalling action continuedafter mr fox stole from boggis he was digging another tunnel with the remaining three children when suddenly they heard a voice then out of the tunnel came mr badger and his son mr badger said that every animal in the forest was starving and that they needed food mr badgers son went to tell all the animals of the forest that they were invited to mr foxs feast while mr fox his children and mr badger snuck into bunces giant storehouse they stole  ducks  geese  hams and  bunches of carrots for the rabbitsbunces giant storehouseboggiss chicken house number onediggingdiggingfalling action continued beans secret cider cellarafter mr fox stole from boggis and bunce he went with mr badger and his remmaining child to beans secret cider cellar they dug into the cellar and found a rat sipping one of the cider jugs mr fox threatened to eat him and the rat left they were about to get a jug of cider of a shelf when they heard footsteps they hid behind jug of cider they saw a hand take the two jugs of cider that were right beside them then the hand was on the jug of cider they were behind but then the person opted not to and went back upstaris mr fox his kid and mr badger grabbed  jugs of cider and went back to the holeresolutionthe feastwhen mr fox came back all the animals were already eating mr fox then gave a speech he said that all the animals would live in an underground community and build streets and homes and steal from all the farmers until they were all dead all the animals celebrated fantastic mr foxas for boggis bunce and bean they are still waiting for mr fox to come out of the holemoralthe moral of this story is that if you keep doing the same thing and waiting for something new to happen nothing new will ever happen this is demonstrated by boggis bunce and bean they kept digging instead of trying something else and were outsmarted by mr fox this means to try something new and you will be successfulpersonal recomendationi would not recommend this book to people overall the book wasnt that exciting or emotional it was a bit dull and boring the plot was original though i liked the book but didnt love itthe endabout the bookfantastic mr fox was written by roald dahl the book was published in  the movie version was released in theaters in  and full

google plus print article adjust font size aa aa aa aa aa aa aa by jonah goldberg april    am jonahnro before there was trump there was o’reilly’s populism infused with a new york sensibility editor’s note the following is jonah goldberg’s weekly “news”letter the gfile subscribe here to get the gfile delivered to your inbox on fridays dear reader i said “reader” this will not be the venue for caitlyn jenner’s nude debut bill o’reilly is leaving fox and i can’t say i’ll miss him i don’t mean that to sound too harsh not that he much cared about sounding too harsh the truth is i almost never watched his show unless it was on someplace where i didn’t have control of the remote that’s not quite the slight it may seem to be either my job often makes me feel like lucy at the chocolate factory the last thing she wanted to do after a sisyphean day of eating chocolate off the conveyor belt was tuck into a big box of chocolates at home i watch the news at  pm and then unless there’s some compelling workrelated reason i’m done with that stuff until morning true story the first time i appeared on special report i told bret baier that i was worried i might have an episode since the show was my body’s pavlovian cue to have a cocktail i’d rather watch the same episode of game of thrones over and over than spend an hour watching a new episode of the o’reilly factor but that goes for rachel maddow and certainly that lawrence o’donnell guy and the rest of them just as much if not more so i love hearing ads for maddow’s show on satellite radio in which she promises to “report the news without fear or favor” — which is sort of like the hosts of america’s next top model saying they only care about inner beauty of course i’d occasionally stumble on o’reilly’s show and rubberneck at the spectacle but i didn’t enjoy it i was never on the show much i don’t enjoy being a meat prop for hosts to make the points they want to make and i guess it showed the few times i was on o’reilly was the master of making his long and often wellcrafted statements in the form of a question “now i think   ” “this is the way i see it   ” “this is where i come down on this   ” often preceded a jeremiad that concluded with “do you agree” the answer was merely punctuation for the next “question” some people got better treatment — dennis miller the other goldberg — but for the most part guests were there either to serve as a greek chorus or as ritual human sacrifice for his smartestguyatthebar routine and it worked well people can scoff and roll their eyes but o’reilly’s talent is impossible to dispute on objective grounds there are lots of acts i don’t like but i can respect for the skill behind them i don’t like hiphop or opera for that matter but i can still see the difference between people who are really good at it and people who aren’t  as with the man in don quixote who could inflate a dog through its butt one doesn’t have to like the show to appreciate the expertise  i guess what i always resented was the way o’reilly — and some of his cheaper knockoffs — claimed an authority to speak for me alinsky to the left of me alinsky to the right of me ian tuttle and david french both wrote excellent pieces for nro yesterday and i agree with both of them for the most part david’s point that celebrity conservatism is swamping intellectual conservatism is particularly welltaken david writes the cost has been a loss of integrity and crucially a loss of emphasis on ideas and more important ideals there exists in some quarters an assumption that if you’re truly going to “fight” then you have to be ready to get your hands dirty you can’t be squeamish about details like truth or civility or decency when searching for ideological gladiators we emphasize their knifework not their character or integrity i agree with david that this is partly a feature of the culture generally these days “watch jon stewart stephen colbert samantha bee etc destroy” this or that republican is just one facet of the riot of confirmation bias and tribalism that defines our times and conservatives play the same game my friend tucker carlson has had a meteoric run of late in part because he is so good at bringing fresh lambs to the slaughter every night first at  pm then  pm and now in o’reilly’s spot i fully expect tucker’s ratings to be just as spectacular as o’reilly’s were if not at first then in short order and we should not pretend this is as new as it may seem the novelty is in the degree not the phenomenon even the sainted william f buckley derived no small part of his appeal from the fact that he could always oneup any condescending liberal egghead that was a big part of his legacy at a time when the media wanted desperately to paint conservatives as paranoid antiintellectual bigots in the george wallace mode buckley’s sesquipedalian erudition served as a kind of reassurance but buckley brought something else to the table civility selfdeprecation and a playful wit that could be intellectually devastating without being humiliating even when he explained that robert f kennedy was ducking his invitations to appear on firing line — “why does baloney reject the grinder” — liberals had to chuckle in admiration it’s that touch which has largely gone missing of late intellectually buckley was a passionate believer that liberalism was the enemy but liberals themselves were merely the opposition gore vidal notwithstanding where did that come from again much of it is a product of the times stemming from new technology economics and other deeprooted causes but i want to focus on one over the last decade conservatives have developed a severe case of alinsky envy it is one of the oldest insights into human nature that envy corrupts the soul aquinas defined envy as sadness for the good of others but alinsky envy is corrupting in a different way for years now conservatism has convinced itself that the left wins by in effect cheating they lie they only care about power they demonize and slander their opponents i’m not going to sit here and claim that there’s zero merit to that argument there’s a lot of merit even if it’s often an exaggeration my objection is the conclusion conservatives draw from it we’ve got to take the gloves off and play by the same rules alinsky’s rules as david kahane eye roll puts it “become what you behold” a whole cottage industry on the right has thrived around this argument and on the whole it’s grotesque you cannot argue that your enemy is evil and uses evil means and at the same time argue “we should do it too” it’s particularly hypocritical given that alinsky envy blossomed alongside obsessions with conservative purity it is a circle that will not square our ideology has a monopoly on virtue but in order for virtue to triumph we must act like people we claim are virtueless the effort to make this argument work is inherently corrupting because it inexorably replaces ends with means “winning” gets redefined before our eyes into anything that fuels our ecstatic schadenfreude over the suffering of our opponents whenever trump did something indefensible the “defense” “but he fights” would pour forth and that brings me to ian’s piece i have some subtle disagreements with it i think ian paints too bright a line between younger conservatives supposedly alienated by trump and older fox news demographic conservatives i wish it were true but the throngs of young people who go to bigtent revivals headlined by ann coulter and milo yiannopoulos — not to mention more seriousminded but nonetheless alinskyensorcelled types like dinesh d’souza david horowitz and others — don’t reassure me the long island captivity i think there’s an element to the story that ian — and pretty much everyone else — has missed in how donald trump won over so many people at fox news and beyond a little backstory i grew up in new york city in the s and s oswald spengler couldn’t do justice to the dismay that was bound up in the city’s decline lots of people left the city for the suburbs particularly places like long island long an enclave for workingclass and more affluent suburbanites who make their living in or off of the city but for understandable reasons don’t want to raise kids there whether you stayed in the city or got out there was a sense that liberalism broadly defined was destroying the city then along came a white knight from the outer boroughs and nassau county in long island rudy giuliani transformed new york literally saving the city but he wasn’t really that conservative he was prochoice progay rights and proimmigration that didn’t stop his enemies from calling him a fascist and extremist remember these were the days when you were considered a rightwinger if you thought porn theaters were a blight and that drugaddled homeless slubberdegullions terrifying old ladies and small children were merely exercising their civil rights giuliani was a bit authoritarian but he needed to be to fight the democratic machine the media and the remoralike lawyers racialhucksters and bureaucrats that were running the city into the ground giuliani’s politics were a nostalgialaden homage to the memory of a bigapplethatwas and a kind of conservative common sense his greatest ally in the press was the urbanpopulist new york post which always could be counted on to take the side of the little guy and the tots innocent children against mordor’s army of pervs reprobates pimps fat cats and corrupts pols giuliani’s promise was in effect to make new york great again and again he largely succeeded just as important he humiliated his enemies in the process bill o’reilly grew up in long island before the city started to decline but he is incontestably a product of the nostalgiabesotted workingclass worldview that giuliani tapped into he doesn’t call himself a conservative but a “traditionalist” and his vision of tradition isn’t burkean oakshottian or hayekian he doesn’t harken to russell kirk’s mecosta but to levittown and to an extent that’s fine america could use a bit more s levittown morality sean hannity born in new york city but raised in long island is another who largely fits that mold more broadly as i’ve written dozens of times fox news was always more populist than conservative but its populism is often infused with a new york sensibility this was always the core of donald trump’s act even when he was a proud democrat a bridgeandtunnel billionaire he always had a chip on his shoulder about new york elites it wasn’t quite the same irishcatholic chip that o’reilly had but the similarities are more interesting than the differences o’reilly’s intellectual insecurity drives him to churn out gimmicky histories written by someone else trump’s spills out in boasts about his grades and his superior brain they both insist they’re the smartest man in the room and that people who disagree with their meniscusthin judgments are not just wrong but bad or stupid trump’s nostalgic appeal to make america great again using common sense to defeat the pinhead elites combined with his implied promise to humiliate his enemies with his strength and will was simply a variant of o’reillyism indeed bill o’reilly was the john the baptist of trumpism long before donald trump appeared on the political scene i should say that i wish donald trump were a rudy giuliani and i hold out the barest glimmer of hope that he could turn into one but my suspicion is that he is a creature who mimicked the aesthetics and style of a giuliani without anything like his discipline or expertise and that in itself is a sign of the toxic corruption of celebrity conservatism that david french describes too many people think being a conservative is all about the public posture the performance in front of the camera and not the performance on the job i have no idea if o’reilly will find his way back on tv but if i had to bet i’d bet big that he will tv is a drug for some people for some it’s about the money and doing good work to be sure but for others they come to believe that they will cease to exist if people don’t recognize them at airports greta van susteren for instance is a multimillionaire but i have every confidence that she thinks she’d dry up and blow away if she weren’t on tv lord knows o’reilly doesn’t need the money but that’s not the itch people like him need to scratch     various  sundry   i started writing this in the main street diner in grove city pa i am finishing it in the parking lot of a fairfield inn in slippery rock i know it sounds weird that i should be hurling epistolary and eristic brickbats at donald trump’s politically fissiparous rodomontade through the machicolations of the internet but i was invited to share my hortatory stylings at grove city college last night i had a great time even though the fake news media will never tell you how huge the crowd was i required sustenance hence the main street diner i’m in the parking lot at the fairfield inn because i am smoking a cigar with the top down on my car and i need someplace to park in the shade i know i shouldn’t smoke in the morning but sometimes i suffer from a lack of cacoëthes scribendi and this is the only way to extravasate my creative juices but what explains this apparent exercise in sesquipedalian epeolatry the other day i was baited into a twitter affray or social media arglebargle by a dasypygal rantallian who made the following claim so i thought it a propitious opportunity to share my effulgent logophilia even if i risk being accused of the sin of batrachomyomachy by taking so much time to respond to an anencephalous troll i don’t want to be seen as absquatulating before i demonstrated my point subjecting me to a severe case of torschlusspanik but as the kids say i think i’ve thrown enough shade in a splendiferously umbriferous manner canine update the beasts are still adjusting to the fact that the fair jessica is working outside the house for the first time in almost a decade they become much needier and more excited when i come home but they’ve also learned to amuse themselves more when they are not dreaming of more exciting adventures pippa has developed a new theory she seems to think that if she holds perfectly still we won’t notice her in places she’s not supposed to be i wish i had more stories to share but i can’t think of any so instead puppy pictures icymi   last week’s gfile trump’s pivot to easy wins death penalty
