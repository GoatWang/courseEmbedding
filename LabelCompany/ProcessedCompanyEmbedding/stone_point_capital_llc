funds about us our team our investments investment process news contact us partner login investment process elephant process investment opportunities stone point capitals valueadd elephant process stone point capital’s “elephant process” is the methodology through which we identify a specific sector of financial services to target for investment deeply research the space meet and develop relationships with management teams and identify actionable investment opportunities it is a targeted proactive repeatable process that we apply to more than forty sectors of financial services and that is employed by every member of our investment team many of the investments made by the trident funds have originated as a result of the elephant process which combines “top down” evaluating and selecting sectors based on carefully considered investment theses and “bottom up” assigning a team of investment professionals to get to know at a granular level the leading companies and managers in these sectors approaches to identifying investment opportunities identifying attractive opportunities through this targeted process can take many years but we believe that it enables us to produce high quality proprietary investment opportunities in sectors where we face limited competition as a result of this process more than threequarters of the investments made by the trident funds since  have been internally generated  copyright  stone point capital llc all rights reserved contact us stone point capital llc company profile  bloomberg feedback stone point capital llc private company
