and  debt securities and may purchase us exchangedtraded and overthe counter otc put and call options the fund realizes fees referred to as premiums for granting the rights evidenced by the options it has written a put option embodies the right of its purchaser to compel the writer of the option to purchase from the option holder an underlying security at a specified price for a specified time period or at a specified time in contrast a call option embodies the right of its purchaser to compel the writer of the option to sell to the option holder an underlying security at a specified price for a specified time period or at a specified time the principal reason for writing covered options on a security is to attempt to realize through the receipt of premiums a greater return than would be realized on the securities alone in return for a premium the fund as the writer of a covered call option forfeits the right to any appreciation in the value of the underlying security above the strike price for the life of the option or until a closing purchase transaction can be effected nevertheless the fund as a call writer retains the risk of a decline in the price of the underlying security the size of the premiums that the fund may receive may be adversely affected as new or existing institutions including other investment companies engage in or increase their optionwriting activities in the case of options written by the fund that are deemed covered by virtue of the funds holding convertible or exchangeable preferred stock or debt securities the time required to convert or exchange and obtain physical delivery of the underlying common stock with respect to which the fund has written options may exceed the time within which the fund must make delivery in accordance with an exercise notice in these instances the fund may purchase or temporarily borrow the underlying securities for purposes of physical delivery by so doing a fund will not bear any market risk since the fund will have the absolute right to receive from a paposrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd the issuer of the underlying security an equal number of shares to replace the borrowed securities but the fund may incur additional transaction costs or interest expenses in connection with any such purchase or borrowing additional risks exist with respect to certain of the securities for which the fund may write covered call options for example if the fund writes covered call options on mortgagebacked securities the mortgagebacked securities that it holds as cover may because of scheduled amortization or unscheduled prepayments cease to be sufficient cover if this occurs the fund will compensate for the decline in the value of the cover by purchasing an appropriate additional amount of mortgagebacked securities options written by the fund will normally have expiration dates between one and twelve months from the date written the exercise price of the options may be below equal to or above the market values of the underlying securities at the times the options are written in the case of call options these exercise prices are referred to as inthemoney atthemoney and outofthemoney respectively the fund may write i inthemoney call options when the adviser expects that the price of the underlying security will remain flat or decline moderately during the option period ii atthemoney call options when the adviser expects that the price of the underlying security will remain flat or advance moderately during the option period and iii outofthemoney call options when the adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option plus the appreciation in market price of the underlying security up to the exercise price will be greater than the appreciation in the price of the underlying security alone in any of the preceding situations if the market price of the underlying security declines and the security is sold at this lower price the amount of any realized loss will be offset wholly or in part by the premium received to secure its obligation to deliver the underlying security when it writes a call option the fund will be required to deposit in escrow the underlying security or other assets in accordance with the rules of the options clearing corporation the clearing corporation and of the securities exchange on which the option is written prior to their expirations put and call options may be sold in closing sale or purchase transactions sales or purchases by the fund prior to the exercise of options that it has purchased or written respectively of options of the same series in which the fund may realize a profit or loss from the sale an option position may be closed out only where there exists a secondary market for an option of the same series on a recognized securities exchange or in the overthecounter market when the fund has purchased an option and engages in a closing sale transaction whether the fund realizes a profit or loss will depend upon whether the amount received in the closing sale transaction is more or less than the premium the fund initially paid for the original option plus the related transaction costs similarly in cases where the fund has written an option it will realize a profit if the cost of the closing purchase transaction is less than the premium received upon writing the original option and will incur a loss if the cost of the closing purchase transaction exceeds the premium received upon writing the original option the fund may engage in a closing purchase transaction to realize a profit to prevent an underlying security with respect to which it has written an option from being called or put or in the case of a call option to unfreeze an underlying security thereby permitting its sale or the writing of a new option on the security prior to the outstanding options expiration the obligation of the fund under an option it has written would be terminated by a closing purchase transaction but the fund would not be deemed to own an option as a result of the transaction a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th so long as the obligation of the fund as the writer of an option continues the fund may be assigned an exercise notice by the brokerdealer through which the option was sold requiring the fund to deliver the underlying security against payment of the exercise price this obligation terminates when the option expires or the fund effects a closing purchase transaction the fund can no longer effect a closing purchase transaction with respect to an option once it has been assigned an exercise notice there is no assurance that sufficient trading interest will exist to create a liquid secondary market on a securities exchange for any particular option or at any particular time and for some options no such secondary market may exist a liquid secondary market in an option may cease to exist for a variety of reasons in the past for example higher than anticipated trading activity or order flow or other unforeseen events have at times rendered certain of the facilities of the clearing corporation and various securities exchanges inadequate and resulted in the institution of special procedures such as trading rotations restrictions on certain types of orders or trading halts or suspensions in one or more options there can be no assurance that similar events or events that may otherwise interfere with the timely execution of customers orders will not recur in such event it might not be possible to effect closing transactions in particular options moreover the funds ability to terminate options positions established in the overthecounter market may be more limited than for exchangetraded options and may also involve the risk that securities dealers participating in overthecounter transactions would fail to meet their obligations to the fund the fund however intends to purchase overthecounter options only from dealers whose debt securities as determined by the adviser are considered to be investment grade if as a covered call option writer the fund is unable to effect a closing purchase transaction in a secondary market it will not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expires or it delivers the underlying security upon exercise in either case the fund would continue to be at market risk on the security and could face higher transaction costs including brokerage commissions securities exchanges generally have established limitations governing the maximum number of calls and puts of each class which may be held or written or exercised within certain time periods by an investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written on the same or different securities exchanges or are held written or exercised in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers it is possible that the fund and other clients of the adviser and certain of its affiliates may be considered to be such a group a securities exchange may order the liquidation of positions found to be in violation of these limits and it may impose certain other sanctions these limits may restrict the number of options the fund will be able to purchase on a particular security stock index options the fund may purchase and write exchangelisted and  otc put and call options on stock indexes a stock index measures the movement of a certain group of stocks by assigning relative values to the common stocks included in the index

such as the standard  poors  indexes may also be based on a particular industry or market segment a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th options on stock indexes are similar to options on stock except that i the expiration cycles of stock index options are monthly while those of stock options are currently quarterly and ii the delivery requirements are different instead of giving the right to take or make delivery of stock at a specified price an option on a stock index gives the holder the right to receive a cash exercise settlement amount equal to a the amount if any by which the fixed exercise price of the option exceeds in the case of a put or is less than in the case of a call the closing value of the underlying index on the date of exercise multiplied by b a fixed index multiplier receipt of this cash amount will depend upon the closing level of the stock index upon which the option is based being greater than in the case of a call or less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the index and the exercise price of the option times a specified multiple the writer of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount stock index options may be offset by entering into closing transactions as described above for securities options otc options the fund may purchase otc or dealer options or sell otc  options unlike exchangelisted options where an intermediary or clearing corporation such as the clearing corporation assures that all transactions in such options are properly executed the responsibility for performing all transactions with respect to otc options rests solely with the writer and the holder of those options a listed call option writer for example is obligated to deliver the underlying stock to the clearing organization if the option is exercised and the clearing organization is then obligated to pay the writer the exercise price of the option if the fund were to purchase a dealer option however it would rely on the dealer from whom it purchased the option to perform if the option were exercised if the dealer fails to honor the exercise of the option by the fund the fund would lose the premium it paid for the option and the expected benefit of the transaction listed options generally have a continuous liquid market while dealer options have none consequently the fund will generally be able to realize the value of a dealer option it has purchased only by exercising it or reselling it to the dealer who issued it similarly when the fund writes a dealer option it generally will be able to close out the option prior to its expiration only by entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which the fund originally wrote the option although the fund will seek to enter into dealer options only with dealers who will agree to and that are expected to be capable of entering into closing transactions with the fund there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to liquidate a dealer option at a favorable price at any time prior to expiration the inability to enter into a closing transaction may result in material losses to the fund until the fund as a covered otc call option writer is able to effect a closing purchase transaction it will not be able to liquidate securities or other assets used to cover the written option until the option expires or is exercised this requirement may impair the funds ability to sell portfolio securities or with respect to currency options currencies at a time when such sale might be advantageous in the event of insolvency of the other party the fund may be unable to liquidate a dealer option futures activities the fund may enter into foreign currency interest  rate and stock index futures contracts

involving futures contracts and options on futures contracts to the extent allowed by cftc regulations in effect from time to time and in accordance with the funds policies there is no overall limit

defaults by the other party to such instruments than is available for currency instruments traded on an exchange such contracts are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the contract will

for such contracts exists although the fund intends to enter into futures contracts only if there is an active market for such contracts there is no assurance that an active market will exist at any particular time most futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the day it is possible that futures contract prices could move to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions at an advantageous price and subjecting the fund to substantial losses in such event and in the event of adverse price movements the fund would be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin in such situations if the fund had insufficient cash it might have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin requirements at a time when it would be disadvantageous to do so in addition if the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes in such circumstances the fund may realize a loss on a futures contract or option that is not offset by an increase in the value of the hedged position losses incurred in futures transactions and the costs of these transactions will affect the funds performance options on futures contracts the fund may purchase and write put and call options on foreign currency interest rate and stock index futures contracts and may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate existing positions there is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be effected the ability to establish and close out positions on such options will be subject to the existence of a liquid market an option on a currency interest rate or stock index futures contract as contrasted with the direct investment in such a contract gives the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option the writer of the option is required upon exercise to assume an offsetting futures position a short position if the option is a call and a long position if the option is a put upon exercise of an option the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writers futures margin account which represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option on the futures contract the potential loss related to the purchase of an option on futures contracts is limited to the premium paid for the option plus transaction costs because the value of the option is fixed at the point of sale there are no daily cash payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying contract however the value of the option does change daily and that change would be reflected in the net asset value of the fund a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th currency exchange transactions the value in us dollars of the assets of  the fund that are invested in foreign securities may be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in exchange control regulations and the fund may incur costs in connection with conversion between various currencies currency exchange transactions may be from any nonus currency into us dollars or into other appropriate currencies the fund will conduct its currency exchange transactions i on a spot ie cash basis at the rate prevailing in the currency exchange market ii through entering into futures contracts or options on such contracts as described above iii through entering into forward contracts to purchase or sell currency or iv by purchasing exchangetraded currency options forward currency contracts a forward currency contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract as agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract these contracts are entered into in the interbank market conducted directly between currency traders usually large commercial banks and brokers and their customers forward currency contracts are similar to currency futures contracts except that futures contracts are traded on commodities exchanges and are standardized as to contract size and delivery date at or before the maturity of a forward contract the fund may either sell a portfolio security and make delivery of the currency or retain the security and fully or partially offset its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by negotiating with its trading partner to purchase a second offsetting contract if the fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting transaction the fund at the time of execution of the offsetting transaction will incur a gain or a loss to the extent that movement has occurred in forward contract prices currency options the fund may purchase exchangetraded put and call options on foreign currencies put options convey the right to sell the underlying currency at a price which is anticipated to be higher than the spot price of the currency at the time the option is exercised call options convey the right to buy the underlying currency at a price which is expected to be lower than the spot price of the currency at the time the option is exercised currency hedging the funds currency hedging will be limited to hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions in the aggregate transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward currency with respect to specific receivables or payables of the fund generally accruing in connection with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities position hedging is the sale of forward currency with respect to portfolio security positions the fund may not position hedge to an extent greater than the aggregate market value at the time of entering into the hedge of the hedged securities a decline in the us dollar value of a foreign currency in which the funds securities are denominated will reduce the us dollar value of the securities even if their value in the foreign currency remains constant the use of currency hedges does not eliminate fluctuations in the underlying prices of the securities but it does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future for example in order to protect against diminutions in the us dollar value of securities it holds the fund may purchase currency put options if the value of the currency does decline the fund will have the right to sell the currency for a fixed amount in dollars and will thereby offset in whole or in part the adverse effect on the us dollar value of its securities that a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th otherwise would have resulted conversely if a rise in the us dollar value of a currency in which securities to be acquired are denominated is projected thereby potentially increasing the cost of the securities the fund may purchase call options on the particular currency the purchase of these options could offset at least partially the effects of the adverse movements in exchange rates the benefit to the fund derived from purchases of currency options like the benefit derived from other types of options will be reduced by premiums and other transaction costs because transactions in currency exchange are generally conducted on a principal basis no fees or commissions are generally involved currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other transactions with similar instruments although currency hedges limit the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of a hedged currency at the same time they also limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the currency increase if a devaluation is generally anticipated the fund may not be able to contract to sell a currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates while the values of currency futures and options on futures forward currency contracts and currency options may be expected to correlate with exchange rates they will not reflect other factors that may affect the value of the funds investments and a currency hedge may not be entirely successful in mitigating changes in the value of the funds investments denominated in that currency a currency hedge for example should protect a yendenominated bond against a decline in the yen but will not protect the fund against a price decline if the issuers creditworthiness deteriorates swaps the fund may enter into swaps relating to indexes currencies and  equity interests of foreign issuers a swap transaction is an agreement between the fund and a counterparty to act in accordance with the terms of the swap contract index swaps involve the exchange by the fund with another party of the respective amounts payable with respect to a notional principal amount related to one or more indexes currency swaps involve the exchange of cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on their relative future values an equity swap is an agreement to exchange streams of payments computed by reference to a notional amount based on the performance of a basket of stocks or a single stock the fund may enter into these transactions to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its assets to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities the fund anticipates purchasing at a later date the fund may also use these transactions for speculative purposes such as to obtain the price performance of a security without actually purchasing the security in circumstances for example the subject security is illiquid is unavailable for direct investment or available only on less attractive terms swaps have risks associated with them including possible default by the counterparty to the transaction illiquidity and where swaps are used as hedges the risk that the use of a swap could result in losses greater than if the swap had not been employed the fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the agreement with the fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments swaps do not involve the delivery of securities other underlying assets or principal accordingly the risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of payments that the fund is contractually obligated to make if the counterparty to a swap defaults the funds risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the fund is contractually entitled to receive where a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th swaps are entered into for good faith hedging purposes the adviser believes such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the investment company act of  as amended the  act and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to the funds borrowing restrictions where swaps are entered into for other than hedging purposes the fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid securities having a value equal to the accrued excess of its obligations over entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis hedging in addition to entering into options futures and currency  exchange transactions for other purposes including generating current income to offset expenses or increase return a fund may enter into these transactions as hedges to reduce investment risk generally by making an investment expected to move in the opposite direction of a portfolio position a hedge is designed to offset a loss in a portfolio position with a gain in the hedged position at the same time however a properly correlated hedge will result in a gain in the portfolio position being offset by a loss in the hedged position as a result the use of options futures contracts and currency exchange transactions for hedging purposes could limit any potential gain from an increase in the value of the position hedged in addition the movement in the portfolio position hedged may not be of the same magnitude as movement in the hedge with respect to futures contracts since the value of portfolio securities will far exceed the value of the futures contracts sold by the fund an increase in the value of the futures contracts could only mitigate but not totally offset the decline in the value of the funds assets in hedging transactions based on an index whether the fund will realize a gain or loss from the purchase or writing of options on an index depends upon movements in the level of stock prices in the stock market generally or in the case of certain indexes in an industry or market segment rather than movements in the price of a particular stock the risk of imperfect correlation increases as the composition of the funds portfolio varies from the composition of the index in an effort to compensate for imperfect correlation of relative movements in the hedged position and the hedge the funds hedge positions may be in a greater or lesser dollar amount than the dollar amount of the hedged position such over hedging or under hedging may adversely affect the funds net investment results if market movements are not as anticipated when the hedge is established stock index futures transactions may be subject to additional correlation risks first all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which would distort the normal relationship between the stock index and futures markets secondly from the point of view of speculators the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities market therefore increased participation by speculators in the futures market also may cause temporary price distortions because of the possibility of price distortions in the futures market and the imperfect correlation between movements in the stock index and movements in the price of stock index futures a correct forecast of general market trends by the adviser still may not result in a successful hedging transaction the fund will engage in hedging transactions only when deemed advisable by the adviser and successful use by the fund of hedging transactions will be subject to the advisers ability to predict trends in currency interest rate or securities markets as the case may be and to correctly predict movements in the directions of the hedge and the hedged position and the correlation between them which predictions could prove to be inaccurate this requires a paposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the price of individual securities and there can be no assurance that the use of these strategies will be successful even a wellconceived hedge may be unsuccessful to some degree because of unexpected market behavior or trends losses incurred in hedging transactions and the costs of these transactions will affect the funds performance asset coverage for forward contracts options futures and options on  futures the fund will comply with guidelines established by the us securities  and exchange commission the sec with respect to coverage of forward currency contracts options written by the fund on securities and indexes and currency interest rate and index futures contracts and options on these futures contracts these guidelines may in certain instances require segregation by the fund of cash or liquid securities for example a call option written by the fund on securities may require the fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the securities without additional consideration or to segregate assets as described above sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option written by the fund on an index may require the fund to own portfolio securities that correlate with the index or to segregate assets as described above equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis the fund could purchase a put option if the strike price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option sold by the fund if the fund holds a futures or forward contract the fund could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held the fund may enter into fully or partially offsetting transactions so that its net position coupled with any segregated assets equal to any remaining obligation equals its net obligation asset coverage may be achieved by other means when consistent with applicable regulatory policies additional information on other investment practices  foreign investments investors should recognize that investing in foreign  companies involves certain risks including those discussed below which are not typically associated with investing in us issuers foreign currency exchange since the fund may invest in securities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and since the fund may temporarily hold funds in bank deposits or other money market investments denominated in foreign currencies the fund may be affected favorably or unfavorably by exchange control regulations or changes in the exchange rate between such currencies and the dollar a change in the value of a foreign currency relative to the us dollar will result in a corresponding change in the dollar value of fund assets denominated in that foreign currency changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the value of dividends and interest earned gains and losses realized on the sale of securities and net investment income and gains if any to be distributed to shareholders by the fund the rate of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies is determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets changes in the exchange rate may result over time from the interaction of many factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in the united states and a particular foreign country including economic and political developments in other countries of particular importance are rates of a paposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd inflation interest rate levels the balance of payments and the extent of government surpluses or deficits in the united states and the particular foreign country all of which are in turn sensitive to the monetary fiscal and trade policies pursued by the governments of the united states and foreign countries important to international trade and finance governmental intervention may also play a significant role national governments rarely voluntarily allow their currencies to float freely in response to economic forces sovereign governments use a variety of techniques such as intervention by a countrys central bank or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes to affect the exchange rates of their currencies the fund may use hedging techniques with the objective of protecting against loss through the fluctuation of the value of the yen against the us dollar particularly the forward market in foreign exchange currency options and currency futures see currency exchange transactions and futures activities above information there may be less publicly available information about foreign securities and about the foreign company or government issuing them than is available about a domestic company or government entity foreign companies are generally not subject to uniform financial reporting standards practices and requirements comparable to those applicable to us companies political instability with respect to some foreign countries there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitations on the removal of funds or other assets of a fund political or social instability or domestic developments which could affect us investments in those and neighboring countries delays securities of some foreign companies are less liquid and their prices are more volatile than securities of comparable us companies certain foreign countries are known to experience long delays between the trade and settlement dates of securities purchased or sold foreign debt securities the returns on foreign debt securities reflect interest rates and other market conditions prevailing in those countries and the effect of gains and losses in the denominated currencies against the us dollar which have had a substantial impact on investment in foreign fixedincome securities the relative performance of various countries fixedincome markets historically has reflected wide variations relating to the unique characteristics of each countrys economy yeartoyear fluctuations in certain markets have been significant and negative returns have been experienced in various markets from time to time the foreign government securities in which the fund may invest generally consist of obligations issued or backed by national state or provincial governments or similar political subdivisions or central banks in foreign countries foreign government securities also include debt obligations of supranational entities which include international organizations designated or backed by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or development international banking institutions and related government agencies examples include the international bank for reconstruction and development world bank the european coal and steel community the asian development bank and the interamerican development bank foreign government securities also include debt securities of quasigovernmental agencies and debt securities denominated in multinational currency units of an issuer including a paposrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd supranational issuers debt securities of quasigovernmental agencies are issued by entities owned by either a national state or equivalent government or are obligations of a political unit that is not backed by the national governments full faith and credit and general taxing powers general individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments positions the fund may invest in securities of foreign governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof and many if not all of the foregoing considerations apply to such investments as well depositary receipts the assets of the fund may be invested in the  securities of foreign issuers in the form of american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs and international depositary receipts idrs these securities may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the securities into which they may be converted adrs are receipts typically issued by a us bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation edrs which are sometimes referred to as continental depositary receipts are receipts issued in europe and idrs which are sometimes referred to as global depositary receipts are issued outside the united states edrs and idrs are typically issued by nonus banks and trust companies and evidence ownership of either foreign or domestic securities generally adrs in registered form are designed for use in us securities markets and edrs and idrs in bearer form are designed for use in european and nonus securities markets respectively us government securities the fund may invest in debt obligations of  varying maturities issued or guaranteed by the united states government its agencies or instrumentalities us government securities direct obligations of the us treasury include a variety of securities that differ in their interest rates maturities and dates of issuance us government securities also include securities issued or guaranteed by the federal housing administration farmers home loan administration exportimport bank of the united states small business administration government national mortgage association gnma general services administration central bank for cooperatives federal farm credit banks federal home loan banks federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc federal intermediate credit banks federal land banks federal national mortgage association fnma maritime administration tennessee valley authority district of columbia armory board and student loan marketing association the fund may also invest in instruments that are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury and instruments that are supported by the credit of the instrumentality because the us government is not obligated by law to provide support to an instrumentality it sponsors the fund will invest in obligations issued by such an instrumentality only if the adviser determines that the credit risk with respect to the instrumentality does not make its securities unsuitable for investment by the fund below investment grade securities the market values of below investment  grade securities and unrated securities of comparable quality tend to react less to fluctuations in interest rate levels than do those of investment grade securities and the market values of certain of these securities also tend to be more sensitive to individual corporate developments and changes in economic conditions than below investment grade securities in addition these securities generally present a higher degree of credit risk issuers of these securities are often highly a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th leveraged and may not have more traditional methods of financing available to them so that their ability to service their obligations during an economic downturn or during sustained periods of rising interest rates may be impaired the risk of loss due to default by such issuers is significantly greater because below investment grade securities generally are unsecured and frequently are subordinated to prior payment of senior indebtedness the fund may have difficulty disposing of certain of these securities because there may be a thin trading market because there is no established retail secondary market for many of these securities the fund anticipates that these securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or institutional investors to the extent a secondary trading market for these securities does exist it generally is not as liquid as the secondary market for investment grade securities the lack of a liquid secondary market as well as adverse publicity and investor perception with respect to these securities may have an adverse impact on market price and the funds ability to dispose of particular issues when necessary to meet liquidity needs or in response to a specific economic event such as a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuer the lack of a liquid secondary market for certain securities also may make it more difficult for the fund to obtain accurate market quotations for purposes of valuing the fund and calculating net asset value the market value of securities rated below investment grade is more volatile than that of investment grade securities factors adversely impacting the market value of these securities will adversely impact the funds net asset value the fund will rely on the judgment analysis and experience of the adviser in evaluating the creditworthiness of an issuer in this evaluation the adviser will take into consideration among other things the issuers financial resources its sensitivity to economic conditions and trends its operating history the quality of the issuers management and regulatory matters normally below investment grade securities and comparable unrated securities are not intended for shortterm investment the fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal or interest on its portfolio holdings of such securities securities of other investment companies the fund may invest in securities  of other investment companies to the extent permitted under the  act presently under the  act the fund may hold securities of another investment company in amounts which i do not exceed  of the total outstanding voting stock of such company ii do not exceed  of the value of the funds total assets and iii when added to all other investment company securities held by the fund do not exceed  of the value of the funds total assets diamonds spdrs and webs equity equivalents diamonds dow jones  industrial average model new depositary shares and spdrs standard  poors depositary

series of an investment company that are designed to replicate the performance of a particular foreign equity market index equity equivalents may be used for several purposes including to simulate full investment in the underlying index while retaining a cash balance for fund management a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th purposes to facilitate trading to reduce transaction costs or to seek higher investment returns where an equity equivalent is priced more attractively than securities in the underlying index because the expense associated with an investment in equity equivalents may be substantially lower than the expense of small investments directly in the securities comprising the indices they seek to track investments in equity equivalents may provide a costeffective means of diversifying the funds assets across a broad range of equity securities to the extent a fund invests in securities of other investment companies fund shareholders would indirectly pay a portion of the operating costs of such companies in addition to the expenses of its own operation these costs include management brokerage shareholder servicing and other operational expenses indirectly then shareholders of a fund that invests in equity equivalents may pay higher operational costs than if they owned the underlying investment companies directly additionally the funds investments in such investment companies are subject to limitations under the  act and market availability the prices of equity equivalents are derived and based upon the securities held by the particular investment company accordingly the level of risk involved in the purchase or sale of an equity equivalent is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common stock with the exception that the pricing mechanism for such instruments is based on a basket of stocks the market prices of equity equivalents are expected to fluctuate in accordance with both changes in the net asset values of their underlying indices and the supply and demand for the instruments on the exchanges on which they are traded substantial market or other disruptions affecting an equity equivalent could adversely affect the liquidity and value of the shares of the fund investing in such instruments lending of portfolio securities the fund may lend portfolio securities to  brokers dealers and other financial organizations that meet capital and other credit requirements or other criteria established by the board these loans if and when made may not exceed  of the funds total assets taken at value the fund will not lend portfolio securities to affiliates of the adviser unless they have applied for and received specific authority to do so from the sec loans of portfolio securities will be collateralized by cash letters of credit or us government securities which are maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least  of the current market value of the loaned securities any gain or loss in the market price of the securities loaned that might occur during the term of the loan would be for the account of the fund from time to time the fund may return a part of the interest earned from the investment of collateral received for securities loaned to the borrower andor a third party that is unaffiliated with the fund and that is acting as a finder by lending its securities the fund can increase its income by continuing to receive interest and any dividends on the loaned securities as well as by either investing the collateral received for securities loaned in shortterm instruments or obtaining yield in the form of interest paid by the borrower when us government securities are used as collateral although the generation of income is not the primary investment goal of the funds income received could be used to pay the funds expenses and would increase an investors total return the fund will adhere to the following conditions whenever its portfolio securities are loaned i the fund must receive at least  cash collateral or equivalent securities of the type discussed in the preceding paragraph from the borrower ii the borrower must increase such collateral whenever a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th the market value of the securities rises above the level of such collateral iii the fund must be able to terminate the loan at any time iv the fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan as well as any dividends interest or other distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in market value v the fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in connection with the loan and vi voting rights on the loaned securities may pass to the borrower provided however that if a material event adversely affecting the investment occurs the board must terminate the loan and regain the right to vote the securities loan agreements involve certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the other party including possible delays or restrictions upon the funds ability to recover the loaned securities or dispose of the collateral for the loan whenissued securities delayeddelivery transactions and forward  commitments the fund may purchase securities on a whenissued basis for  delayed delivery ie payment or delivery occur beyond the normal settlement date at a stated price and yield or on a forward commitment basis the fund does not intend to engage in these transactions for speculative purposes but only in furtherance of its investment goal these transactions occur when securities are purchased or sold by the fund with payment and delivery taking place in the future to secure what is considered an advantageous yield and price to the fund at the time of entering into the transaction the payment obligation and the interest rate that will be received on whenissued securities are fixed at the time the buyer enters into the commitment due to fluctuations in the value of securities purchased or sold on a whenissued delayeddelivery basis or forward commitment basis the prices obtained on such securities may be higher or lower than the prices available in the market on the dates when the investments are actually delivered to the buyers when the fund agrees to purchase whenissued delayeddelivery securities or securities on a forward commitment basis its custodian will set aside cash or liquid securities equal to the amount of the commitment in a segregated account normally the custodian will set aside portfolio securities to satisfy a purchase commitment and in such a case the fund may be required subsequently to place additional assets in the segregated account in order to ensure that the value of the account remains equal to the amount of the funds commitment the assets contained in the segregated account will be markedtomarket daily it may be expected that the funds net assets will fluctuate to a greater degree when it sets aside portfolio securities to cover such purchase commitments than when it sets aside cash when the fund engages in whenissued delayeddelivery or forward commitment transactions it relies on the other party to consummate the trade failure of the seller to do so may result in the funds incurring a loss or missing an opportunity to obtain a price considered being advantageous repurchase agreements the fund may agree to purchase securities from a  bank or recognized securities dealer and simultaneously commit to resell the securities to the bank or dealer at an agreedupon date and price reflecting a market rate of interest unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased securities repurchase agreements the fund would maintain custody of the underlying securities prior to their repurchase thus the obligation of the bank or dealer to pay the repurchase price on the date agreed to would be in effect secured by such securities if the value of such securities were less than the repurchase price plus interest the other party to the agreement would be required to provide additional collateral so that at all times the collateral is at least  of the repurchase price plus accrued interest default by or bankruptcy of a seller would expose the fund to possible loss because of adverse market action expenses andor delays in connection with the disposition of the underlying obligations the a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th financial institutions with which the fund may enter into repurchase agreements will be banks and nonbank dealers of us government securities that are listed on the federal reserve bank of new yorks list of reporting dealers if such banks and nonbank dealers are deemed creditworthy by the funds adviser the adviser will continue to monitor creditworthiness of the seller under a repurchase agreement and will require the seller to maintain during the term of the agreement the value of the securities subject to the agreement to equal at least  of the repurchase price including accrued interest in addition the adviser will require that the value of this collateral after transaction costs including loss of interest reasonably expected to be incurred on a default be equal to  or greater than the repurchase price including accrued premium provided in the repurchase agreement or the daily amortization of the difference between the purchase price and the repurchase price specified in the repurchase agreement the adviser will marktomarket daily the value of the securities repurchase agreements are considered to be loans by the fund under the  act reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls the fund may enter into  reverse repurchase agreements with the same parties with whom it may enter into repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of securities held by the fund pursuant to its agreement to repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date price and rate of interest at the time the fund enters into a reverse repurchase agreement it will establish and maintain a segregated account with an approved custodian containing cash or liquid securities having a value not less than the repurchase price including accrued interest the assets contained in the segregated account will be markedtomarket daily and additional assets will be placed in such account on any day in which the assets fall below the repurchase price plus accrued interest the funds liquidity and ability to manage its assets might be affected when it sets aside cash or portfolio securities to cover such commitments reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities retained in lieu of sale may decline below the price of the securities the fund has sold but is obligated to repurchase in the event the buyer of securities under a reverse repurchase agreement files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent such buyer or its trustee or receiver may receive an extension of time to determine whether to enforce the funds obligation to repurchase the securities and the funds use of the proceeds of the reverse repurchase agreement may effectively be restricted pending such decision the fund also may enter into dollar rolls in which the fund sells fixedincome securities for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts to repurchase similar but not identical same type coupon and maturity securities on a specified future date during the roll period the fund would forego principal and interest paid on such securities the fund would be compensated by the difference between the current sales price and the forward price for the future purchase as well as by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the initial sale at the time the fund enters into a dollar roll transaction it will place in a segregated account maintained with an approved custodian cash or liquid securities having a value not less than the repurchase price including accrued interest and will subsequently monitor the account to ensure that its value is maintained reverse repurchase agreements and dollar rolls that are accounted for as financings are considered to be borrowings under the  act convertible securities convertible securities in which the fund may  invest including both convertible debt and convertible preferred stock may be converted at either a stated price or a paposth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th stated rate into underlying shares of common stock because of this feature convertible securities enable an investor to benefit from increases in the market price of the underlying common stock convertible securities provide higher yields than the underlying equity securities but generally offer lower yields than nonconvertible securities of similar quality like bonds the value of convertible securities fluctuates in relation to changes in interest rates and in addition also fluctuates in relation to the underlying common stock structured notes the fund may invest in structured notes the  distinguishing feature of a structured note is that the amount of interest andor principal payable on the notes is based on the performance of a benchmark asset or market other than fixedincome securities or interest rates examples of a benchmark include stock prices currency exchange rates and physical commodity prices investing in a structured note allows the fund to gain exposure to the benchmark asset or market such as investments in certain emerging markets that restrict investment by foreigners the structured note fixes the maximum loss that the fund may experience in the event that the market does not perform as expected the performance tie can be a straight relationship or leveraged although the adviser generally will not use leverage in its structured note strategies depending on the terms of the note the fund may forego all or part of the interest and principal that would be payable on a comparable conventional note the funds loss cannot exceed this foregone interest andor principal an investment in a structured note involves risks similar to those associated with a direct investment in the benchmark asset structured notes will be treated as illiquid securities for investment limitation purposes nonpublicly traded and illiquid securities the fund may not invest more  than  of its net assets in nonpublicly traded and illiquid securities including securities that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market repurchase agreements which have a maturity of longer than seven days certain rule a securities as described below and time deposits maturing in more than seven days securities that have legal or contractual restrictions on resale but have a readily available market are not considered illiquid for purposes of this limitation repurchase agreements subject to demand are deemed to have a maturity equal to the notice period under current guidelines of the staff of the sec illiquid securities are considered to include among other securities purchased otc options certain cover for otc options securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale because they have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended the securities act securities which are otherwise not readily marketable and repurchase agreements having a maturity of longer than seven days securities which have not been registered under the securities act are referred to as private placements or restricted securities and are purchased directly from the issuer or in the secondary market limitations on resale may have an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities and a mutual fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid securities promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty satisfying redemptions within seven days without borrowing a mutual fund might also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them resulting in additional expense and delay adverse market conditions could impede such a public offering of securities in recent

and the mechanics of the transfer emerging growth and smaller capitalization companies unseasoned issuers  investments in securities of small and mediumsized emerging growth companies and companies with continuous operations of less than three years unseasoned issuers involve considerations that are not applicable to investing in securities of established largercapitalization issuers including reduced and less reliable information about issuers and markets less stringent financial disclosure requirements illiquidity of securities and markets higher brokerage commissions and fees and greater market risk in general securities of these companies may also involve greater risks since these securities may have limited marketability and thus may be more volatile because such companies normally have fewer shares outstanding than larger more established companies it may be more difficult for the fund to buy or sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing prices these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources and may lack management depth in addition these companies are typically subject to a greater degree of changes in earnings and business prospects than are larger more established companies although investing in securities of these companies offers potential for aboveaverage returns if the companies are successful the risk exists that the companies will not succeed and the prices of the companies shares could significantly decline in value rights offerings and purchase warrants the fund may invest in rights and

price for the stock index option when the market closes at  pm eastern time then the stock index option will be valued at the mean between the bid and asked quotations a security which is listed or traded on more than one exchange is valued at the quotation on the exchange determined to be the primary market for such security shortterm obligations with maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which constitutes fair value as determined by the board amortized cost involves valuing a portfolio instrument at its initial cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market value of the instrument the amortized cost method of valuation may also be used with respect to other debt obligations with  days or less remaining to maturity notwithstanding the foregoing in determining the market value of portfolio investments the fund may employ outside organizations a price service which may use a matrix formula or other objective method that takes into consideration market indexes matrices yield curves and other specific adjustments the procedures of pricing services are reviewed periodically by the officers of the fund under the general supervision and responsibility of the board which may replace a pricing service at any time securities options and futures contracts for which market quotations are not available and certain other assets of the fund will be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to consistently applied procedures

execution will be obtained the purchase price paid by the fund to underwriters of newly issued securities usually includes a concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter and purchases of securities from dealers acting as either principals or agents in the after market are normally executed at a price between the bid and asked price which includes a dealers markup or markdown

may vary among different brokers on most foreign exchanges commissions are generally fixed there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in domestic or foreign

additional information concerning taxes the following is a summary of the material united states federal income tax considerations regarding the purchase ownership and disposition of shares of the fund each prospective shareholder is urged to consult his own tax adviser with respect to the specific federal state local and foreign tax consequences of investing in the fund the summary is based on the laws in effect on the date of this sai which are subject to change the fund and its investments  the fund intends to qualify to be treated as a regulated investment company each taxable year under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code to so qualify the fund must among other things a derive at least  of its gross income in each taxable year from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures or forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and b diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the funds taxable year i at least  of the market value of the funds assets is represented by cash securities of other regulated investment companies united states government securities and other securities with such other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount not greater than  of the funds assets and not greater than  of the a paposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its assets is invested in the securities other than united states government securities or securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or any two or more issuers that the fund controls and are determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related trades or businesses as a regulated investment company the fund will not be subject to united states federal income tax on its investment company taxable income ie income other than any excess of its net realized longterm capital gains over its net realized shortterm capital losses netrealized capital gains and on its net realized capital gains if any that it distributes to its shareholders provided that an amount equal to at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income plus or minus certain other adjustments as specified in the code and its net taxexempt income for the taxable year is distributed but will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains that it does not distribute furthermore the fund will be subject to a united states corporate income tax with respect to such distributed amounts in any year that it fails to qualify as a regulated investment company or fails to meet this distribution requirement the code imposes a  nondeductible excise tax on the fund to the extent the fund does not distribute by the end of any calendar year at least  of its net investment income and  of the net amount of its capital gains both longterm and shortterm for the oneyear period ending as a general rule on october  of that year for this purpose however any income or gain retained by the fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have been distributed by yearend in addition the minimum amounts that must be distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution as the case may be from the previous year the fund anticipates that it will pay such dividends and will make such distributions as are necessary in order to avoid the application of this tax with regard to the funds investments in foreign securities exchange control regulations may restrict repatriations of investment income and capital or the proceeds of securities sales by foreign investors such as the fund and may limit the funds ability to pay sufficient dividends and to make sufficient distributions to satisfy the  and excise tax distribution requirements if in any taxable year the fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company under the code or fails to meet the distribution requirement it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the fund in computing its taxable income in addition in the event of a failure to qualify the funds distributions to the extent derived from the funds current or accumulated earnings and profits would constitute dividends eligible for the corporate dividendsreceived deduction which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income even though those distributions might otherwise at least in part have been treated in the shareholders hands as longterm capital gains if the fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company in any year it must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to qualify again as a regulated investment company in addition if the fund failed to qualify as a regulated investment company for a period greater than one taxable year the fund may be required to recognize any net builtin gains with respect to certain of its assets the excess of the aggregate gains including items of income over a paposrd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd aggregate losses that would have been realized if the fund had been liquidated in order to qualify as a regulated investment company in a subsequent year the funds transactions in foreign currencies forward contracts options and futures contracts including options and futures contracts on foreign currencies will be subject to special provisions of the code including provisions relating to hedging transactions and straddles that among other things may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the fund ie may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital accelerate recognition of income to the fund and defer fund losses these rules could therefore affect the character amount and timing of distributions to shareholders these provisions also a will require the fund to marktomarket certain types of the positions in its portfolio ie treat them as if they were closed out and b may cause the fund to recognize income without receiving cash with which to pay dividends or make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes the fund will monitor its transactions will make the appropriate tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in its books and records when it acquires any foreign currency forward contract option futures contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the fund as a regulated investment company the funds investment in section  contracts such as regulated futures contracts most forward currency forward contracts traded in the interbank market and options on most stock indices are subject to special tax rules all section  contracts held by the fund at the end of its taxable year are required to be marked to their market value and any unrealized gain or loss on those positions will be included in the funds income as if each position had been sold for its fair market value at the end of the taxable year the resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by the fund from positions in section  contracts closed during the

characteristics are denoted with a plus sign designation capacity for timely payment on commercial paper rated a is satisfactory but the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated a the rating prime is the highest commercial paper rating assigned by moodys issuers rated prime or related supporting institutions are considered to have a superior capacity for repayment of shortterm promissory obligations issuers rated prime or related supporting institutions are considered to have a strong capacity for repayment of shortterm promissory obligations this will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics of issuers rated prime but to a lesser degree earnings trends and coverage ratios while sound will be more subject to variation capitalization characteristics while still appropriate may be more affected by external conditions ample alternative liquidity is maintained corporate bond ratings  the following summarizes the ratings used by sp for corporate bonds aaa  this is the highest rating assigned by sp to a debt obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal aa  debt rated aa has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differs from aaa issues only in small degree a  debt rated a has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higherrated categories bbb  this is the lowest investment grade debt rated bbb is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher rated categories bb b and ccc  debt rated bb and b are regarded on balance as predominately speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation bb represents a lower degree of speculation than b and ccc the highest degree of speculation while such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions a paposst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st bb  debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments the bb rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bbb rating b  debt rated b has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating ccc  debt rated ccc has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal the ccc rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied b or b rating cc  this rating is typically applied to debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied ccc rating c  this rating is typically applied to debt subordinated to senior debt which is assigned an actual or implied ccc debt rating the c rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed but debt service payments are continued additionally the rating ci is reserved for income bonds on which no interest is being paid such debt is rated between debt rated c and debt rated d to provide more detailed indications of credit quality the ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within this major rating category d  debt rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless sp believes that such payments will be made during such grace period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized the following summarizes the ratings used by moodys for corporate bonds aaa  bonds that are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edged interest payments are protected by a large or exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa  bonds that are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated a paposnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities a  bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as uppermediumgrade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa  bonds which are rated baa are considered as mediumgrade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well ba  bonds which are rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class b  bonds which are rated b generally lack characteristics of desirable investments assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small moodys applies numerical modifiers   and  with respect to the bonds rated aa through b the modifier  indicates that the bond being rated ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the bond ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category caa  bonds that are rated caa are of poor standing these issues may be in default or present elements of danger may exist with respect to principal or interest ca  bonds which are rated ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings c  bonds which are rated c comprise the lowest rated class of bonds and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any real investment standing a
