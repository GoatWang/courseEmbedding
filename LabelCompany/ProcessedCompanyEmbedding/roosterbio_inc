announced the commercial launch of roostervialhbmm msc a single vial containing  million human bonemarrow derived mesenchymal stemstromal cells this unprecedented ultrahigh cell number product configuration enables regenerative medicine organizations to accelerate scaleup and product development activities roosterbio’s core technology which includes cell and media systems allows tissue engineers biofabricators d bioprinters and cell therapy developers to instantly scale up using simplified and standardized methods the  million hmsc vial delivers immediate cell biomass without the need for prior expansion this results in saving significant time resources and expense during bioprocess scaleup optimization since the system contains the most wellcharacterized hmscs available on the market the industry is assured robust and reproducible results as with other roosterbio products this  million cell product is capable of greater than fold expansion  billion cells within two weeks when cultured in roosterbio medium prior to this technology obtaining such cell numbers so rapidly was virtually impossible roosterbio continues to broaden their portfolio of product formats providing solutions for an extensive range of regenerative medicine therapeutic categories the evolving product portfolio enables researchers and product developers to perform small scale screening studies large scale development studies and now scaleup manufacturing bioprocess experiments using the  million cell product rapid prototyping of d bioprinted tissues utilizing hmscs as the primary component of the cellular “bioink” is also now achievable the company offers various product configurations including  million cell vials  million cell vials and high performance media systems as well as preassembled working cell banks and kits for rapidly achieving stem cell biomass jon rowley ceo of roosterbio stated the industry has published a technology roadmap for scalable cell manufacturing

roosterbio inc today announces the commercial launch of the industry’s first readytoprint rtp stem cell product designed specifically for bioprinters and tissue engineers removing weeks of time from the cellular bioprinting process the healthcare industry is trying to swiftly capitalize on additive manufacturing technologies also referred to as d printing whether developers are creating prosthetic limbs or using living cells to bioprint human tissues and organs experiments in this industry are progressing at a remarkable pace roosterbio’s  million cell rtp format is an unprecedented stem cell product configuration that provides significant quantities of high quality human mesenchymal stemstromal cells hmscs in a uniquely designed format to simplify and standardize the most complex and labor intensive aspects of bioprinting the most significant challenge in the advancement of d bioprinting is the scarce availability of living cellular biomaterials for printing roosterbio’s rtp product allows bioprinters and tissue engineers to thaw and use stem cells for same day experiments avoiding time labor and costintensive cell expansion processes by simply thawing and using hmscs scientists can minimize time between experiments for rapid experimental turnaround and publication furthermore the highly standardized starting cellular materials will minimize experimental variability this innovative product format allows users to take advantage of roosterbio’s economies of scale to obtain hmscs at a fraction of the cost of any other cell systems on the market this new product reinforces roosterbio’s commitment to engineering solutions which remove complexity from adult stem cell research and accelerate customers’ product development efforts roosterrtphbmm was unveiled at the tissue engineering and regenerative medicine international society termis world congress in boston ma from september   where the rapid development of the bioprinting industry was on full display erik gatenholm ceo of cellink stated “the d bioprinting field is one of the most innovative and rapidly developing scientific areas today d bioprinting can be explained through the utilization of three components namely a d bioprinter a bioink or hydrogel and human cells currently generating human cells is a significant bottleneck due to the time needed to culture expand cells for the bioprinting process with the roosterbio rtp stem cells this is no longer the case the cells can be thawed and used immediately now we can finally offer our customers complete
