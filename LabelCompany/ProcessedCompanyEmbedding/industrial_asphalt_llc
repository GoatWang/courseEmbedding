would definitely hire them again for any jobgood jobdid you knowhaving a paved driveway or parking lot has many benefits over gravel dirt and even concrete its neater looks better and doesnt turn to mud when it rains however a paved asphalt lot or driveway comes with maintenance requirements of its ownasphalt expands and contracts with the temperature and weather conditions this improves durability but over time its important to make sure the asphalt is still holding strongrepaving vs seal coatingthere are two common ways to maintain aging asphalt pavement many people opt for repavement but seal coating is also a good option each has its own advantages and disadvantagesrepavingrepaving your asphalt driveway or lot entails putting new asphalt down it can either be laid on top of the existing driveway or the current asphalt can be torn up and replaced if the asphalt has undergone major damage such as large cracks or is deteriorating from underneath due to groundwater erosion repaving might be the best course of action putting it off might only make the problem worsethe cost to rip up an old driveway remove the debris and lay down a new one is usually several thousand dollars with some jobs costing up to  depending on the scope of work and the home or business locationif your driveway is in fairly decent shape and you are performing simple preventative tasks to keep it strong for many more years repaving it completely probably isnt necessary repaving is a long and expensive process and only truly needs to be pursued when the driveway really is at the end of its life a good rule of thumb is if onequarter of the driveway or more needs to be repaired repaving is the way to go but if less than that is crumbling a seal coat would be sufficientseal coatingputting a seal on your asphalt driveway will help it resist water damage and can double its lifespan it will also protect against oil spills and pothole formation and helps ice and snow melt faster plus it shields the driveway from uv rays which can cause the asphalt to become brittlein addition to these benefits seal coating is typically a much less expensive process than repaving it generally costs a few hundred dollars in  the highest price was about  and the average homeowner paid less than  to seal coat their driveways every new asphalt driveway or parking lot should be seal coated but the process must be done at least  days after the asphalt was laid the optimal timeframe is between one and two years after the driveway is laidtypes of asphaltit can be difficult to tell the difference between one paved lot and another but when choosing an asphalt type for your driveway or parking lot there are a range of optionshot mix asphalt hmahma is the most common type used for driveways numerous benefits are associated with this style includinghigh durabilitylow maintenancepolished lookresistance to salt commonly used to prevent ice formation during the winterable to withstand multiple freezes and thawseasy to repair when neededperpetual pavementperpetual pavement is generally used for roads and consists of three layersthe bottom layer is strong flexible and resists deterioration either extrathick or highly flexible hma is typically used for this layer to improve durability its usually between  and  inches thickthe middle layer is strong and sturdy as it will support the weight of the cars coarse aggregates combined with a binder are generally used to add durability and rut resistance this layer is typically between  and  inches thickthe top layer is meant to be the driving surface its usually a highquality hma thats  to  inches thick this layer is designed to combat rutting and stress crackingroads made of perpetual pavement have their top layer torn up and replaced every few years but the bottom and middle layers are meant to be permanentquiet or stone matrix asphaltstone matrix asphalt has several qualities that make it perfect for highways with heavy traffic volume using this type can reduce noise pollution by as much as  percent which makes it ideal for travelers on long road trips or anyone who lives near a highway its also highly durable and very resistant to rutting however its also significantly more expensive than other options so it isnt often used for driveways parking lots or even smaller roadsporous asphaltporous asphalt is usually laid on top of a recharge bed that rainwater can drain into through the pavement its a common choice in parking lots to prevent surface flooding and can also help improve groundwater qualitycommon uses of asphaltasphalt is highly versatile very durable and fairly affordable for many people its primarily used for road surfaces  percent of us roads are made of asphalt other uses includedrivewaysparking lotstennis or basketball courtsracetracksairport runwaysquestions to ask when choosing a paving contractorwhile your driveway or parking lot certainly isnt what makes you or your home or business great it is a contributing factor to peoples first impressions bad pavement jobs can result in pooling rainwater and premature cracking so you need to choose a paving contractor who can deliver a durable professionallooking surface before deciding on a contractor hold a few interviews to determine which company is best for your jobare you insuredany time you hire a contractor to complete a project at your home you should doublecheck to make sure the company is insured liability and workers compensation are good starts but having an umbrella policy and auto liability are also idealis your asphalt recycledmost asphalt is partially made of recycled material some people prefer recycled asphalt because its more environmentally friendly than new asphalt however too much older material in your new driveway can make it look worn down and decrease its lifespan be sure to inquire about the ratio of new to recycled asphaltwhat type of equipment do you useasphalt needs to be laid quickly and efficiently to ensure it looks nice asphalt that begins to cool before the rest of the job is done will end up sloppy if your contractor uses outdated equipment that is prone to breakdowns youre taking the risk that this situation will occurif the contractor responds to this question by saying he or she can pave an asphalt driveway by hand consider looking for another contractor he or she might be highly skilled at handpaving but a machine will generally do a better job that will look nicer and last longerhow much will it costof course youll want to get a quote during your contractor interviews one red flag is being asked for a down payment the typical asphalt paving job shouldnt require a down paymentif the quote sounds too high ask what is included the size of the job will make a difference as well as necessary materials if your driveway or parking lot needs to be leveled out or if there are drainage issues present your quote might begin to creep higher talk about the grade of asphalt and any challenges your job requires  these could increase the coston the other hand if a quote seems unrealistically low find out why perhaps their equipment is outdated or their asphalt is low quality worse is the possibility that there are hidden fees you didnt discuss during the initial conversationdo you have references i can callspeaking to people who have worked with this contractor before is one of the best ways to get a feel for how they work with clients you can also search online to see if anyone has reviewed the company on sites like ypcomadditionally ask if there are any nearby examples of the companys work you can see perhaps theyve done parking lots you drive by every dayhow many people will work on my projectideally your contractor will have a crew of between five and eight people too few will make the job challenging which could result in a poorly laid drivewaycommon issues and hazardswhen asphalt gets old or if the wrong type of asphalt was used for a particular job certain types of defects can begin to showalligator cracks and potholesthese are scalylooking cracks that run throughout a portion of a road they are caused when the asphalt wasnt provided enough support or drainage over time they can deteriorate until they become potholesprevent alligator cracks by making sure the base layer is strong enough if you begin to notice alligator cracks or potholes only a fulldepth patch can remedy themlongitudinal transverse and joint reflection cracksjoints are usually the weakest part of a paving job and inadequate joint construction can eventually lead to crackslongitudinal cracks are parallel to the roads centerline or the direction the driveway or parking lot was paved they are usually caused by poor joint construction or simply aging pavementtransverse cracks run perpendicular to the roads centerline and can be caused by poor joint construction as well seasonal or daily temperature changes can also contribute to transverse cracksjoint reflection cracks occur on asphalt surfaces that are laid over concrete surfacesbird baths edge cracks and ruttingthese issues are usually seen on the sides of roads bird baths or depressions are caused when the pavement isnt as deep in one area or the land on which the road was laid is uneven a slight depression can be fixed with another layer of asphaltedge cracks are generally caused by weak edges when there isnt enough support at the edge the road will begin to stress and crack over timerutting occurs in the wheel tracks of a road and is
