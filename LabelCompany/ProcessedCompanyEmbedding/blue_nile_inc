able to purchase the ring for an excellent price he has realized the unlimited potential which online jewelry markets carried the internet diamonds portal was the tool of vadon’s business success by the end of the s vadon has gathered  million in funds and was willing to purchase internet diamonds with the aim to transform it into a new userfriendly internet business funding universe  in may  he renamed internet diamonds into “blue nile” which was followed by massive print and television advertising campaign funding universe  by using television and print media blue nile was actually shaping the new layer of customers who would not be afraid of making expensive purchases online and would seek easy and costeffective purchasing solutions at the beginning of the new millennium when dozens of companies were fighting to preserve their online market niches blue nile inc was still flourishing being able to follow the increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and expanding the range of jewelry products “to attract customers who would not spend thousands for jewelry” funding universe  the items which were considered irrelevant by conventional retailers attracted thousands of women to blue nile turning the company into the leading online supplier of jewelry vadon has also realized the role which education and knowledge could play in the development and expansion of his business he tried to combine customer education with advertising that an educated customer would be more likely to make a purchase from blue nile vadon was confident as a result the subsection “education” has become the essential feature of the blue nile’s website offering extensive and comprehensive information about all major kinds of jewelry blue nile a blue nile was the first to explain complicated professional terms by using the language which was understandable to common consumers making them aware of the best features and peculiarities of blue nile’s products now blue nile inc is a wellestablished brand name which consumers associate with high quality customer service fast delivery and userfriendly interface “every order is shipped free guaranteed and returnable within  days so you can be sure you made the right decision” blue nile a regardless the difficulties which the company faced on its way to excellence and despite the growing popularity of online jewelry products blue nile should not neglect the opportunities and threats which currently characterize the online jewelry market in this context a detailed swot analysis may help identify and address the major market complexities strengths wellestablished brand name welldeveloped selling strategy high quality customer service broad range of jewelry products weaknesses low profit margins lowcost approach to sales opportunities developing actual network of retail outlets the increasingly sophisticated consumer needs the growing range of jewelry products in the market threats economic crisis in the u s the growing market competition the growing number of jewelry retailers cheaper counterfeit goods it should be noted that even under the pressure of the growing economic crisis blue nile has succeeded to keep its market niche to expand its presence in the online markets and to expand the range of its products however the lowcost selling strategy to which blue nile adheres “instead of trying to push our gross margins as high as possible we sell as cheap as we possibly can” – funding universe  may not work to promote the company’s profitability in the long run the company’s net sales for the fourth quarter  have fallen to   million as compared to   million in the fourth quarter of  blue nile b given the company’s wellestablished brand name the availability of material and nonmaterial resources as well as the growing variety of jewelry goods in the market blue nile can readily expand the range of its products to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer needs and by expanding its network of actual retail outlets the company will be able to target the customers who prefer making real time purchases certainly blue nile should not neglect the worsening economic situation in the u s  moreover the jewelry market has always been characterized by high counterfeit product risks the growing number of competitors may also threaten blue nile’s market position ashford com diamonds com tiffany  co  and zale corporation are fighting to expand their shares of market and may challenge stable market position of blue nile funding universe  nevertheless the company’s emphasis on knowledge and customer awareness as well as its openness to new products and services will help blue nile cope with the growing market challenges and maintain costeffectiveness of its business operations in longterm periods conclusion blue nile was started as the natural desire to improve the level of customer satisfaction in online jewelry markets with time the company has turned into the leading online supplier of jewelry products the company’s stability is threatened by the growing economic crisis and the constantly increasing market competition but given a wellestablished brand name reputation customer loyalty and the growing range of jewelry products blue nile is likely to retain its market position in the long run references blue nile a about us blue nile inc retrieved march   from

students since     todays opening times    bst marketing reference this apa mla mla harvard vancouver wikipedia  words chapters line spacing single double overview of blue nile inc marketing essay published rd march  last edited rd march  this essay has been submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers generic strategies can be defined as fundamental approaches to strategic planning adopted by companies or organizations in any market or industry in an effort to improve its competitive performance porter  blue nile inc has adapted two fundamental generic strategies which include focus strategy and differentiation strategy combining business model together with these strategies determines blue nile incs position in the jewelry market porter  the company has adopted the differentiation strategy in that it has made an effort to develop as well as market unique products for different clientele segments porter  further being an online retailer of unique and rare diamonds and gemstones blue nile inc offers shoppers useful information as concerns the different products and services they may desire this is the best strategy the company can adopt since it has very few or in other cases no competitors thus enjoying competitive advantages managing to sustain expensive advertising campaigns ibid  on the other hand focus strategy is whereby a company or organization concentrates its resources on expanding or attempting to enter in a narrow industry or market segment porter  blue nile inc has employed this form of strategy as it is aware of its segment and has products capable of satisfying its needs competitively by going online the company focuses on smaller specific niche of clients as compared to focusing on segments across the entire market porter  financial and strategic performance indicators performance indicators can be defined as a measure of an organizations or companys performance these measures are used to assist the firm in defining and evaluating how successful it is as well as how much progress it is making towards its long term organizational objectives porter  to measure its financial and strategic performance blue nile inc largely focuses on competitive pricing efficient and economical supply chain as well as lean cost this is favored by the fact that it has established a unique online approach and designed a website displaying the numerous distinct diamonds and gemstones they offer to their clients ibid  owing to its welldesigned website and lack of physical shops the company is able to cut a great deal of costs from its operations enabling customers to enjoy reduced jewelry prices in addition due to holding numerous advertising campaigns both off and online majority of the clients are able to visit blue nile incs website creating an advantage for the company as it increases product awareness to customers porter  by using the website blue nile inc is also able to reach its target market in order to sell their products the cost of advertising had gone up in the past and this had forced the company to pull out from advertising through their website to compensate for this they ensured that its jewelry consultants were efficiently trained so as to give the clients quality information as regards the products during sale of their products porter  as a result the company being in a position to fulfill its orders operations designed to suit their individual needs increased clients confidence and value the main performance indicators for blue nile inc were customer support and service held in high regard by the company it believed in the purchasing power of its clients that needs to be respected at all times porter  product line expansion was observed as the last performance indicator for the company blue nile inc was in a better position to calculate clients response and opinions as concerns new products in the market before they could actually be introduced since it could show case and sell jewelry still stocked by suppliers porter  another financial and strategy performance indicator for blue nile inc is that of internal motivation provision of stock options to nonemployee directors officers and employees were instituted in the stockbased compensation plans by the company ibid  the company used a supply chain considered the better option being offered by traditional distributors and wholesalers of diamond the companys equity in the jewelry market is enhanced through its online business model since it incurs minimal expenses as regards its operations in the process of carrying out its business activities and transactions porter  offering the customers reduced product prices increase their loyalty in the products and services offered by blue nile inc placing the company in a favorable position in the market as compared to those running mortar and brick establishments ibid  strategy performance indicators of blue nile inc are also determined by provision of excellent and effective communication mechanisms focusing on the need to provide the client with information they would need to carry out online transactions porter  therefore supply chain ought to be faultless in order to encourage timely delivery of products once a client has completed the purchasing process financial and strategy performance indicators success is determined by the popularity of its products and services as indicated in the financial statements porter  recommendations blue nile inc should consider presence of physical stores in addition to having an online shop within specific high ends market as this would contribute to the enhancement of distribution network of the jewelry porter  the company should also be aware of the stiff competition the current jewelry market is facing as new and upcoming businesses venturing into this kind of business are rapidly emerging as the population grows the company or the ceo can thus decide to formulate its niche in the jewelry market through specialization of specific and chosen jewelry ibid  this would in turn enable the company to take as much advantage of the economies of scale as possible by doing this it will also colonize the jewelry market for the particular jewelry porter  specializing on a particular kind of diamond or gemstone the quality is bound to improve surviving any potential threat of competition the company should consider maintaining a given line of product andor service in order to ensure sustainability through quality despite the companys ceo claiming that blue nile is comfortable being a monopoly in a fine collection of highquality diamond porter  conclusion it has been observed that online business model offers blue nile inc some form of competitive advantage as regards its equity in the jewelry market by including costs as part of sga expenses blue nile inc drastically reduces financial burden to their clients and are thus in a position to expand its product line offering a wide range of jewelry having differentiated pricing request removal if you are the original writer of this essay and no longer wish to have the
