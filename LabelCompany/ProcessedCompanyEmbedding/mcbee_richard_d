telecommunications read full bio  share cc dave michels  august      tweet   share   q and a mitel ceo rich mcbee q and a mitel ceo rich mcbee a wideranging discussion includes cloud and virtualization strategies gotomarket economic trends and possible further acquisitions a wideranging discussion includes cloud and virtualization strategies gotomarket economic trends and possible further acquisitions in january  rich mcbee became the ceo of mitel it seemed like an odd career choice the stock had lost more than half its value in the past seven months just a few months earlier the prior ceo was honored as ceo of the year by the ottawa business journal the prior month december  mitel missed its q numbers causing analysts to downgrade the stock and microsoft launched its competitive lync  solution mcbee would be joining the mitel board which included company founder and wellestablished entrepreneur sir terry matthews as well as venture capital investors mcbee a year it and telecommunications veteran left his position as president of the communications  enterprise group of danaher corp where he managed revenue of more than  million he had become an employee of danaher when it acquired tektronix in  mcbee had been hired into tektronix product marketing and over his year term had worked his way up to general manager prior to joining the private sector mcbee was in the air force having graduated from the air force academy with a bachelor of science in  he later received a masters degree in business administration from the chapman school of business and economics although mitel is headquartered in ottawa mcbee has set up shop in dallas and now several other executives are based out of the texas office he has an yearold daughter and yearold son who keep him mobile including coaching youth football he enjoys the outdoors and mcbee and his wife alisha are both master fly anglers mcbee describes himself as a technology early adopter with an extensive collection of computer and electronic gadgets he also considers himself highly competitive when it comes to his views on the industry our conversation went like this dm as a telecom veteran thats new to our industry what has surprised you the most about the enterprise uc segment rm one of the biggest surprises for me was how many old systems are out there im a technology gadget kind of guy i havent counted recently but i probably have a doubledigit number of personal devices on or near me at any given time and i want to upgrade as soon as the beta is available but for many of our customers it takes them a long time to adopt new technology there are always those customers who want it yesterday but most are extremely thoughtful and realize the decision they are making they will live with for a decade or more theres a light bulb moment when you realize that our industry is not about technology its about what a technology investment can do to drive growth revenue productivity and process improvements for a business thats the same way mitel runs we look at every dollar we spendand ill admit weve got some museumworthy systems in our company not our uc that probably should be upgraded but at some point good enough is good enough if it gets the job done my litmus test for spending on new systems isdo they have customer impact and will they generate growth if so they get spending priority its the same for our customers dm your first external message as ceo was that mitel wont compete with its channel yet mitel still directly sells both products and its cloud services also mitels cloud services compete with service providers using mitel technology can you clarify your gotomarket approach rm i made it clear out of the gate that mitel needed to align with our channel and as a result we have made big changes to move the majority of our direct accounts to our channel partners we were also clear that there would be house accounts namely certain accounts that we sell direct to and those accounts that have complex financial leasing programs where it doesnt make sense to transition them to the channel i make no apologies for that that number is capped and will remain capped and frankly i havent heard many if any channels confused or complaining about our approach there with respect to competing in or for the cloud i think thats a redherring created by the overly analytical everybody is seeing a portion of their business go to cloud if you arent thinking about it youre going to be left behind quickly mitel has been a clec for years which is an advantage not a threat for our channel truth is many of our most progressive and ambitious service provider partners are actively planning or evaluating how to offer their own cloud services powered by mitel that we can play both offense and defense is a huge competitive advantage for mitel and for our partners dm mitel has been very aggressive with virtualization a bit ahead of the market its a lot of change for an established channel network how do you encourage your partners to keep up rm simple ageold business  principlefollow the money mitel channel partners who lead with virtualization enjoy a greater than  annual growth rate in their mitel business more than double the industry average those who dont leverage virtualization are declining at the exact same rate thats not because of anything were doingits because that is what the market is looking for end customers are calling the play for our partners and they are increasingly asking about virtualization the interesting part is that customers who give us the full drill on cloud or virtualization are as likely to go with an onpremise solution as they are to adopt a cloud solution but they want to know how theyre going to get to the cloud once they are ready to make the transition and whether or not mitel and our channel can take them there when i got to mitel i was really surprised by the longevity of our channelin some cases stretching back to the founding of our company  years ago we value our partners and the people we work with and we know that a change in our business or offering has a direct impact on whether they remain in business thats a big responsibility so we do everything that we can to get partners up to speed and current through our certification program make no mistake about it though to compete and win i need partners that are premise experts cloud experts and virtualization specialists all at the same timeand our partners need that too doesnt matter how big or small you areits a hard truth for all businesses that if youre not growing youre dying if youre a vendor or an smb channel and youre not adapting to that market change your competitors are going to send you to the wood chopper dm the industry has gone through some big revolutions tdm to voip to uc mobility and cloud what do you see as the next big transition rm at the risk of sounding simple simplification is the next big transition for our industry making what weve got really work seamlessly the truth is as an industry were not there yet im less interested in chasing theoretical technical rainbows and more interested in simplifying how customers deal in reality we can try to predict and guess what the next big technology wave will be all we want but the only true barometer that accurately gets it right each time is customer demand so we follow the customer mitels vision is to enable our customers to communicate and collaborate anywhere over any medium with the device of their choice and were passionate about trying to make that seamless which is easy to say but very hard to do pants first then shoes next page acquisitionsprairiefyre and lastpage  of  comments trending now mobile messaging  be in their
