united states petitioner v john h williams jr decision cites  us   sct   ledd  united states petitioner v john h williams jr no  argued jan   decided may   opinion scalia html dissent stevens blackmun oconnor thomas html syllabus respondent williams was indicted by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of  usc  on his motion the district court ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice because the government had failed to fulfill its obligation under circuit precedent to present substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury following that precedent the court of appeals affirmed held  the argument that the petition should be dismissed as improvidently granted because the question presented was not raised below was considered and rejected when this court granted certiorari and is rejected again here the court will not review a question that was neither pressed nor passed on below see eg stevens v department of treasury  us    sct    ledd  but there is no doubt that the court of appeals passed on the crucial issue of the prosecutors duty to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury it is appropriate to review an important issue expressly decided by a federal court where as here although the petitioner did not contest the issue in the case immediately at hand it did so as a party to the recent proceeding upon which the lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue and did not concede in the current case the correctness of that precedent pp  a district court may not dismiss an otherwise valid indictment because the government failed to disclose to the grand jury substantial exculpatory evidence in its possession pp  a imposition of the court of appeals disclosure rule is not supported by the courts inherent supervisory power to formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the constitution or the congress this courts cases relying upon that power deal strictly with the courts control over their own procedures whereas the grand jury is an institution separate from the courts over whose functioning the courts do not preside any power federal courts may have to fashion on their own initiative rules of grand jury procedure is very limited and certainly would not permit the reshaping of the grand jury institution that would be the consequence of the proposed rule here pp  b the court of appeals rule would neither preserve nor enhance the traditional functioning of the grand jury that the common law of the fifth amendment demands to the contrary requiring the prosecutor to present exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter the grand jurys historical role transforming it from an accusatory body that sits to assess whether there is adequate basis for bringing a criminal charge into an adjudicatory body that sits to determine guilt or innocence because it has always been thought sufficient for the grand jury to hear only the prosecutors side and consequently that the suspect has no right to present and the grand jury no obligation to consider exculpatory evidence it would be incompatible with the traditional system to impose upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to present such evidence moreover motions to quash indictments based upon the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury have never been allowed and it would make little sense to abstain from reviewing the evidentiary support for the grand jurys judgment while scrutinizing the sufficiency of the prosecutors presentation pp  c this court need not pursue respondents argument that the court of appeals rule would save valuable judicial time if there is any advantage to the proposal congress is free to prescribe it p   fd  ca  reversed and remanded scalia j delivered the opinion of the court in which rehnquist cj and white kennedy and souter jj joined stevens j filed a dissenting opinion in which blackmun and oconnor jj joined and in parts ii and iii of which thomas j joined solicitor gen kenneth w starr for petitioner james c lang tulsa okl for respondent top justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court the question presented in this case is whether a district court may dismiss an otherwise valid indictment because the government failed to disclose to the grand jury substantial exculpatory evidence in its possession  on may   respondent john h williams jr a tulsa oklahoma investor was indicted by a federal grand jury on seven counts of knowingly making a false statement or report    for the purpose of influencing    the action of a federally insured financial institution in violation of  usc   ed supp ii according to the indictment between september  and november  williams supplied four oklahoma banks with materially false statements that variously overstated the value of his current assets and interest income in order to influence the banks actions on his loan requests williams misrepresentation was allegedly effected through two financial statements provided to the banks a market value balance sheet and a statement of projected income and expense the former included as current assets approximately  million in notes receivable from three venture capital companies though it contained a disclaimer that these assets were carried at cost rather than at market value the government asserted that listing them as current assetsie assets quickly reducible to cash was misleading since williams knew that none of the venture capital companies could afford to satisfy the notes in the short term the second documentthe statement of projected income and expenseallegedly misrepresented williams interest income since it failed to reflect that the interest payments received on the notes of the venture capital companies were funded entirely by williams own loans to those companies the statement thus falsely implied according to the government that williams was deriving interest income from an independent outside source brief for united states  shortly after arraignment the district court granted williams motion for disclosure of all exculpatory portions of the grand jury transcripts see brady v maryland  us   sct   ledd   upon reviewing this material williams demanded that the district court dismiss the indictment alleging that the government had failed to fulfill its obligation under the tenth circuits prior decision in united states v page  fd    to present substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury emphasis omitted his contention was that evidence which the government had chosen not to present to the grand juryin particular williams general ledgers and tax returns and williams testimony in his contemporaneous chapter  bankruptcy proceedingdisclosed that for tax purposes and otherwise he had regularly accounted for the notes receivable and the interest on them in a manner consistent with the balance sheet and the income statement this he contended belied an intent to mislead the banks and thus directly negated an essential element of the charged offense the district court initially denied williams motion but upon reconsideration ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice it found after a hearing that the withheld evidence was relevant to an essential element of the crime charged created  a reasonable doubt about respondents guilt  app to pet for cert aa quoting united states v gray  fsupp   dc  and thus rendered the grand jurys decision to indict gravely suspect app to pet for cert a upon the governments appeal the court of appeals affirmed the district courts order following its earlier decision in page supra it first sustained as not clearly erroneous the district courts determination that the government had withheld substantial exculpatory evidence from the grand jury see  fd   ca  it then found that the governments behavior  substantially influenced  the grand jurys decision to indict or at the very least raised a  grave doubt that the decision to indict was free from such substantial influence  id at  quoting bank of nova scotia v united states  us    sct    ledd   see id at  under these circumstances the tenth circuit concluded it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to require the government to begin anew before the grand jury  we granted certiorari  us   sct   ledd   ii before proceeding to the merits of this matter it is necessary to discuss the propriety of reaching them certiorari was sought and granted in this case on the following question whether an indictment may be dismissed because the government failed to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury the first point discussed in respondents brief opposing the petition was captioned the question presented in the petition was never raised below brief in opposition  in granting certiorari we necessarily considered and rejected that contention as a basis for denying review justice stevens dissent however revisits that issue and proposes thatafter briefing argument and full consideration of the issue by all the justices of this courtwe now decline to entertain this petition for the same reason we originally rejected and that we dismiss it as improvidently granted that would be improvident indeed our grant of certiorari was entirely in accord with our traditional practice though even if it were not it would be imprudent since there is no doubt that we have jurisdiction to entertain the case to reverse course at this late stage see eg ferguson v mooremccormack lines  us    sct    ledd   harlan j concurring in part and dissenting in part donnelly v dechristoforo  us    sct    ledd   stewart j concurring joined by white j cf oklahoma city v tuttle  us    sct    ledd   our traditional rule as the dissent correctly notes precludes a grant of certiorari only when the question presented was not pressed or passed upon below post at  internal quotation marks omitted that this rule operates as it is phrased in the disjunctive permitting review of an issue not pressed so long as it has been passed upon is illustrated by some of our more recent dispositions as recently as last term in fact in an opinion joined by justice stevens we entertained review in circumstances far more suggestive of the petitioners sleeping on its rights than those we face today we responded as follows to the argument of the solicitor general that tracks todays dissent the solicitor general    submits that the petition for certiorari should be dismissed as having been improvidently granted he rests this submission on the argument that petitioner did not properly present the merits of the timeliness issue to the court of appeals and that this court should not address that question for the first time he made the same argument in his opposition to the petition for certiorari we rejected that argument in granting certiorari and we reject it again now because the court of appeals like the district court before it decided the substantive issue presented stevens v department of treasury  us    sct    ledd   citations omitted opinion of blackmun j and in another case decided last term we said the following respondents argue that this issue was not raised below the appeals court however addressed the availability of a right of action to minority shareholders in respondents circumstances and concluded that respondents were entitled to sue it suffices for our purposes that the court below passed on the issue presented particularly where the issue is we believe in a state of evolving definition and uncertainty and one of importance to the administration of federal law virginia bankshares inc v sandberg  us   n   sct   n   ledd   citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted justice stevens separate concurrence and dissent in virginia bankshares also reached the merits id at   sct at   as justice oconnor has written the standard we previously have employed is that we will not review a question not pressed or passed on by the courts below here the court of appeals expressly ruled on the question in an appropriate exercise of its appellate jurisdiction it is therefore entirely proper in light of our precedents for the court to reach the question on which it granted certiorari    springfield v kibbe  us    sct    ledd   oconnor j dissenting emphasis in original citations omitted  there is no doubt in the present case that the tenth circuit decided the crucial issue of the prosecutors duty to present exculpatory evidence  moreover this is not as the dissent paints it a case in which after losing in the court of appeals the government reversed its position post at  the dissent describes the government as having expressly acknowledged in the court of appeals the responsibilities described in page post at  emphasis added it did no such thing rather the government acknowledged that it has certain responsibilities under    page brief for the united states in response to appellees brief in nos   ca p  emphasis added it conceded in other words not that the responsibilities page had imposed were proper but merely that page had imposed themover the protests of the government but in a judgment that was nonetheless binding precedent for the panel below the dissent would apparently impose as an absolute condition to our granting certiorari upon an issue decided by a lower court that a party demand overruling of a squarely applicable recent circuit precedent even though that precedent was established in a case to which the party itself was privy and over the partys vigorous objection see page  fd at  the government counters that a prosecutor has no duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to a grand jury and even though no intervening developments in the law post at  n  had occurred that seems to us unreasonable in short having reconsidered the precise question we resolved when this petition for review was granted we again answer it the same way it is a permissible exercise of our discretion to undertake review of an important issue expressly decided by a federal court  where although the petitioner did not contest the issue in the case immediately at hand it did so as a party to the recent proceeding upon which the lower courts relied for their resolution of the issue and did not concede in the current case the correctness of that precedent undoubtedly the united states benefits from this rule more often than other parties but that is inevitably true of most desirable rules of procedure or jurisdiction that we announce the united states being the most frequent litigant in our courts since we announce the rule to be applicable to all parties since we have recently applied a similar rule indeed a rule even more broadly cast to the disadvantage of the united states see stevens v department of treasury  us   sct   ledd   and since the dissenters themselves have approved the application of this rule or a broader one in circumstances rationally indistinguishable from those before us see n  supra the dissents suggestion that in deciding this case the court appears to favor the government over the ordinary litigant post at  and compromises its obligation to administer justice impartially ibid needs no response iii respondent does not contend that the fifth amendment itself obliges the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence in his possession to the grand jury instead building on our statement that the federal courts may within limits formulate procedural rules not specifically required by the constitution or the congress united states v hasting  us    sct    ledd   he argues that imposition of the tenth circuits disclosure rule is supported by the courts supervisory power we think not hasting and the cases that rely upon the principle it expresses deal strictly with the courts power to control their own procedures see eg jencks v united states  us    sct    ledd   mcnabb v united states  us   sct   led   that power has been applied not only to improve the truthfinding process of the trial see eg mesarosh v united states  us    sct    ledd   but also to prevent parties from reaping benefit or incurring harm from violations of substantive or procedural rules imposed by the constitution or laws governing matters apart from the trial itself see eg weeks v united states  us   sct   led   thus bank of nova scotia v united states  us   sct   ledd   makes clear that the supervisory power can be used to dismiss an indictment because of misconduct before the grand jury at least where that misconduct amounts to a violation of one of those few clear rules which were carefully drafted and approved by this court and by congress to ensure the integrity of the grand jurys functions united states v mechanik  us    sct    ledd   oconnor j concurring in judgment  we did not hold in bank of nova scotia however that the courts supervisory power could be used not merely as a means of enforcing or vindicating legally compelled standards of prosecutorial conduct before the grand jury but as a means of prescribing those standards of prosecutorial conduct in the first instancejust as it may be used as a means of establishing standards of prosecutorial conduct before the courts themselves it is this latter exercise that respondent demands because the grand jury is an institution separate from the courts over whose functioning the courts do not preside we think it clear that as a general matter at least no such supervisory judicial authority exists and that the disclosure rule applied here exceeded the tenth circuits authority rooted in long centuries of angloamerican history hannah v larche  us    sct    ledd   frankfurter j concurring in result the grand jury is mentioned in the bill of rights but not in the body of the constitution it has not been textually assigned therefore to any of the branches described in the first three articles it  is a constitutional fixture in its own right  united states v chanen  fd   ca  quoting nixon v sirica  usappdc   n   fd   n   cert denied  us   sct   ledd   in fact the whole theory of its function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the government and the people see stirone v united states  us    sct    ledd   hale v henkel  us    sct    led   g edwards the grand jury   although the grand jury normally operates of course in the courthouse and under judicial auspices its institutional relationship with the judicial branch has traditionally been so to speak at arms length judges direct involvement in the functioning of the grand jury has generally been confined to the constitutive one of calling the grand jurors together and administering their oaths of office see united states v calandra  us    sct    ledd   fedrule crimproc a the grand jurys functional independence from the judicial branch is evident both in the scope of its power to investigate criminal wrongdoing and in the manner in which that power is exercised unlike a court whose jurisdiction is predicated upon a specific case or controversy the grand jury can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is being violated or even because it wants assurance that it is not  united states v r enterprises  us    sct    ledd   quoting united states v morton salt co  us    sct    led   it need not identify the offender it suspects or even the precise nature of the offense it is investigating blair v united states  us    sct    led   the grand jury requires no authorization from its constituting court to initiate an investigation see hale supra  us at    sct at   nor does the prosecutor require leave of court to seek a grand jury indictment and in its daytoday functioning the grand jury generally operates without the interference of a presiding judge see calandra supra  us at   sct at  it swears in its own witnesses fedrule crimproc c and deliberates in total secrecy see united states v sells engineering inc  us at   sct at  true the grand jury cannot compel the appearance of witnesses and the production of evidence and must appeal to the court when such compulsion is required see eg brown v united states  us    sct    ledd   and the court will refuse to lend its assistance when the compulsion the grand jury seeks would override rights accorded by the constitution see eg gravel v united states  us   sct   ledd   grand jury subpoena effectively qualified by order limiting questioning so as to preserve speech or debate clause immunity or even testimonial privileges recognized by the common law see in re grand jury investigation of hugle  fd  ca  same with respect to privilege for confidential marital communications opinion of kennedy j even in this setting however we have insisted that the grand jury remain free to pursue its investigations unhindered by external influence or supervision so long as it does not trench upon the legitimate rights of any witness called before it united states v dionisio  us    sct    ledd   recognizing this tradition of independence we have said that the fifth amendments constitutional guarantee presupposes an investigative body acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge     id at   sct at  emphasis added quoting stirone supra  us at   sct at  no doubt in view of the grand jury proceedings status as other than a constituent element of a criminal prosecution us const amdt vi we have said that certain constitutional protections afforded defendants in criminal proceedings have no application before that body the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment does not bar a grand jury from returning an indictment when a prior grand jury has refused to do so see ex parte united states  us    sct    led   united states v thompson  us    sct    led   we have twice suggested though not held that the sixth amendment right to counsel does not attach when an individual is summoned to appear before a grand jury even if he is the subject of the investigation see united states v mandujano  us    sct    ledd   plurality opinion in re groban  us    sct    ledd   see also fedrule crimproc d and although the grand jury may not force a witness to answer questions in violation of the fifth amendments constitutional guarantee against selfincrimination calandra supra  us at   sct at  citing kastigar v united states  us   sct   ledd   our cases suggest that an indictment obtained through the use of evidence previously obtained in violation of the privilege against selfincrimination is nevertheless valid calandra supra  us at   sct at  see lawn v united states  us    sct    ledd   united states v blue  us   n   sct   n   ledd   given the grand jurys operational separateness from its constituting court it should come as no surprise that we have been reluctant to invoke the judicial supervisory power as a basis for prescribing modes of grand jury procedure over the years we have received many requests to exercise supervision over the grand jurys evidencetaking process but we have refused them all including some more appealing than the one presented today in calandra v united states supra a grand jury witness faced questions that were allegedly based upon physical evidence the government had obtained through a violation of the fourth amendment we rejected the proposal that the exclusionary rule be extended to grand jury proceedings because of the potential injury to the historic role and functions of the grand jury  us at   sct at  in costello v united states  us   sct   led   we declined to enforce the hearsay rule in grand jury proceedings since that would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules id at   sct at  these authorities suggest that any power federal courts may have to fashion on their own initiative rules of grand jury procedure is a very limited one not remotely comparable to the power they maintain over their own proceedings see united states v chanen  fd at  it certainly would not permit judicial reshaping of the grand jury institution substantially altering the traditional relationships between the prosecutor the constituting court and the grand jury itself cf eg united states v payner  us    sct    ledd   supervisory power may not be applied to permit defendant to invoke third partys fourth amendment rights see generally beale reconsidering supervisory power in criminal cases constitutional and statutory limits on the authority of the federal courts  columlrev     as we proceed to discuss that would be the consequence of the proposed rule here respondent argues that the court of appeals rule can be justified as a sort of fifth amendment common law a necessary means of assuring the constitutional right to the judgment of an independent and informed grand jury wood v georgia  us    sct    ledd   brief for respondent  respondent makes a generalized appeal to functional notions judicial supervision of the quantity and quality of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury plainly facilitates he says the grand jurys performance of its twin historical responsibilities ie bringing to trial those who may be justly accused and shielding the innocent from unfounded accusation and prosecution see eg stirone v united states  us at  n   sct at  n  we do not agree the rule would neither preserve nor enhance the traditional functioning of the institution that the fifth amendment demands to the contrary requiring the prosecutor to present exculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter the grand jurys historical role transforming it from an accusatory to an adjudicatory body it is axiomatic that the grand jury sits not to determine guilt or innocence but to assess whether there is adequate basis for bringing a criminal charge see united states v calandra  us at   sct at  that has always been so and to make the assessment it has always been thought sufficient to hear only the prosecutors side as blackstone described the prevailing practice in thcentury england the grand jury was only to hear evidence on behalf of the prosecution for the finding of an indictment is only in the nature of an enquiry or accusation which is afterwards to be tried and determined  w blackstone commentaries   see also  m hale pleas of the crown  st am ed  so also in the united states according to the description of an early american court three years before the fifth amendment was ratified it is the grand jurys function not to enquire    upon what foundation the charge may be denied or otherwise to try the suspects defenses but only to examine upon what foundation the charge is made by the prosecutor respublica v shaffer  us  dall   led  philadelphia oyer and terminer  see also f wharton criminal pleading and practice §  pp  th ed  as a consequence neither in this country nor in england has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thought to have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidence presented see  hale supra at  united states ex rel mccann v thompson  fd   ca cert denied  us   sct   led   imposing upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to present exculpatory evidence in his possession would be incompatible with this system if a balanced assessment of the entire matter is the objective surely the first thing to be donerather than requiring the prosecutor to say what he knows in defense of the target of the investigationis to entitle the target to tender his own defense to require the former while denying as we do the latter would be quite absurd it would also be quite pointless since it would merely invite the target to circumnavigate the system by delivering his exculpatory evidence to the prosecutor whereupon it would have to be passed on to the grand juryunless the prosecutor is willing to take the chance that a court will not deem the evidence important enough to qualify for mandatory disclosure  see eg united states v law firm of zimmerman  schwartz pc  fsupp   colo duty to disclose exculpatory evidence held satisfied when prosecution tendered to the grand jury defenseprovided exhibits testimony and explanations of the governing law affd sub nom united states v brown  fd   ca  respondent acknowledges as he must that the common law of the grand jury is not violated if the grand jury itself chooses to hear no more evidence than that which suffices to convince it an indictment is proper cf thompson supra at  thus had the government offered to familiarize the grand jury in this case with the five boxes of financial statements and deposition testimony alleged to contain exculpatory information and had the grand jury rejected the offer as pointless respondent would presumably agree that the resulting indictment would have been valid respondent insists however that courts must require the modern prosecutor to alert the grand jury to the nature and extent of the available exculpatory evidence because otherwise the grand jury merely functions as an arm of the prosecution brief for respondent  we reject the attempt to convert a nonexistent duty of the grand jury itself into an obligation of the prosecutor the authority of the prosecutor to seek an indictment has long been understood to be coterminous with the authority of the grand jury to entertain the prosecutors charges united states v thompson  us    sct    led   if the grand jury has no obligation to consider all substantial exculpatory evidence we do not understand how the prosecutor can be said to have a binding obligation to present it there is yet another respect in which respondents proposal not only fails to comport with but positively contradicts the common law of the fifth amendment grand jury motions to quash indictments based upon the sufficiency of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury were unheard of at common law in england see eg people v restenblatt  abbprac   ctgensessny and the traditional american practice was described by justice nelson riding circuit in  as follows no case has been cited nor have we been able to find any furnishing an authority for looking into and revising the judgment of the grand jury upon the evidence for the purpose of determining whether or not the finding was founded upon sufficient proof or whether there was a deficiency in respect to any part of the complaint    united states v reed  fedcas   no  ccndny  we accepted justice nelsons description in costello v united states  us   sct   led   where we held that it would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution to permit an indictment to be challenged on the ground that there was incompetent or inadequate evidence before the grand jury id at   sct at  and we reaffirmed this principle recently in bank of nova scotia where we held that the mere fact that evidence itself is unreliable is not sufficient to require a dismissal of the indictment and that a challenge to the reliability or competence of the evidence presented to the grand jury will not be heard  us at   sct at  it would make little sense we think to abstain from reviewing the evidentiary support for the grand jurys judgment while scrutinizing the sufficiency of the prosecutors presentation a complaint about the quality or adequacy of the evidence can always be recast as a complaint that the prosecutors presentation was incomplete or misleading  our words in costello bear repeating review of facially valid indictments on such grounds would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution and neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires it  us at   sct at  echoing the reasoning of the tenth circuit in united states v page  fd at  respondent argues that a rule requiring the prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury would by removing from the docket unjustified prosecutions save valuable judicial time that depends we suppose upon what the ratio would turn out to be between unjustified prosecutions eliminated and grand jury indictments challengedfor the latter as well as the former consume valuable judicial time we need not pursue the matter if there is an advantage to the proposal congress is free to prescribe it for the reasons set forth above however we conclude that courts have no authority to prescribe such a duty pursuant to their inherent supervisory authority over their own proceedings the judgment of the court of appeals is accordingly reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion so ordered top justice stevens with whom justice blackmun and justice oconnor join and with whom justice thomas joins as to parts ii and iii dissenting the courts opinion announces two important changes in the law first it justifies its special accommodation to the solicitor general in granting certiorari to review a contention that was not advanced in either the district court or the court of appeals by explaining that the fact that the issue was raised in a different case is an adequate substitute for raising it in this case second it concludes that a federal court has no power to enforce the prosecutors obligation to protect the fundamental fairness of proceedings before the grand jury  the question presented by the certiorari petition is whether the failure to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury is a species of prosecutorial misconduct that may be remedied by dismissing an indictment without prejudice in the district court and the court of appeals both parties agreed that the answer to that question is yes in an appropriate case the only disagreement was whether this was an appropriate case the prosecutor vigorously argued that it was not because the undisclosed evidence was not substantial exculpatory evidence while respondent countered that the evidence was exculpatory and the prosecutors misconduct warranted a dismissal with prejudice in an earlier case arising in the tenth circuit united states v page  fd  cert denied  us   sct   ledd   the defendant had claimed that his indictment should have been dismissed because the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct during the grand jury proceedings specifically he claimed that the prosecutor had allowed the grand jury to consider false testimony and had failed to present it with substantial exculpatory evidence  fd at  after noting that there are two views concerning the duty of a prosecutor to present exculpatory evidence to a grand jury id at  the court concluded that the better and more balanced rule is that when substantial exculpatory evidence is discovered in the course of an investigation it must be revealed to the grand jury id at  emphasis in original the court declined to dismiss the indictment however because the evidence withheld in that case was not clearly exculpatory ibid in this case the government expressly acknowledged the responsibilities described in page but argued that the withheld evidence was not exculpatory or significant  instead of questioning the controlling rule of law it distinguished the facts of this case from those of an earlier case in which an indictment had been dismissed because the prosecutor had withheld testimony that made it factually impossible for the corporate defendant to have been guilty  the government concluded its principal brief with a request that the court apply the test set forth in bank of nova scotia v united states  us   sct   ledd   follow the holding of page  and hold that dismissal was not warranted in this case because the withheld evidence was not substantial exculpatory evidence and respondent was not prejudiced in any way brief for united states in no  ca pp  after losing in the court of appeals the government reversed its position and asked this court to grant certiorari and to hold that the prosecutor has no judicially enforceable duty to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury in his brief in opposition to the petition respondent clearly pointed out that the question presented by the petition was neither presented to nor addressed by the courts below brief in opposition  he appropriately called our attention to many of the cases in which we have stated repeated and reiterated the general rule that precludes a grant of certiorari when the question presented was not pressed or passed upon below  id at  apart from the fact that the united states is the petitioner i see no reason for not following that salutary practice in this case  nevertheless the requisite number of justices saw fit to grant the solicitor generals petition  us   sct   ledd   the court explains that the settled rule does not apply to the governments certiorari petition in this case because the government raised the same question three years earlier in the page case and the court of appeals passed on the issue in that case ante at  this is a novel and unwise change in the rule we have never suggested that the fact that a court has repeated a settled proposition of law and applied it without objection in the case at hand provides a sufficient basis for our review  see illinois v gates  us    sct    ledd   and cases cited therein if this is to be the rule in the future it will either provide a basis for a significant expansion of our discretionary docket  or if applied only to benefit repetitive litigants a special privilege for the federal government this court has a special obligation to administer justice impartially and to set an example of impartiality for other courts to emulate when the court appears to favor the government over the ordinary litigant it seriously compromises its ability to discharge that important duty for that reason alone i would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted  ii like the hydra slain by hercules prosecutorial misconduct has many heads some are cataloged in justice sutherlands classic opinion for the court in berger v united states  us   sct   led   that the united states prosecuting attorney overstepped the bounds of that propriety and fairness which should characterize the conduct of such an officer in the prosecution of a criminal offense is clearly shown by the record he was guilty of misstating the facts in his crossexamination of witnesses of putting into the mouths of such witnesses things which they had not said of suggesting by his questions that statements had been made to him personally out of court in respect of which no proof was offered of pretending to understand that a witness had said something which he had not said and persistently crossexamining the witness upon that basis of assuming prejudicial facts not in evidence of bullying and arguing with witnesses and in general of conducting himself in a thoroughly indecorous and improper manner    the prosecuting attorneys argument to the jury was undignified and intemperate containing improper insinuations and assertions calculated to mislead the jury id at   sct at  this of course is not an exhaustive list of the kinds of improper tactics that overzealous or misguided prosecutors have adopted in judicial proceedings the reported cases of this court alone contain examples of the knowing use of perjured testimony mooney v holohan  us   sct   led   the suppression of evidence favorable to an accused person brady v maryland  us    sct    ledd   and misstatements of the law in argument to the jury caldwell v mississippi  us    sct    ledd   to name just a few nor has prosecutorial misconduct been limited to judicial proceedings the reported cases indicate that it has sometimes infected grand jury proceedings as well the cases contain examples of prosecutors presenting perjured testimony united

identification of the basic reason why that sort of misconduct is intolerable merits repetition the united states attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest therefore in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case but that justice shall be done as such he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer he may prosecute with earnestness and vigorindeed he should do so but while he may strike hard blows he is not at liberty to strike foul ones it is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one berger v united states  us at   sct at  it is equally clear that the prosecutor has the same duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful indictment indeed the prosecutors duty to protect the fundamental fairness of judicial proceedings assumes special importance when he is presenting evidence to a grand jury as the court of appeals for the third circuit recognized the costs of continued unchecked prosecutorial misconduct before the grand jury are particularly substantial because there the prosecutor operates without the check of a judge or a trained legal adversary and virtually immune from public scrutiny the prosecutors abuse of his special relationship to the grand jury poses an enormous risk to defendants as well for while in theory a trial provides the defendant with a full opportunity to contest and disprove the charges against him in practice the handing up of an indictment will often have a devastating personal and professional impact that a later dismissal or acquittal can never undo where the potential for abuse is so great and the consequences of a mistaken indictment so serious the ethical responsibilities of the prosecutor and the obligation of the judiciary to protect against even the appearance of unfairness are correspondingly heightened united states v serubo  fd   ca  in his dissent in united states v ciambrone  fd  ca  judge friendly also recognized the prosecutors special role in grand jury proceedings as the supreme court has noted the founders thought the grand jury so essential to basic liberties that they provided in the fifth amendment that federal prosecution for serious crimes can only be instituted by a presentment or indictment of a grand jury  united states v calandra  us    sct    ledd      before the grand jury the prosecutor has the dual role of pressing for an indictment and of being the grand jury adviser in case of conflict the latter duty must take precedence united states v remington  fd   d cir l hand j dissenting cert denied  us   sct   led      the ex parte character of grand jury proceedings makes it peculiarly important for a federal prosecutor to remember that in the familiar phrase the interest of the united states in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case but that justice shall be done berger v united states  us    sct    led      id at   the standard for judging the consequences of prosecutorial misconduct during grand jury proceedings is essentially the same as the standard applicable to trials in united states v mechanik  us   sct   ledd   we held that there was no reason not to apply the harmless error rule to errors defects irregularities or variances occurring before a grand jury just as we have applied it to such error occurring in the criminal trial itself id at   sct at  we repeated that holding in bank of nova scotia v united states  us   sct   ledd   when we rejected a defendants argument that an indictment should be dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct and irregularities in proceedings before the grand jury referring to the prosecutors misconduct before the grand jury we concluded that our customary harmlesserror inquiry is applicable where as in the cases before us a court is asked to dismiss an indictment prior to the conclusion of the trial id at   sct at  moreover in reviewing the instances of misconduct in that case we applied precisely the same standard to the prosecutors violations of rule  of the federal rules of criminal procedure and to his violations of the general duty of fairness that applies to all judicial proceedings this point is illustrated by the courts comments on the prosecutors abuse of a witness the district court found that a prosecutor was abusive to an expert defense witness during a recess and in the hearing of some grand jurors although the government concedes that the treatment of the expert tax witness was improper the witness himself testified that his testimony was unaffected by this misconduct the prosecutors instructed the grand jury to disregard anything they may have heard in conversations between a prosecutor and a witness and explained to the grand jury that such conversations should have no influence on its deliberations app  in light of these ameliorative measures there is nothing to indicate that the prosecutors conduct toward this witness substantially affected the grand jurys evaluation of the testimony or its decision to indict  us at   sct at  unquestionably the plain implication of that discussion is that if the misconduct even though not expressly forbidden by any written rule had played a critical role in persuading the jury to return the indictment dismissal would have been required in an opinion that i find difficult to comprehend the court today repudiates the assumptions underlying these cases and seems to suggest that the court has no authority to supervise the conduct of the prosecutor in grand jury proceedings so long as he follows the dictates of the constitution applicable statutes and rule  of the federal rules of criminal procedure the court purports to support this conclusion by invoking the doctrine of separation of powers and citing a string of cases in which we have declined to impose categorical restraints on the grand jury needless to say the courts reasoning is unpersuasive although the grand jury has not been textually assigned to any of the branches described in the first three articles of the constitution ante at  it is not an autonomous body completely beyond the reach of the other branches throughout its life from the moment it is convened until it is discharged the grand jury is subject to the control of the court as judge learned hand recognized over sixty years ago a grand jury is neither an officer nor an agent of the united states but a part of the court falter v united states  fd   ca cert denied  us   sct   led   this court has similarly characterized the grand jury a grand jury is clothed with great independence in many areas but it remains an appendage of the court powerless to perform its investigative function without the courts aid because powerless itself to compel the testimony of witnesses it is the courts process which summons the witness to attend and give testimony and it is the court which must compel a witness to testify if after appearing he refuses to do so brown v united states  us    sct    ledd   see also blair v united states  us    sct    led   at the foundation of our federal government the inquisitorial function of the grand jury and the compulsion of witnesses were recognized as incidents of the judicial power of the united states united states v calandra  us   and n   sct   and n   ledd   this court has of course long recognized that the grand jury has wide latitude to investigate violations of federal law as it deems appropriate and need not obtain permission from either the court or the prosecutor see eg id at   sct at  costello v united states  us    sct    led   hale v henkel  us    sct    led   correspondingly we have acknowledged that its operation generally is unrestrained by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing the conduct of criminal trials calandra  us at   sct at  but this is because congress and the court have generally thought it best not to impose procedural restraints on the grand jury it is not because they lack all power to do so  to the contrary the court has recognized that it has the authority to create and enforce limited rules applicable in grand jury proceedings thus for example the court has said that the grand jury may not itself violate a valid privilege whether established by the constitution statutes or the common law id at   sct at  and the court may prevent a grand jury from violating such a privilege by quashing or modifying a subpoena id at  n   sct at  n  or issuing a protective order forbidding questions in violation of the privilege gravel v united states  us    sct    ledd   moreover there are as the court notes ante at  a series of cases in which we declined to impose categorical restraints on the grand jury in none of those cases however did we question our power to reach a contrary result  although the court recognizes that it may invoke its supervisory authority to fashion and enforce privilege rules applicable in grand jury proceedings ante at  and suggests that it may also invoke its supervisory authority to fashion other limited rules of grand jury procedure ante at  it concludes that it has no authority to prescribe standards of prosecutorial conduct before the grand jury ante at  because that would alter the grand jurys historic role as an independent inquisitorial institution i disagree we do not protect the integrity and independence of the grand jury by closing our eyes to the countless forms of prosecutorial misconduct that may occur inside the secrecy of the grand jury room after all the grand jury is not merely an investigatory body it also serves as a protector of citizens against arbitrary and oppressive governmental action united states v calandra  us at   sct at  explaining why the grand jury must be both independent and informed the court wrote in wood v georgia  us   sct   ledd   historically this body has been regarded as a primary security to the innocent against hasty malicious and oppressive persecution it serves the invaluable function in our society of standing between the accuser and the accused whether the latter be an individual minority group or other to determine whether a charge is founded upon reason or was dictated by an intimidating power or by malice and personal ill will id at   sct at  it blinks reality to say that the grand jury can adequately perform this important historic role if it is intentionally misled by the prosecutoron whose knowledge of the law and facts of the underlying criminal investigation the jurors will of necessity rely unlike the court i am unwilling to hold that countless forms of prosecutorial misconduct must be toleratedno matter how prejudicial they may be or how seriously they may distort the legitimate function of the grand jurysimply because they are not proscribed by rule  of the federal rules of criminal procedure or a statute that is applicable in grand jury proceedings such a sharp break with the traditional role of the federal judiciary is unprecedented unwarranted and unwise unrestrained prosecutorial misconduct in grand jury proceedings is inconsistent with the administration of justice in the federal courts and should be redressed in appropriate cases by the dismissal of indictments obtained by improper methods  iii what then is the proper disposition of this case i agree with the government that the prosecutor is not required to place all exculpatory evidence before the grand jury a grand jury proceeding is an ex parte investigatory proceeding to determine whether there is probable cause to believe a violation of the criminal laws has occurred not a trial requiring the prosecutor to ferret out and present all evidence that could be used at trial to create a reasonable doubt as to the defendants guilt would be inconsistent with the purpose of the grand jury proceeding and would place significant burdens on the investigation but that does not mean that the prosecutor may mislead the grand jury into believing that there is probable cause to indict by withholding clear evidence to the contrary i thus agree with the department of justice that when a prosecutor conducting a grand jury inquiry is personally aware of substantial evidence which directly negates the guilt of a subject of the investigation the prosecutor must present or otherwise disclose such evidence to the grand jury before seeking an indictment against such a person us dept of justice united states attorneys manual title  ch  ¶    although i question whether the evidence withheld in this case directly negates respondents guilt  i need not resolve my doubts because the solicitor general did not ask the court to review the nature of the evidence withheld instead he asked us to decide the legal question whether an indictment may be dismissed because the prosecutor failed to present exculpatory evidence unlike the court and the solicitor general i believe the answer to that question is yes if the withheld evidence would plainly preclude a finding of probable cause i therefore cannot endorse the courts opinion more importantly because i am so firmly opposed to the courts favored treatment of the government as a litigator i would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted cc∅  transformed by publicresourceorg  the tenth circuit also rejected williams crossappeal which contended that the district courts dismissal should have been with prejudice see  fd at   the dissent purports to distinguish stevens and virginia bankshares on the ground that although the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the petitions    before the courts of appeals in those cases the courts treated the questions as open questions that they needed to resolve in order to decide the cases post at  n  the significance of this distinction completely eludes us while there is much to be said for a rule to which the court has never adhered limiting review to questions pressed by the litigants below the rule implicitly proposed by the dissentunder which issues not pressed but nevertheless passed upon may be reviewed only if the court below thought the issue an open onemakes no sense except as a device to distinguish stevens and virginia bankshares it does nothing to further the adversary process that is the object of the dissents concern post at  n  if a question is not disputed by the parties the adversary process is compromised whether the court thinks the question open or not indeed if anything it is compromised more when the lower court believes it is confronting a question of first impression for it is in those circumstances that the need for an adversary presentation is most acute the dissent observes that where a court disposes of a case on the basis of a new rule that had not been debated by the parties our review may be appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise have to challenge the rule post at  n  that is true enough but the suggestion that this principle has something to do with stevens and virginia bankshares is wholly unfounded in neither case couldor didthe losing party claim to have been ambushed by the lower courts summary treatment of the undisputed issues which we later subjected to plenary review  the courts per curiam dismissal of the writ in kibbe was based principally upon two considerations  that the crucial issue was not raised in the district court because of failure to object to a jury instruction thus invoking rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure which provides that no party may assign as error the giving    of an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict and  that the crucial issue had in addition not explicitly been raised in the petition for certiorari  us at    sct at   of course neither circumstance exists here  relying upon and to some extent repeating the reasoning of its earlier holding in page the court of appeals said the following we have previously held that a prosecutor has the duty to present substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury although we do not require the prosecutor to ferret out and present every bit of potentially exculpatory evidence we do require that substantial exculpatory evidence discovered during the course of an investigation be revealed to the grand jury other courts have also recognized that such a duty exists this requirement promotes judicial economy because if a fully informed grand jury cannot find probable cause to indict there is little chance the prosecution could have proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a fully informed petit jury   fd   ca  citations omitted this excerpt from the opinion below should make abundantly clear that contrary to the dissents mystifying assertion see post at  and n  we premise our grant of certiorari not upon the tenth circuits having passed on the issue in its prior page decision but rather upon its having done so in this

united states in response to appellees brief in nos   ca pp   respondent had relied on united states v phillips petroleum co  fsupp  nd okla the government distinguished the case based on the type of evidence excluded in phillips supra the prosecutor sent the grand jury home for the day but continued questioning a witness in that session outside the hearing of the grand jury members the witness who had been granted use immunity testified to certain information which showed that the witness had been the one who knowingly committed an offense and showed that the corporation had not intentionally committed an offense in that case there was no question that the withheld testimony made it factually impossible for the corporate defendant to have been guilty and therefore the evidence was substantial and exculpatory in the instant case there is a disagreement between the government and the defendant as to whether the documents the defendant wants presented in full are

department of treasury  us   sct   ledd   and virginia bankshares inc v sandberg  us   sct   ledd   discussed by the court ante at  were routine applications of the settled rule although the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the petitions for certiorari before the courts of appeals in those cases the courts treated the questions as open questions that they needed to resolve in order to decide the cases similarly in springfield v kibbe  us   sct   ledd   the court of appeals had expressly considered and answered the question that justice oconnor thought we should decide see id at   sct at  this case in contrast involved the routine restatement and application of settled law by an appellate court which we have previously found insufficient to satisfy the pressed or passed upon below rule illinois v gates  us    sct    ledd    the court expresses an inability to understand the difference between the routine application without objection of a settled rule on the one hand and the decision of an open question on a ground not argued by the parties on the other the difference is best explained in light of the basic assumption that the adversary process provides the best method of arriving at correct decisions rules of appellate practice generally require that an issue be actually raised and debated by the parties if it is to be preserved in the exceptional case in which an appellate court announces a new rule that had not been debated by the parties our review may be appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise have to challenge the rule in this case however there is no reason why the government could not have challenged the page rule in this case in the tenth circuit there is no need for an exception to preserve the losing litigants opportunity to be heard moreover the governments failure to object to the application of the page rule deprived the court of appeals of an opportunity to reexamine the validity of that rule in the light of intervening developments in the law sandbagging is just as improper in an appellate court as in a trial court  the expressed or passed on predicate for the exercise of our jurisdiction is of special importance in determining our power to review state court judgments if the courts newly announced view that the routine application of a settled rule satisfies the passed on requirement in a federal case i see no reason why it should not also satisfy the same requirement in a state case  the court suggests that it would be improvident for the court to dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that the government failed to raise the question presented in the lower courts because respondent raised this argument in his brief in opposition the court nevertheless granted the writ and the case has been briefed and argued ante at  i disagree the vote of four justices is sufficient to grant a petition for certiorari but that action does not preclude a majority of the court from dismissing the writ as improvidently granted after the case has been argued see eg naacp v overstreet  us   sct   ledd   dismissing after oral argument writ as improvidently granted over the dissent of four justices we have frequently dismissed the writ as improvidently granted after the case has been briefed and argued in fact we have already done so twice this term see gibson v florida bar  us   sct   ledd   pfz properties inc v rodriguez  us   sct   ledd   although we do not always explain the reason for the dismissal we have on occasion dismissed the writ for the reasons raised by the respondent in the brief in opposition thus nothing precludes the court from dismissing the writ in this case  the court found the government guilty of prosecutorial misconduct because it failed to provide the polygraph evidence to the grand jury despite the prosecutors guarantee to judge pregerson that all exculpatory evidence would be presented to the grand jury and compounded this indiscretion by erroneously but unequivocally telling the grand jury that the polygraph evidence was inadmissible united states v roberts  fsupp at   although the majority in ciambrone did not agree with judge friendlys appraisal of the prejudicial impact of the misconduct in that case it also recognized the prosecutors duty to avoid fundamentally unfair tactics during the grand jury proceedings judge mansfield explained on the other hand the prosecutors right to exercise some discretion and selectivity in the presentation of evidence to a grand jury does not entitle him to mislead it or to engage in fundamentally unfair tactics before it the prosecutor for instance may not obtain an indictment on the basis of evidence known to him to be perjurious united states v basurto  fd   th cir or by leading it to believe that it has received eyewitness rather than hearsay testimony united states v estepa  fd   d cir we would add that where a prosecutor is aware of any substantial evidence negating guilt he should in the interest of justice make it known to the grand jury at least where it might reasonably be expected to lead the jury not to indict see aba project on standards for criminal justicethe prosecution function §  pp   fd at   indeed even the court acknowledges that congress has the power to regulate the grand jury for it concedes that congress is free to prescribe a rule requiring the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury ante at   in costello v united states  us    sct    led   for example the court held that an indictment based solely on hearsay evidence is not invalid under the grand jury clause of the fifth amendment the court then rejected the petitioners argument that it should invoke its power to supervise the administration of justice in federal courts to create a rule permitting defendants to challenge indictments based on unreliable hearsay evidence the court declined to exercise its power in this way because no persuasive reasons are advanced for establishing such a rule it would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a change id at   sct at   although the courts opinion barely mentions the fact that the grand jury was intended to serve the invaluable function of standing between the accuser and the accused i must assume that in a proper case it will acknowledgeas even the solicitor general doesthat unrestrained prosecutorial misconduct in grand jury proceedings could so subvert the integrity of the grand jury process as to justify judicial intervention cf franks v delaware  us    sct    ledd   discussing analogous considerations in holding that a search warrant affidavit may be challenged when supported by deliberately false police statements brief for united states  n   i am reluctant to rely on the lower courts judgment in this regard as they apparently applied a more lenient legal standard the district court dismissed the indictment because the information withheld raises reasonable doubt about the defendants intent to defraud and thus renders the grand jurys decision to indict gravely suspect app to pet for cert a the court of appeals affirmed this decision because it was not clearly erroneous
