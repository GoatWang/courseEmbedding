physician with advanced knowledge and training in diagnosing and treating pain these doctors do not come from one particular discipline but rather use their respective backgrounds to contribute a varied approach to the field of pain management these specialists use their different skills and training in pain management to treat pain stemming from different causes  whether its neuropathic pain or headache or the result of injury a surgical procedure cancer or another illness pain management specialists are primarily trained as anesthesiologists physiatrists interventional radiologists neurologists osteopaths or primary care physicians anesthesiology anesthesiologists are physicians who are trained to administer anesthetics which are medicines used to block nerve sensation anesthesia can be either local to one specific part of a body like a tooth or regional to block feeling to a larger portion of the body such as during an epidural for child birth it can also be more general to block sensation to the entire body resulting in unconsciousness anesthesiologists assist in surgery by determining how much anesthesia is necessary and by monitoring the patients level of responsiveness and vital signs throughout the procedure the anesthesia specialist will also bring the patient out of anesthesia and then continue to monitor his or her vital signs postoperation besides assisting in surgeries anesthesiologists may also treat patients suffering from chronic pain specialties pain managementanesthesiology schools university of south carolina school of

flsaint joseph berea berea ky information about group practices what is a group practice according to the medical group management association a group practice is any relationship between three or more physicians who share facilities expenses profits and other resources like support staff and equipment group practices tend to fall into two categories those that organize around a particular medical specialty and those that encompass several specialties like east boston neighborhood health that specializes in internal medicine why group practice as medicine became more complex in the twentieth century the need for group practices made more sense physicians found it impossible to know everything about the emerging drugs and technologies on the medical landscape in addition the cost of providing a full range of diagnostic services such as tests and xrays in one location became prohibitive to the individual practitioner hence doctors from various disciplines began to team together in order to provide more comprehensive care to their community of patients benefits of group practice access to doctors from various disciplines for referrals and advice better coverage on weekends
