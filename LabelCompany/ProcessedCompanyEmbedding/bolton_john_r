rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work on may   at the hay festival of literature  arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an

representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made

encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the

were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his

previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later

are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir

presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced

negotiating with many countries to sign agreements called article  agreements with the us to exempt americans from prosecution by the court which is not recognized by the us more than  countries have signed such agreements bolton said the decision to pull out of the icc was the happiest moment of his political career to date weapons of mass destructionedit bolton was instrumental in derailing a  biological weapons conference in geneva convened to endorse a un proposal to enforce the  biological weapons convention us officials led by bolton argued that the plan would have put us national

successful in pushing his agenda but his bluntness has won him many enemies irans foreign ministry has called bolton rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to

wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security

nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign relation committee staff townsel detailed her accusations against bolton which were confirmed by canadian designer uno ramat who had served as an ibtci employee and one of townsels aid colleagues time magazine among other publications verified townsels accusations and ramats supporting testimony and townsels story was transcribed and entered into the official senate committee record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the democrats filibusteredit on may   senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination accusations of false statementedit on july   it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation recess appointmentedit

appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr bolton but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the united nations term at the unedit the economist called bolton the most controversial ambassador ever sent by america to the united nations some colleagues in the un appreciated the goals bolton was trying to achieve but not his abrasive style the new york times

determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february  he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked – and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november   immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the th congress to the democratic party chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for on december   bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december   effective when his recess appointment ended december  at the formal adjournment of the th congress the announcement was characterized as boltons resignation by the associated press united press international abc news and other news sources as well as a white house press release and president bush himself the white house however later objected to the use of this language deputy press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step down to leave or to exit support for boltonedit during his confirmation hearings in  letters with signatures of more than  coworkers and professional colleagues were sent to senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in praise of bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff in late  when his nomination was again before the committee another letter signed by more than  professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to senator lugar a

research areas in foreign policy and international organizations in boltons time at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank he spoke against the policy of rewarding north korea for

directors for ems technologies inc elmg a georgiabased tech company that subcontracts for many dod contractorscitation needed he is a frequent guest on the fox news channel criticism of the obama administrationedit john bolton spoke on foreign policy challenges for the obama administration at chatham house in  bolton likened the president to æthelred the unready the turn of the first millennium anglosaxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful effort to buy off viking raiders made him historys paradigmatic weak leader in an interview with the los angeles times bolton contended that obamas efforts on international issues are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it john bolton caused a controversy on december   when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september   that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or

on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer bolton endorsed their book writing this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing still peoples mujahedin of iranedit bolton has spoken in favor of the peoples mujahedin of iran also known as the mujahedine khalq or mek an armed islamic group with marxist leanings which has long been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam in the s mek members who had been trained by the soviet union in guerilla warfare and supported khomeini  assassinated us military officers then working in iran mek members actively took part in the  seizure of the us embassy in tehran according to a us government report according to conservative activist kenneth timmerman executive director of the foundation for democracy in iran iranianamericans openly refer to mek leader massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents on january   bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts  decision in holder v humanitarian law project however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in  and the usa in  presidential considerationedit edit john bolton speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february   bolton considered running for president in the  us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in  republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state on january   bolton endorsed mitt romney for the  republican nomination edit bolton considered running in the  us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in  my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may   in a video message posted from twitter on wednesday september   freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on

nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december   bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state candidate for the incoming trump administration several trump associates claim bolton was not chosen in part due to trumps disdain for boltons signature mustache the evening of december  the bbc cited nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were  saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december  bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in  may have been a “false flag” operation however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t

negotiating with many countries to sign agreements called article  agreements with the us to exempt americans from prosecution by the court which is not recognized by the us more than  countries have signed such agreements bolton said the decision to pull out of the icc was the happiest moment of his political career to date weapons of mass destructionedit bolton was instrumental in derailing a  biological weapons conference in geneva convened to endorse a un proposal to enforce the  biological weapons convention us officials led by bolton argued that the plan would have put us national security at risk by allowing spot inspections of suspected us weapons sites despite the fact that the us claims not to have carried out any research for offensive purposes since  also in  bolton is said to have flown to europe to demand the resignation of jose bustani head of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session

successful in pushing his agenda but his bluntness has won him many enemies irans foreign ministry has called bolton rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work on may   at the hay festival of literature  arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security personnel in june  bolton dismissed palestinian claims to statehood as a ploy in july  bolton was identified as a key member of groundswell a secretive coalition of right wing activists and journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of highlevel contacts permanent representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign relation committee staff townsel detailed her accusations against bolton which were confirmed by canadian designer uno ramat who had served as an ibtci employee and one of townsels aid colleagues time magazine among other publications verified townsels accusations and ramats supporting testimony and townsels story was transcribed and entered into the official senate committee record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the democrats filibusteredit on may   senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination accusations of false statementedit on july   it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation recess appointmentedit wikinews has related news bush likely to appoint bolton during congressional recess bush appoints john bolton united states ambassador to the united nations on august   bush officially made a recess appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr bolton but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the united nations term at the unedit the economist called bolton the most controversial ambassador ever sent by america to the united nations some colleagues in the un appreciated the goals bolton was trying to achieve but not his abrasive style the new york times in its editorial the shame of the united nations praised boltons stance on reforming the disgraceful united nations human rights commission saying john bolton is right secretarygeneral kofi annan is wrong the times also said that the commission at that time was composed of some of the worlds most abusive regimes who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the human rights commission the un human rights council as not going far enough for reform saying we want a butterfly we dont intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success  nominationedit bush announced his intention to renominate bolton for confirmation as un ambassador at the beginning of  and a new confirmation hearing was held on july   in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of boltons recess appointment at the end of the th congress voinovich who had previously stood in opposition to bolton had amended his views and determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february  he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked – and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november   immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the th congress to the democratic party chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for on december   bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december   effective when his recess appointment ended december  at the formal adjournment of the th congress the announcement was characterized as boltons resignation by the associated press united press international abc news and other news sources as well as a white house press release and president bush himself the white house however later objected to the use of this language deputy press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step down to leave or to exit support for boltonedit during his confirmation hearings in  letters with signatures of more than  coworkers and professional colleagues were sent to senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in praise of bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff in late  when his nomination was again before the committee another letter signed by more than  professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to senator lugar a wall street journal op ed by claudia rosett on december   said in part bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up un corruption and malfeasance and follow un procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear north korea a hezbollah bid to take over lebanon and the nuclearization of hezbollahs terrormasters in iran but it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud american enterprise instituteedit john bolton in  after leaving the george w bush administration bolton returned to the american enterprise institute for public policy research as a senior fellow with research areas in foreign policy and international organizations in boltons time at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank he spoke against the policy of rewarding north korea for ending its nuclear weapons program he said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear nonproliferation rules so that they could then be rewarded for following the rules theyd already agreed to on three episodes of fox news in may and june  bolton suggested that israel might attack iran after us elections in novembercitation needed in january  bolton proposed a threestate solution to the arab israeli conflict in which gaza is returned to egyptian control and the west bank in some configuration reverts to jordanian sovereignty on july   john bolton was appointed to the board of directors for ems technologies inc elmg a georgiabased tech company that subcontracts for many dod contractorscitation needed he is a frequent guest on the fox news channel criticism of the obama administrationedit john bolton spoke on foreign policy challenges for the obama administration at chatham house in  bolton likened the president to æthelred the unready the turn of the first millennium anglosaxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful effort to buy off viking raiders made him historys paradigmatic weak leader in an interview with the los angeles times bolton contended that obamas efforts on international issues are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it john bolton caused a controversy on december   when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september   that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a diplomatic illness and this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band in  he wrote a foreword for the book the postamerican presidency the obama administration’s war on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer bolton endorsed their book writing this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing still peoples mujahedin of iranedit bolton has spoken in favor of the peoples mujahedin of iran also known as the mujahedine khalq or mek an armed islamic group with marxist leanings which has long been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam in the s mek members who had been trained by the soviet union in guerilla warfare and supported khomeini  assassinated us military officers then working in iran mek members actively took part in the  seizure of the us embassy in tehran according to a us government report according to conservative activist kenneth timmerman executive director of the foundation for democracy in iran iranianamericans openly refer to mek leader massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents on january   bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts  decision in holder v humanitarian law project however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in  and the usa in  presidential considerationedit edit john bolton speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february   bolton considered running for president in the  us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in  republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state on january   bolton endorsed mitt romney for the  republican nomination edit bolton considered running in the  us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in  my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may   in a video message posted from twitter on wednesday september   freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on international security financial and political risks possible trump administration positionedit in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt during the  us presidential campaign republican nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december   bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state candidate for the incoming trump administration several trump associates claim bolton was not chosen in part due to trumps disdain for boltons signature mustache the evening of december  the bbc cited nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were  saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december  bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in  may have been a “false flag” operation however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t flynn the position ultimately went to h r mcmaster trump made a point on monday of praising mr bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually referencesedit

successful in pushing his agenda but his bluntness has won him many enemies irans foreign ministry has called bolton rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work

leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of

troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the

nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign

solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview

record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the

bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also

key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson

america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work on may   at the hay festival of literature  arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security

journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of highlevel contacts permanent representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign relation committee staff townsel detailed her accusations against bolton which were confirmed by canadian designer uno ramat who had served as an ibtci employee and one of townsels aid colleagues time magazine among other publications verified townsels accusations and ramats supporting testimony and townsels story was transcribed and entered into the official senate committee record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the democrats filibusteredit on may   senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination accusations of false statementedit on july   it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation recess appointmentedit

appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr

determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february  he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked – and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november   immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the th congress to the democratic party chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for on december   bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december   effective when his recess appointment ended december  at the formal adjournment of the th congress the announcement was characterized as boltons resignation by the associated press united press international abc news and other news sources as well as a white house press release and president bush himself the white house however later objected to the use of this language deputy press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step down to leave or to exit support for boltonedit during his confirmation hearings in  letters with signatures of more than  coworkers and professional colleagues were sent to senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in praise of bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff in late  when his nomination was again before the committee another letter signed by more than  professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to senator lugar a

research areas in foreign policy and international organizations in boltons time at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank he spoke against the policy of rewarding north korea for

administrationedit john bolton spoke on foreign policy challenges for the obama administration at chatham house in  bolton likened the president to æthelred the unready the turn of the first millennium anglosaxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful effort to buy off viking raiders made him historys paradigmatic weak leader in an interview with the los angeles times bolton contended that obamas efforts on international issues are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it john bolton caused a controversy on december   when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september   that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or

on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer bolton endorsed their book writing this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing

been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam in the s mek members who had been

massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents on january   bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts  decision in holder v humanitarian law project however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in  and the usa in  presidential considerationedit edit john bolton speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february   bolton considered running for president in the  us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in  republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state on january   bolton endorsed mitt romney for the  republican nomination edit bolton considered running in the  us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in  my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may   in a video message posted from twitter on wednesday september   freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on

nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december   bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state

nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were  saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december  bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in  may have been a “false flag” operation however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t

individuals or groups profiled on this site   john bolton is a senior fellow at the neoconservative american enterprise institute and the chairman of the gatestone institute a rightwing “proisrael” activist group that has been accused of fomenting antimuslim sentiment a longtime national security hawk bolton is a former board member of the project for the new american century and a past adviser to the jewish institute for national security affairs he is a frequent contributor to fox news the wall street journal the washington times the weekly standard and other rightwing media outlets bolton has been a key republican party figure for decades he was tapped to serve in the reagan administration in the s where he held a series of posts at usaid before joining a team of federalist society lawyers under attorney general edwin meese he later worked in several highlevel positions in the george w bush administration including as the state department’s chief diplomat on arms control and as the us ambassador to the united nations during the  election campaign bolton broke with other neoconservative pundits likes robert kagan in praising donald trump‘s foreign policy positions he commended trump for saying that islamic militants are waging an “ideological war” on the west for calling the planned withdrawal of troops from iraq as “reckless” and for urging more military action against isis shortly after trump’s election press accounts reported that bolton was being “eyed” by trump for secretary of state he subsequently became a contender to replace the controversial retired gen michael flynn who was forced out of his position as national security adviser nsa only weeks after trump’s inauguration because of his controversial contacts with russian officials the idea of bolton as nsa overwhelming opposed by democrats divided republicans with the hawkish sen ted cruz rtx pushing the candidacy and libertarian sen rand paul rky calling him a “bad choice” who could end

calling for bombing the country’s nuclear facilities supporting the invasion of iraq and opposing major arms control agreements he has long dismissed the legitimacy of the united nations and other international institutions in part because of his desire to free us military force from any international constraints bolton once declared “if the un secretary building in new york lost ten stories it wouldn’t make a bit of difference” he dismisses international treaties as nonbinding “political obligations” and was a leading opponent of the international criminal court which he once claimed would turn the “senior civilian and military leaders responsible for our defense and foreign policy” into “potential targets of the politically unaccountable prosecutor in rome” presidential aspirations bolton’s recent involvement in politics has included serving as a foreign policy surrogate for the  mitt romneypaul ryan presidential campaign as an informal adviser to  presidential candidate sen ted cruz rtx and repeatedly suggesting that he will run for president in october  he launched an eponymous pac and super pac anointing them with a mission to “seek out and support candidates for nomination and election to federal office who are committed to restoring strong american national security policies” seeking to roll back an increasing libertarian influence on the gop’s foreign policy bolton said in a statement that “we must be prepared to do what it takes to protect the idea of american exceptionalism and our basic constitutional priorities—the preservation of which are essential not only to our security but to our prosperity as well” bolton’s pac and superpac raised a total of  million during the  midterm elections and contributed to the campaigns of  senate and house candidates the pacs made contributions to republican candidates who espoused aggressive foreign policy positions and sponsored numerous hawkish online advertisements the advertisements were described as “customized national security messages intended to sway distinct clusters of swing voters” relying on tactics such as positing that “president obama is a better strategist for aiding isis than eliminating it” bolton was mentioned in an april  new york times piece that examined why republicans are “more fervently proisrael than ever” the article linked such sentiment to being “partly a result of ideology but also a product of a surge in donations and campaign spending on their behalf by a small group of wealthy donors” the piece revealed how bolton’s pac is partly financed by “major proisrael donors” like irving moskowitz and that it “spent at least ” to support the successful  senate bid of tom cotton ral in february  bolton launched the foundation for american security and freedom fasf an advocacy organization that describes itself as “committed to restoring and protecting our vital national security interests and preserving our way of life for our children” fasf states on its website that it aims to “strengthen our public discourse making clear the inextricable links between strong foreign and domestic national policies” the conservative breitbart reported of fasf’s launch “the staunchly proamerican diplomat explained that the fasf was designed to help america avoid the mistake of electing a president who doesn’t care that much about america’s national security as it did when electing barack obama in  and ” in august  fasf ran a tv ad attacking comments made sen rand paul rky about a hypothetical iranian nuclear weapon the ad featured an american family happily sitting down to dinner when suddenly a presumably nuclear explosion occurs the ad then transitions to a speech where paul states that us “national security is not threatened by iran having one nuclear weapon” the ad ended with the caption “it only takes one a nuclear iran is a threat to our national security” bolton was rumored for a time to be considering a bid for president in  and he made visits in  to early primary states as part of what journalist robert costa described as “an informal national tour” to “give speeches huddle with gop leaders and push back against the party’s libertarian shift he’ll make the case for a muscular foreign policy” in may  however bolton ruled out running “while i’m not a candidate i am certainly not going to sit this election out” bolton said in statement “i’m also going to focus on the  presidential race to make certain that foreign policy is critical to winning the nomination” bolton had previously considered running in  a move he ultimately decided against even as he hinted that he viewed himself as the only “ideal conservative” in the race “i hope he runs” said msnbc’s chris matthews at the time “to remind the country of what everybody voted against in  and  and the ideology that led us into attacking a country that never attacked us an ideology that wants to make some sort of permanent garrison in the middle east” in the obama era bolton is a prolific commentator on foreign affairs he has been among the obama administration’s most strident critics particularly on middle east issues and has repeatedly accused the obama white house of “weakness” and “fecklessness” bolton is a particularly vocal proponent of the claim that iran is developing nuclear weapons despite us intelligence judgments to the contrary and has accused the obama administration of enabling tehran by engaging with it diplomatically “by negotiating with iran” bolton wrote in april  obama “has not only allowed it a path to legitimize its nuclearweapons program but objectively facilitated the deadly global menace in tehran” while nuclear negotiations between iran and the united states were ongoing in late  bolton insisted that “iran’s nuclearweapons and ballisticmissile programs will proceed unimpeded in unknown undisclosed locations” bolton later added that “we shouldn’t trust and can’t verify iranian promises not to fabricate nuclear weapons” concluding that “we have only two very unpleasant choices either iran gets nuclear weapons in the very near future or preemptive military force fully justified by wellestablished principles of selfdefense must break iran’s control over the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent or at least substantially delay weaponization” bolton says that that iran should not be permitted to have an indigenous uranium enrichment program “the right amount is zero iran should not be permitted to conduct any nuclearrelated activity as long as the ayatollahs remain in power given their record of dissimulation and obstructionism and their obvious intention of becoming a nuclearweapons state” he wrote in september  in a march  oped for the new york times published just before iran and the p reached a political framework agreement over iran’s nuclear program bolton explicitly called for military strikes against iran titled “to stop iran’s bomb bomb iran” bolton’s oped claimed “president obama’s approach on iran has brought a bad situation to the brink of catastrophe” bolton further asserted that “the inconvenient truth is that only military action like israel’s  attack on saddam hussein’s osirak reactor in iraq or its  destruction of a syrian reactor designed and built by north korea can accomplish what is required” he added “the united states could do a thorough job of destruction but israel alone can do what’s necessary such action should be combined with vigorous american support for iran’s opposition aimed at regime change in tehran” responded sally kohn of the daily beast  “would that be the same evidence you relied on to assert that saddam hussein was developing wmds—the same intel the bush administration used as the justification for going to war in iraq bolton provides little solid evidence of his skyisfalling assertions we’re just supposed to trust him i guess based on his reputation” after iran and the p group of nations reached a comprehensive nuclear agreement in july  bolton vociferously denounced it and reiterated his call for us military action against iran “obama’s deal is a born failure for reasons we need not elaborate further here” he wrote in an august  oped for the conservative national review “accordingly as of today only a preemptive military strike can block iran from becoming a nuclearweapons state” bolton then expressed support for israel launching a military attack on iran’s nuclear facilities and stated that the united states should support if it does so in  speaking before an audience at the university of chicago bolton suggested that israel should consider a nuclear strike against iran and chastised the obama administration’s position that iran could be deterred from using nuclear weapons as “a dangerously weak approach” bolton declared “we’re at a very unhappy point—a very unhappy point—where unless israel is prepared to use nuclear weapons against iran’s program iran will have nuclear weapons in the very near future” commented inter press service blogger daniel luban “an israeli strike nuclear or otherwise without us permission remains unlikely but as is often the case i suspect that bolton’s intention is less to give an accurate description of reality than it is to stake out positions extreme enough to shift the boundaries of debate as a whole to the right” bolton has also been critical of the obama administration’s position on syria writing in september  that obama had “failed in his stated objective to oust syria’s assad regime from power failed to impress assad that his ‘red line’ against using chemical weapons was serious failed to exact retribution when that red line was crossed failed to rally anything but small minorities in either house of congress to support his position and failed to grasp that agreements with the likes of syria and russia prolong rather than solve the chemicalweapons problem”yet bolton later said that he himself “would vote against an authorization to use force here” adding “i don’t think it is in america’s interest i don’t think we should in effect take sides in the syrian conflict” in april  bolton called the syrian civil war a “strategic sideshow” and wrote that the united states should instead be preparing for war with iran “the assad regime loathsome as it is couldn’t survive without substantial iranian assistance” bolton wrote “and it is iran through its pursuit of nuclear weapons and its decadeslong role as international terrorism’s central banker which poses the central danger instead of focusing on overthrowing assad or aiding his enemies we should be vigorously pursuing regime change in iran” bolton accused iran of “relentlessly” pursuing a nuclear weapon despite evidence that tehran had reduced its stockpile of enriched uranium in accordance with an interim agreement it had made with international negotiators earlier that year after russia’s decision in october  to bolster its military presence in syria and launch airstrikes against syrian rebel groups bolton stated in a washington times piece that the united states should pursue the goal of defeating isis and forming a new state in the territory of syria and iraq currently controlled by isis calling for a “forceful usled effort to destroy isis” that excludes russia and iran bolton stated that “our objective should be a new sunni state where isis now rules carved from iraq and syria one that is either democratic or led to paraphrase franklin roosevelt by one of our sob’s” he also added that “sooner or later we should recognize the reality that an independent kurdistan now exists even if not declared de jure” in a november  new york times oped bolton reiterated his call for an independent “sunni state” to be formed out of syrian and iraqi territory stating it “could be a bulwark against both mr assad and iranallied baghdad” bolton is a steadfast supporter of the rightwing israeli government of prime minister benjamin netanyahu and like many members of netanyahu’s cabinet an opponent of palestinian statehood claiming that it “would inevitably lead to a terrorist state on the other side of the border with israel” bolton has fervently criticized the obama administration for seeking a twostate solution to the israelipalestinian conflict instead bolton has echoed the arguments of some israeli nationalists that the palestinian territories of the west bank and gaza—which he called “bits and pieces of the collapsed ottoman empire” with “no particular history either of national identity or of economic interdependence”—should be ceded respectively to jordan and egypt rather than incorporated into an independent palestinian territory “the only logic underlying the demand for a palestinian state” bolton has claimed “is the political imperative of israel’s opponents to weaken and encircle the jewish state thereby minimizing its potential to establish secure and defensible borders” bolton has also been a defender of israeli aggression against its neighbors in late  bolton joined a chorus of neoconservative voices—including un watch and the atlantic’s jeffrey goldberg—in attacking the un human rights council’s “goldstone report” which detailed war crimes committed by israel as well as hamas during israel’s  invasion of the gaza strip bolton called the report’s conclusion that israel had targeted civilians in gaza an attempt “to criminalize israel’s strategy of crippling hamas” bolton’s comments echoed earlier remarks he had made about israel’s  invasion of lebanon when he said there was “no moral equivalence” between lebanese civilian casualties of israeli bombing and israelis killed by “malicious terrorist acts” bolton has also remained unapologetic about the us war in iraq “despite all the criticism of what happened after saddam’s defeat” he argued in february  it is “indisputable” that the usled coalition “accomplished its military mission with low casualties and great speed sending an unmistakable signal of power and determination throughout the middle east and around the world” dismissing critics who said the war was unnecessary or disproportionate bolton claimed that saddam hussein “would have immediately returned to ambitious wmd programs” in the absence of international action adding that if anything the united states should have toppled hussein in  and then immediately “turned its attention to the regimes in iran and syria” bolton quipped that anyone who claims that iraqis were better off under hussein than they were in the tumultuous decade that followed his ouster must have “a propensity to admire totalitarianism” but in any case “the issue was never about making life better for iraqis but about ensuring a safer world for america and its allies” invoking world war ii bolton added “we didn’t wage war after pearl harbor to do nationbuilding for our enemies” after the november  paris attacks bolton called for more leeway to be given to us intelligence agencies “we need a more sensible national conversation about the need for effective intelligence gathering to uncover and prevent such tragedies before they occur” he opined in a fox news oped “kneejerk uninformed and often wildly inaccurate criticisms of programs such as several authorized in the wake of  in the patriot act have created a widespread misimpression in the american public about what exactly our intelligence agencies have been doing and whether there was a ‘threat’ to civil liberties” he added “now is the time to correct these misimpressions” bolton has also struck a hardline on the south china sea territorial dispute between china and several of its neighbors in october  after a us military ship sailed through waters claimed by china in the south china sea bolton declared “if we are going to do this in a serious way we have to have more ships in the water” he heaped criticism on the obama administration for sending the single ship telling the conservative newsmax that he is “worried the white house may have not thought the action through completely because ‘if we get in a situation where the chinese crowd our ships and impede their passage and there is a collision at sea what do we do then’” in the bush administration in the aftermath of the  presidential election bolton worked in collaboration with his former boss james baker to block recount efforts in florida according to the wall street journal after the us supreme court ordered a halt to the recount bolton entered a venue where the count was still taking place and declared “i’m with the bushcheney team and i’m here to stop the count” this marked bolton’s entrée into the administration of george w bush at the time vice presidentelect dick cheney commented “people ask what job john should get my answer is anything he wants” as undersecretary of state representing the administration in various international fora bolton gained a reputation as an arrogant and hawkish unilateralist willing to redefine us positions in the global arena diplomatic consequences notwithstanding in an exemplary display of what the wall street journal described as his “combative style” bolton warned an international conference on bioweapons that a hotly disputed verification proposal widely supported by arms control experts was “dead dead dead and i don’t want it coming back from the dead” among bolton’s more notable actions during this period was withdrawing the united states from the  antiballistic missile treaty this bilateral treaty with the soviet union was the bedrock of efforts to reduce nuclear brinksmanship but bolton dismissed it as a relic that impeded the development of a us national missile defense system also significant was bolton’s effort to block progress on the comprehensive test ban treaty viewed as a cornerstone of the global nonproliferation regime bolton was also given the task of officially rescinding the us signature on the treaty that established the international criminal court which he later called “the happiest moment in my government service” bolton was a key proponent within the bush administration of taking military action against the socalled “axis of evil” or countries identified by the bush administration as “rogue state” rivals of the united states two months before the iraq invasion bolton met with israeli prime minister ariel sharon to discuss strategies for “preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction” focusing on the bush administration’s disarmament targets following the planned invasion of iraq shortly after the visit bolton said once regime change in iraq is complete “it will be necessary to deal with threats from syria iran and north korea” speaking before an audience at the heritage foundation in may  bolton argued that cuba should also be included among the “axis of evil” countries because of its alleged development of biowarfare capacity cuba is worldrenowned for its biomedical industry but bolton claimed that the industry was concealing a wmd project providing no evidence he insisted that cuba was involved in the sales of illicit biowarfare technology as a way to boost its cashshort economy other administration officials declined to support bolton’s accusations a congressional investigation of cuba’s alleged wmd program found no evidence supporting bolton’s assertions bolton was also one of the administration’s leading hawks on asia policy and one if its strongest advocates of taiwan according to a  washington post investigation bolton had been on the payroll of the taiwanese government before joining the bush administration bolton also received  for “research papers on un membership issues involving taiwan” at the same time he was promoting diplomatic recognition of taiwan before various congressional committees “diplomatic recognition of taiwan would be just the kind of demonstration of us leadership that the region needs and that many of its people hope for” wrote bolton in a  weekly standard article “the notion that china would actually respond with force is a fantasy” bolton’s penchant for intemperate statements often compromised his work as a diplomat in july  during the runup to the sixparty talks with north korea bolton characterized north korean president kim jong il as the “tyrannical dictator” of a country where “life is a hellish nightmare” north korea responded in kind saying that “such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks … we have decided not to consider him as an official of the us administration any longer nor to deal with him” the state department had to send a replacement for bolton to the talks after condoleezza rice became us secretary of state at the outset of bush’s second term bolton expressed an interest in becoming deputy secretary of state however rice selected bolton as ambassador to the un “thus appointing to this unique post the us official most publicly contemptuous of the world organization” wrote brian urquhart bolton served as un ambassador from august —when president bush gave him a recess appointment after the senate blocked his nomination—to january  his resignation announced in december  came at the end of a controversial tenure marked by severe criticism from us senators and international diplomats his resignation also came less than three weeks after president bush resubmitted bolton’s nomination for senate confirmation—the second time in six months during his first confirmation hearings bolton’s record as undersecretary of state came under intense criticism particularly regarding his contacts with israel according to the forward and other news sources bolton had met with officials of israel’s intelligence agency the mossad without first seeking “country clearance” from the state department there was enormous domestic and international opposition to bolton’s nomination in late july  the new york times reported deep scorn for bolton among un ambassadors according to the times “many diplomats say they see mr bolton as a standin for the arrogance of the administration itself” rather than furthering his stated mission of un reform according to the times “envoys say he has in fact endangered that effort by alienating traditional allies they say he combatively asserts american leadership contests procedures at the mannerly rulesbound united nations and then shrugs off the organization when it does not follow his lead” one unnamed un ambassador “with close ties” to the administration said “he’s lost me as an ally now and that’s what many other ambassadors who consider themselves friends of the united states are saying” one of bolton’s more controversial acts as ambassador came in  when he sabotaged efforts to complete a joint un declaration in connection with the organization’s th anniversary according to brian urquhart “un delegations including the united states and the secretariat had for the previous six months been working on this document which originally contained a fairly ambitious mixture of global objectives and un reform proposals bolton’s seven hundred or so amendments designed he believed to increase the influence and reflect the interests of the united states caused considerable confusion and resentment and reopened many disagreements that had previously been resolved among other things he insisted that there be no mention of the millennium development goals to eradicate global poverty which the us had supported in  condoleezza rice overruled bolton on this at the last minute bolton also insisted on the elimination of any mention of the comprehensive test ban treaty the icc and global warming” in accepting bolton’s resignation in december  bush blamed a “handful” of senators who were determined to block a full senate vote on the nomination bolton himself asserted that his resignation was not about his policies or performance but about “whether i was a nice person thereby inviting every person in government whom i had ever defeated in a policy battle of whom there were many to turn the issue into one of personal disparagement” controversies bolton has been closely associated both in and out of government with a number of political and financial controversies as an assistant attorney general under edwin meese bolton thwarted the kerry commission’s efforts to obtain documentation including bolton’s personal notes about the irancontra affair and alleged contra drug smuggling working with congressional republicans bolton also stonewalled congressional demands to interview meese’s deputies regarding their role in the affair in  as an associate at the highpowered covington law firm bolton worked with sen jesse helms rnc and the national congressional club the senator’s campaignfinancing organization to help form a new campaign finance organization called jefferson marketing according to the legal times jefferson marketing was established “as a vehicle to supply candidates with such services as advertising and direct mail without having to worry about the federal laws preventing pacs like the congressional club from contributing more than  per election to any one candidate’s campaign committee” after its formation jefferson marketing became a holding company for three firms—campaign management inc computer operations  mailing professionals and discount paper brokers in  the national congressional club reported a debt of  its major creditors were richard viguerie charles black jr covington and burling and the dc law office of baker  hostetler—all of which maintained good relations with the rightwing pac despite its failure to pay jefferson marketing was the congressional club’s largest creditor with more than  owed by the end of the decade fec documents showed that helms’ pac owed covington  but this was not considered a major concern for covington according to firm spokesman h edward dunkelberger jr a decade later bolton was again entangled in controversial schemes to support republican candidates this time involving money channeled from hong kong and taiwan via a “think tank” linked to the republican national committee rnc in  bolton served as president of the national policy forum npf which according to a congressional investigation functioned as an intermediary organization to funnel foreign and corporate money to republicans the npf had been established in  in anticipation of the  general election founded by thenrnc chair haley barbour the forum was organized as a nonprofit taxexempt education institute although the irs later ruled that as a subsidiary of the rnc npf was not entitled to taxexempt status a  congressional investigation brought to light the role of the npf which reportedly channeled  in foreign money into the  election cycle—after having used similar tactics to fund congressional races in  when bolton became npf president in  the forum began organizing “megaconferences” with a fundraising hook these events brought together republican members of congress lobbyists and corporate executives to discuss matters that were frequently the object of pending legislation an npf memo laid out the funding strategy “npf will continue to recruit new donors through conference sponsorships … in order for the conferences to take place they must pay for themselves or turn a profit industry and association leaders will be recruited to participate and sponsor those forums starting at ”corporate representatives professed surprise at the size of the contribution requests “it’s pretty astounding” said one invitee “if this doesn’t have ‘payment for access’ to top gop lawmakers written all over it i don’t know what does” in another npf memo two npf employees told bolton that in return for a  donation by us west the telecommunications company should be assured its top policy issues would be incorporated into the agenda for npf’s upcoming telecommunications “megaconference” bolton left his position at the npf shortly before congress launched its probe into whether the group illegally accepted foreign contributions no

demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer

president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of

bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political

not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power

the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate

delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci

other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the

bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also

key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson

from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with

negotiating with many countries to sign agreements called article  agreements with the us to exempt americans from prosecution by the court which is not recognized by the us more than  countries have signed such agreements bolton said the decision to pull out of the icc was the happiest moment of his political career to date weapons of mass destructionedit bolton was instrumental in derailing a  biological weapons conference in geneva convened to endorse a un proposal to enforce the  biological weapons convention us officials led by bolton argued that the plan would have put us national security at risk by allowing spot inspections of suspected us weapons sites despite the fact that the us claims not to have carried out any research for offensive purposes since  also in  bolton is said to have flown to europe to demand the resignation of jose bustani head of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session

threat reduction program to halt the proliferation of nuclear materials at the same time he was involved in the implementation of the proliferation security initiative working with a number of

successful in pushing his agenda but his bluntness has won him many enemies irans foreign ministry has called bolton rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work on may   at the hay festival of literature  arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security personnel in june  bolton dismissed palestinian claims to statehood as a ploy in july  bolton was identified as a key member of groundswell a secretive coalition of right wing activists and journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of highlevel contacts permanent representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign relation committee staff townsel detailed her accusations against bolton which were confirmed by canadian designer uno ramat who had served as an ibtci employee and one of townsels aid colleagues time magazine among other publications verified townsels accusations and ramats supporting testimony and townsels story was transcribed and entered into the official senate committee record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the democrats filibusteredit on may   senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination accusations of false statementedit on july   it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation recess appointmentedit wikinews has related news bush likely to appoint bolton during congressional recess bush appoints john bolton united states ambassador to the united nations on august   bush officially made a recess appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr bolton but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the united nations term at the unedit the economist called bolton the most controversial ambassador ever sent by america to the united nations some colleagues in the un appreciated the goals bolton was trying to achieve but not his abrasive style the new york times in its editorial the shame of the united nations praised boltons stance on reforming the disgraceful united nations human rights commission saying john bolton is right secretarygeneral kofi annan is wrong the times also said that the commission at that time was composed of some of the worlds most abusive regimes who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the human rights commission the un human rights council as not going far enough for reform saying we want a butterfly we dont intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success  nominationedit bush announced his intention to renominate bolton for confirmation as un ambassador at the beginning of  and a new confirmation hearing was held on july   in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of boltons recess appointment at the end of the th congress voinovich who had previously stood in opposition to bolton had amended his views and determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february  he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked – and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november   immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the th congress to the democratic party chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for on december   bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december   effective when his recess appointment ended december  at the formal adjournment of the th congress the announcement was characterized as boltons resignation by the associated press united press international abc news and other news sources as well as a white house press release and president bush himself the white house however later objected to the use of this language deputy press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step down to leave or to exit support for boltonedit during his confirmation hearings in  letters with signatures of more than  coworkers and professional colleagues were sent to senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in praise of bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff in late  when his nomination was again before the committee another letter signed by more than  professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to senator lugar a wall street journal op ed by claudia rosett on december   said in part bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up un corruption and malfeasance and follow un procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear north korea a hezbollah bid to take over lebanon and the nuclearization of hezbollahs terrormasters in iran but it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud american enterprise instituteedit john bolton in  after leaving the george w bush administration bolton returned to the american enterprise institute for public policy research as a senior fellow with research areas in foreign policy and international organizations in boltons time at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank he spoke against the policy of rewarding north korea for ending its nuclear weapons program he said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear nonproliferation rules so that they could then be rewarded for following the rules theyd already agreed to on three episodes of fox news in may and june  bolton suggested that israel might attack iran after us elections in novembercitation needed in january  bolton proposed a threestate solution to the arab israeli conflict in which gaza is returned to egyptian control and the west bank in some configuration reverts to jordanian sovereignty on july   john bolton was appointed to the board of directors for ems technologies inc elmg a georgiabased tech company that subcontracts for many dod contractorscitation needed he is a frequent guest on the fox news channel criticism of the obama administrationedit john bolton spoke on foreign policy challenges for the obama administration at chatham house in  bolton likened the president to æthelred the unready the turn of the first millennium anglosaxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful effort to buy off viking raiders made him historys paradigmatic weak leader in an interview with the los angeles times bolton contended that obamas efforts on international issues are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it john bolton caused a controversy on december   when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september   that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a diplomatic illness and this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band in  he wrote a foreword for the book the postamerican presidency the obama administration’s war on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer bolton endorsed their book writing this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing still peoples mujahedin of iranedit bolton has spoken in favor of the peoples mujahedin of iran also known as the mujahedine khalq or mek an armed islamic group with marxist leanings which has long been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam in the s mek members who had been trained by the soviet union in guerilla warfare and supported khomeini  assassinated us military officers then working in iran mek members actively took part in the  seizure of the us embassy in tehran according to a us government report according to conservative activist kenneth timmerman executive director of the foundation for democracy in iran iranianamericans openly refer to mek leader massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents on january   bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts  decision in holder v humanitarian law project however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in  and the usa in  presidential considerationedit edit john bolton speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february   bolton considered running for president in the  us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in  republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state on january   bolton endorsed mitt romney for the  republican nomination edit bolton considered running in the  us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in  my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may   in a video message posted from twitter on wednesday september   freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on international security financial and political risks possible trump administration positionedit in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt during the  us presidential campaign republican nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december   bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state candidate for the incoming trump administration several trump associates claim bolton was not chosen in part due to trumps disdain for boltons signature mustache the evening of december  the bbc cited nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were  saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december  bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in  may have been a “false flag” operation however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t flynn the position ultimately went to h r mcmaster trump made a point on monday of praising mr bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually referencesedit

us to exempt americans from prosecution by the court which is not recognized by the us more than  countries have signed such agreements bolton said the decision to pull out of the icc was the happiest moment of his political career to date weapons of mass destructionedit bolton was instrumental in derailing a  biological weapons conference in geneva convened to endorse a un proposal to enforce the  biological weapons convention us officials led by bolton argued that the plan would have put us national security at risk by allowing spot inspections of suspected us weapons sites despite the fact that the us claims not to have carried out any research for offensive purposes since  also in  bolton is said to have flown to europe to demand the resignation of jose bustani head of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons opcw and to have orchestrated his removal at a special session of the organization the united nations highest administrative tribunal later condemned the action

called bolton rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work on may   at the hay festival of literature  arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security personnel in june  bolton dismissed palestinian claims to statehood as a ploy in july  bolton was identified as a key member of groundswell a secretive coalition of right wing activists and journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of highlevel contacts permanent representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign relation committee staff townsel detailed her accusations against bolton which were confirmed by canadian designer uno ramat who had served as an ibtci employee and one of townsels aid colleagues time magazine among other publications verified townsels accusations and ramats supporting testimony and townsels story was transcribed and entered into the official senate committee record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the democrats filibusteredit on may   senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination accusations of false statementedit on july   it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation recess appointmentedit wikinews has related news bush likely to appoint bolton during congressional recess bush appoints john bolton united states ambassador to the united nations on august   bush officially made a recess appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr bolton but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the united nations term at the unedit the economist called bolton the most controversial ambassador ever sent by america to the united nations some colleagues in the un appreciated the goals bolton was trying to achieve but not his abrasive style the new york times in its editorial the shame of the united nations praised boltons stance on reforming the disgraceful united nations human rights commission saying john bolton is right secretarygeneral kofi annan is wrong the times also said that the commission at that time was composed of some of the worlds most abusive regimes who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the human rights commission the un human rights council as not going far enough for reform saying we want a butterfly we dont intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success  nominationedit bush announced his intention to renominate bolton for confirmation as un ambassador at the beginning of  and a new confirmation hearing was held on july   in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of boltons recess appointment at the end of the th congress voinovich who had previously stood in opposition to bolton had amended his views and determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february  he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked – and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november   immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the th congress to the democratic party chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for on december   bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december   effective when his recess appointment ended december  at the formal adjournment of the th congress the announcement was characterized as boltons resignation by the associated press united press international abc news and other news sources as well as a white house press release and president bush himself the white house however later objected to the use of this language deputy press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step down to leave or to exit support for boltonedit during his confirmation hearings in  letters with signatures of more than  coworkers and professional colleagues were sent to senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in praise of bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff in late  when his nomination was again before the committee another letter signed by more than  professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to senator lugar a wall street journal op ed by claudia rosett on december   said in part bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up un corruption and malfeasance and follow un procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear north korea a hezbollah bid to take over lebanon and the nuclearization of hezbollahs terrormasters in iran but it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud american enterprise instituteedit john bolton in  after leaving the george w bush administration bolton returned to the american enterprise institute for public policy research as a senior fellow with research areas in foreign policy and international organizations in boltons time at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank he spoke against the policy of rewarding north korea for ending its nuclear weapons program he said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear nonproliferation rules so that they could then be rewarded for following the rules theyd already agreed to on three episodes of fox news in may and june  bolton suggested that israel might attack iran after us elections in novembercitation needed in january  bolton proposed a threestate solution to the arab israeli conflict in which gaza is returned to egyptian control and the west bank in some configuration reverts to jordanian sovereignty on july   john bolton was appointed to the board of directors for ems technologies inc elmg a georgiabased tech company that subcontracts for many dod contractorscitation needed he is a frequent guest on the fox news channel criticism of the obama administrationedit john bolton spoke on foreign policy challenges for the obama administration at chatham house in  bolton likened the president to æthelred the unready the turn of the first millennium anglosaxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful effort to buy off viking raiders made him historys paradigmatic weak leader in an interview with the los angeles times bolton contended that obamas efforts on international issues are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it john bolton caused a controversy on december   when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september   that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a diplomatic illness and this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band in  he wrote a foreword for the book the postamerican presidency the obama administration’s war on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer bolton endorsed their book writing this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing still peoples mujahedin of iranedit bolton has spoken in favor of the peoples mujahedin of iran also known as the mujahedine khalq or mek an armed islamic group with marxist leanings which has long been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam in the s mek members who had been trained by the soviet union in guerilla warfare and supported khomeini  assassinated us military officers then working in iran mek members actively took part in the  seizure of the us embassy in tehran according to a us government report according to conservative activist kenneth timmerman executive director of the foundation for democracy in iran iranianamericans openly refer to mek leader massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents on january   bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts  decision in holder v humanitarian law project however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in  and the usa in  presidential considerationedit edit john bolton speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february   bolton considered running for president in the  us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in  republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state on january   bolton endorsed mitt romney for the  republican nomination edit bolton considered running in the  us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in  my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may   in a video message posted from twitter on wednesday september   freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on international security financial and political risks possible trump administration positionedit in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt during the  us presidential campaign republican nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december   bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state candidate for the incoming trump administration several trump associates claim bolton was not chosen in part due to trumps disdain for boltons signature mustache the evening of december  the bbc cited nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were  saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december  bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in  may have been a “false flag” operation however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t flynn the position ultimately went to h r mcmaster trump made a point on monday of praising mr bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually referencesedit  jennifer senior january   bolton in a

from prosecution by the court which is not recognized by the us more than  countries have signed such agreements bolton said the decision to pull out of the icc was the happiest moment of his political career to date weapons of mass destructionedit bolton was instrumental in derailing a  biological weapons conference in geneva convened to endorse a un proposal to enforce the  biological weapons convention us officials led by bolton argued that the plan would have put us national security at risk by allowing spot inspections of suspected us weapons sites despite the fact that the us claims not to have carried out any research for offensive purposes since  also in  bolton is said to have flown to europe to demand the resignation of jose bustani head of the organization for the

weapons diplomacyedit according to an article in the new republic bolton was highly successful in pushing his agenda but his bluntness has won him many enemies irans foreign ministry has called bolton rude and undiplomatic in response to critics bolton states that his record demonstrates clear support for effective multilateral diplomacy bush administration officials have stated that his past statements would allow him to negotiate from a powerful position its like the palestinians having to negotiate with israeli prime minister ariel sharon if you have a deal you know you have a deal an anonymous official told cnn he also won widespread praise for his work establishing the proliferation security initiative a voluntary agreement supported by  countries bolton spawned controversy when in a speech cleared by the state department he described north korean leader kim jongil as a tyrannical dictator and saying that for north koreans under kims rule life is a hellish nightmare in response a north korean spokesman said such human scum and bloodsucker is not entitled to take part in the talks congressional democrats argued that boltons words at the time were undiplomatic and endangered the talks bolton later wrote that he had been looking for a hammer to shatter the clinton administrations  agreed framework with north korea an implement he found when the countrys uranium enrichment program came to light critics argued that boltons record of allegedly politicizing intelligence would harm us credibility with the united nations president bush said he wanted john bolton because he can get the job done at the united nations bolton recalls that his happiest moment at state was personally unsigning the rome statute which had set up the international criminal court criticismedit in  bolton accused cuba of transfers of biological weapons technology to rogue states and called on it to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention according to a scripps howard news service article bolton wanted to say that cuba had a biological weapons capacity and that it was exporting it to other nations the intelligence analysts seemed to want to limit the assessment to a declaration that cuba could develop such weapons according to alternet bolton attempted to have the chief bioweapons analyst in the state departments bureau of intelligence and research and the cias national intelligence officer for latin america reassigned under oath at his senate hearings for confirmation as ambassador he denied trying to have the men fired but seven intelligence officials contradicted him ultimately intelligence officials refused to allow bolton to make the harsh criticism of cuba he sought to deliver and were able to keep their positions bolton claims that the issue was procedural rather than related to the content of his speech and that the officers who did not work under him behaved unprofessionally democratic congressman henry waxman alleged that bolton played a role in encouraging the inclusion of statement that british intelligence had determined iraq attempted to procure yellowcake uranium from niger in bushs  state of the union address these statements were claimed by critics of the president to be partly based on documents found to be forged waxmans allegations could not be confirmed as they were based on classified documents bolton stated in june  congressional testimony that iran was lying about enriched uranium contamination another unmistakable indicator of irans intentions is the pattern of repeatedly lying to  the iaea  when evidence of uranium enriched to  percent was found it attributed this to contamination from imported centrifuge parts however later isotope analysis supported iran’s explanation of foreign contamination for most of the observed enriched uranium at their august  meeting the iaeas board of governors concluded based on the information currently available to the agency the results of that analysis tend on balance to support iran’s statement about the foreign origin of most of the observed heu contamination bolton wrote a book titled surrender is not an option in it bolton criticizes the bush administration for changing its foreign policy objectives during the start of the administrations second term critics allege that bolton tried to spin intelligence to support his views and political objectives on a number of occasions greg thielmann of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research inr was assigned as the daily intelligence liaison to bolton thielmann stated to seymour hersh that bolton seemed troubled because inr was not telling him what he wanted to hear  i was intercepted at the door of his office and told the under secretary doesnt need you to attend this meeting anymore according to former coworkers bolton withheld information that ran counter to his goals from secretary of state colin powell on multiple occasions and from powells successor condoleezza rice on at least one occasion in  a former politician from swedens liberal party who a quarter of a century earlier had been the party chairman but since had left the stage of active politics nominated bolton for the nobel peace prize technically almost anyone can file such a nomination and there was no indication that the nobel committee had pondered the name of bolton the prize that year went to muhammad yunus and grameen bank for advancing economic and social opportunities for the poor especially women through their pioneering microcredit work on may   at the hay festival of literature  arts in hayonwye wales the british activist george monbiot attempted to make a citizens arrest of bolton for his role as an architect of the iraq war the attempt was unsuccessful and monbiot was ejected by security personnel in june  bolton dismissed palestinian claims to statehood as a ploy in july  bolton was identified as a key member of groundswell a secretive coalition of right wing activists and journalists attempting to make political change behind the scenes through lobbying of highlevel contacts permanent representative to the united nationsedit president george w bush announces the nomination of bolton as the us ambassador to un as secretary of state condoleezza rice looks on on march   bolton was nominated to the post of us ambassador to the united nations by president george w bush as a result of a democratic filibuster he was recessappointed to the post on august   boltons nomination received strong support from republicans but faced heavy opposition from democrats due initially to concerns about his strongly expressed views on the united nations holding a – majority in the senate foreign relations committee tasked with vetting ambassadorial nominees the republican leadership hoped to send boltons nomination to the full senate with a positive recommendation concern among some republicans on the committee however prompted the leadership to avoid losing such a motion and instead to send the nomination forward with no recommendation in the full senate republican support for the nomination remained uncertain with the most vocal republican critic ohio senator george v voinovich circulating a letter urging his republican colleagues to oppose the nomination democrats insisted that a vote on the nomination was premature given the resistance of the white house to share classified documents related to boltons alleged actions the republican leadership moved on two occasions to end debate but because a supermajority of  votes is needed to end debate the leadership was unable to muster the required votes with only a – majority in the body an earlier agreement between moderates in both parties to prevent filibustering of nominees was interpreted by the democrats to relate only to judicial nominees not ambassadorships although the leader of the effort sen john mccain said the spirit of the agreement was to include all nominees on november   bush only days after losing both houses to a democratic majority sent the nomination for bolton to continue as representative for the united states at the un he said i believe that the leaders of both political parties must try to work through our differences and i believe we will be able to work through differences i reassured the house and senate leaders that i intend to work with the new congress in a bipartisan way to address issues confronting this country views on the united nationsedit ambassador bolton briefing on the human rights commission and un management reform at the new york foreign press center bolton has been a strong critic of the united nations for much of his career in a  global structures convocation hosted by the world federalist association now citizens for global solutions he stated  there is no united nations there is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world and thats the united states when it suits our interests and when we can get others to go along he also stated that the secretariat building in new york has  stories if you lost ten stories today it wouldnt make a bit of difference both boltons opponents and his supporters have used the same video of his remarks at the  event in support of their points of view when pressed on the statement during the confirmation process he responded theres not a bureaucracy in the world that couldnt be made leaner in a paper on us participation in the un bolton stated the united nations can be a useful instrument in the conduct of american foreign policy bolton was also one of the signers of the january   pnac letter sent to president bill clinton urging him to remove saddam hussein from power using us diplomatic political and military power the november   washington times article can the us find a substitute for the un noted that bolton advocates a revolution of reform at the un specifically he called for the five permanent members of the un security council to work more closely to craft powerful resolutions and make sure they are enforced and to address the underlying causes of conflicts rather than turning them over to the secretariat and special envoys a focus on administrative skills in choosing the next secretarygeneral and a more credible and responsible human rights commission bolton noted that the us had the option of relying on regional or other international organizations to advance its goals if the un proves inadequate  nomination senate confirmation hearingsedit day edit on april   the senate foreign relations committee reviewed boltons qualifications bolton said that he and his colleagues view the un as an important component of our diplomacy and will work to solve its problems and enhance its strengths echoing secretary of state condoleezza rice words from a month earlier republican committee chairman richard lugar of indiana criticized bolton for ignoring the policy consequences of his statements saying diplomatic speech should never be undertaken simply to score international debating points to appeal to segments of the us public opinion or to validate a personal point of view the committees top democrat joe biden of delaware compared sending bolton to the un to sending a bull into a china shop and expressed grave concern about boltons diplomatic temperament and his record in my judgment your judgment about how to deal with the emerging threats have not been particularly useful biden said republican senator george allen of virginia said that bolton had the experience knowledge background and the right principles to come into the united nations at this time calling him the absolute perfect person for the job russ feingold a democrat on the committee from wisconsin asked bolton about what he would have done had the rwandan genocide occurred while he was ambassador to the united nations and criticized his answer – which focused on logistics – as amazingly passive according to newsday lincoln chafee a republican from rhode island may be pivotal for boltons nomination his initial remarks were cautiously favorable you said all the right things in your opening statement chafee stated that he would probably support bolton unless something surprising shows up according to an associated press story on the hearing three protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings standing up in succession with pink tshirts and banners one reading diplomat for hire no bully please these protesters were part of a group advocating representation in the senate for residents of the district of columbia that is known for such demonstrations at a variety of hearings day edit on april   the senate panel focused on allegations discussed above that bolton pressured intelligence analysts calling bolton a serial abuser  former state department intelligence chief carl w ford jr said ive never seen anybody quite like secretary bolton  i dont have a second third or fourth in terms of the way that he abuses his power and authority with little people ford contradicted boltons earlier testimony saying i had been asked for the first time to fire an intelligence analyst for what he had said and done ford also characterized bolton as a kissup kickdown sort of guy implying that he was always ready to please whoever had authority over him while having very little regard for people working under him lugar who criticized bolton at his april  hearing said that the paramount issue was supporting bushs nominee he conceded that bluntness may be required even though it is not very good diplomacy chafee the key member for boltons approval said that the bar is very high for rejecting the presidents nominees suggesting that bolton would make it to the senate erosion of republican supportedit wikinews has related news us senator voinovich allows bolton nomination to pass to full senate vote on april  democrats with support from voinovich forced lugar to delay the committee vote on boltons nomination until may the debate concerning his nomination raged in the senate prior to the memorial day recess two other republicans on the foreign relations committee chafee and chuck hagel also expressed serious concerns about the bolton nomination asked on april  if he was now less inclined to support the nomination chafee said that would be accurate he further elaborated that boltons prospects were hard to predict but said he expected that the administration is really going to put some pressure on senator voinovich then it comes to the rest of us that have had some reservations on april  it emerged that melody townsel a former usaid contractor had reported to the senate foreign relations committee that bolton had used inflammatory language and thrown objects in the course of her work activities in moscow townsels encounter with bolton occurred when she served as a whistleblower against a poorly performing minority contractor for usaid ibtci townsel told the senate foreign relations committee staff that bolton had made derogatory remarks about her sexual orientation and weight among other workplace improprieties in an official interview with senate foreign relation committee staff townsel detailed her accusations against bolton which were confirmed by canadian designer uno ramat who had served as an ibtci employee and one of townsels aid colleagues time magazine among other publications verified townsels accusations and ramats supporting testimony and townsels story was transcribed and entered into the official senate committee record townsel who was an employee of young  rubicam at the time of her encounter with bolton continued working for the company on a variety of other usaid projects on april  the new york times and other media alleged that boltons former boss colin powell was personally opposed to the nomination and had been in personal contact with chafee and hagel the same day reuters reported that a spokesman for senator lisa murkowski ralaska said that the senator felt the committee did the right thing delaying the vote on bolton in light of the recent information presented to the committee on april  the guardian reported that powell was conducting a campaign against bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together which among other things had resulted in powell cutting bolton out of talks with iran and libya after complaints about boltons involvement from the british it added that the foreign relations committee has discovered that bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to  intercepts by the national security agency staff members on the committee believe that bolton was probably spying on powell his senior advisers and other officials reporting to him on diplomatic initiatives that bolton opposed however rich lowry pointed out that during the same fouryear period other state department officials made roughly  similar requests also on may  newsweek reported allegations that the american position at the th review conference in may  of the nuclear proliferation treaty had been undercut by boltons absence without leave during the nomination fight quoting anonymous sources close to the negotiations the democrats filibusteredit on may   senate democrats postponed the vote on boltons un nomination the republican leadership failed to gain enough support to pass a cloture motion on the floor debate over bolton and minority leader harry reid conceded the move signaled the first filibuster of the year the democrats claimed that key documents regarding bolton and his career at the department of state were being withheld by the bush administration scott mcclellan white house press secretary responded by saying just  hours after all the good will and bipartisanship over a deal on judicial nominees its disappointing to see the democratic leadership resort back to such a partisan approach the failure of the senate to end debate on boltons nomination provided one surprise for some senate majority leader bill frist rtn voted against cloture for procedural reasons so that he could bring up a cloture vote in the future although voinovich once spoke against confirming bolton he voted for cloture senator john thune rsd voted to end debate but announced that he would vote against bolton in the upordown vote as a protest against the governments plans to close a military base ellsworth in his home state on june   the senate voted again on cloture the vote failed – six votes short of ending debate that marked an increase of two no votes including the defection of voinovich who switched his previous yes vote and urged president bush to pick another nominee democrats mark pryor mary landrieu and ben nelson voted to end debate both times on june  frist expressed his view that attempting another vote would be pointless but later that day following a lunch at the white house changed his position saying that he would continue to push for an upordown votecitation needed voinovich later recanted his opposition and stated that if bolton were renominated he would have supported the nomination accusations of false statementedit on july   it was revealed that a statement made by bolton on forms submitted to the senate was false bolton indicated that in the prior five years he had not been questioned in any investigation but in fact he had been interviewed by the state departments inspector general as part of an investigation into the sources of prewar claims of weapons of mass destruction in iraq after insisting for weeks that bolton had testified truthfully on the form the state department reversed itself stating that bolton had simply forgotten about the investigation recess appointmentedit wikinews has related news bush likely to appoint bolton during congressional recess bush appoints john bolton united states ambassador to the united nations on august   bush officially made a recess appointment of bolton installing him as permanent us representative to the un a recess appointment lasts until the next session of congress ends or until the individual is renominated and confirmed by the senate during the announcement bush said this post is too important to leave vacant any longer especially during a war and a vital debate about un reform democrats criticized the appointment and senator christopher dodd dct of the senate foreign relations committee said bolton would lack credibility in the un because he lacked senate confirmation un secretarygeneral kofi annan welcomed mr bolton but told reporters that the new ambassador should consult with others as the administration continued to press for changes at the united nations term at the unedit the economist called bolton the most controversial ambassador ever sent by america to the united nations some colleagues in the un appreciated the goals bolton was trying to achieve but not his abrasive style the new york times in its editorial the shame of the united nations praised boltons stance on reforming the disgraceful united nations human rights commission saying john bolton is right secretarygeneral kofi annan is wrong the times also said that the commission at that time was composed of some of the worlds most abusive regimes who used their membership as cover to continue their abusiveness bolton also opposed the proposed replacement for the human rights commission the un human rights council as not going far enough for reform saying we want a butterfly we dont intend to put lipstick on a caterpillar and call it a success  nominationedit bush announced his intention to renominate bolton for confirmation as un ambassador at the beginning of  and a new confirmation hearing was held on july   in the hope of completing the process before the expiration of boltons recess appointment at the end of the th congress voinovich who had previously stood in opposition to bolton had amended his views and determined that bolton was doing a good job as un ambassador in february  he said i spend a lot of time with john on the phone i think he is really working very constructively to move forward over the summer and during the fall election campaign no action was taken on the nomination because chafee who was in a difficult reelection campaign blocked a senate foreign relations committee votecitation needed without his concurrence the sfrc would have been deadlocked – and the nomination could not have gone to the senate floor for a full vote bush formally resubmitted the nomination on november   immediately following a midterm election that would give control of the th congress to the democratic party chafee who had just lost his reelection bid issued a statement saying he would vote against recommending bolton for a senate vote citing what he considered to be a mandate from the recent election results on tuesday the american people sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with the foreign policy approach of the bush administration to confirm mr bolton to the position of un ambassador would fly in the face of the clear consensus of the country that a new direction is called for on december   bolton announced that he would terminate his work as us representative to the un at the end of the recess appointment and would not continue to seek confirmation his letter of resignation from the bush administration was accepted on december   effective when his recess appointment ended december  at the formal adjournment of the th congress the announcement was characterized as boltons resignation by the associated press united press international abc news and other news sources as well as a white house press release and president bush himself the white house however later objected to the use of this language deputy press secretary dana perino told cbs news it is not a resignation the actual language of the presidents written acceptance was it is with deep regret that i accept john bolton’s decision to end his service in the administration as permanent representative of the united states to the united nations when his commission expires however at press conference the president said i received the resignation of ambassador john bolton i accept it im not happy about it i think he deserved to be confirmed some news organizations subsequently altered their language to phrases such as to step down to leave or to exit support for boltonedit during his confirmation hearings in  letters with signatures of more than  coworkers and professional colleagues were sent to senator richard lugar chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in praise of bolton and contradicting other criticisms and allegations concerning his diplomatic style and his treatment of colleagues and staff in late  when his nomination was again before the committee another letter signed by more than  professional colleagues supporting the renomination was sent to senator lugar a wall street journal op ed by claudia rosett on december   said in part bolton has been valiant in his efforts to clean up un corruption and malfeasance and follow un procedure in dealing with such threats as a nuclear north korea a hezbollah bid to take over lebanon and the nuclearization of hezbollahs terrormasters in iran but it has been like watching one man trying to move a tsunami of mud american enterprise instituteedit john bolton in  after leaving the george w bush administration bolton returned to the american enterprise institute for public policy research as a senior fellow with research areas in foreign policy and international organizations in boltons time at the american enterprise institute a conservative think tank he spoke against the policy of rewarding north korea for ending its nuclear weapons program he said the policy would encourage others to violate nuclear nonproliferation rules so that they could then be rewarded for following the rules theyd already agreed to on three episodes of fox news in may and june  bolton suggested that israel might attack iran after us elections in novembercitation needed in january  bolton proposed a threestate solution to the arab israeli conflict in which gaza is returned to egyptian control and the west bank in some configuration reverts to jordanian sovereignty on july   john bolton was appointed to the board of directors for ems technologies inc elmg a georgiabased tech company that subcontracts for many dod contractorscitation needed he is a frequent guest on the fox news channel criticism of the obama administrationedit john bolton spoke on foreign policy challenges for the obama administration at chatham house in  bolton likened the president to æthelred the unready the turn of the first millennium anglosaxon king whose reputation for indecisiveness and his unsuccessful effort to buy off viking raiders made him historys paradigmatic weak leader in an interview with the los angeles times bolton contended that obamas efforts on international issues are nothing more than dithering in september  when the obama administration declared the death of al qaeda target and americanborn radical anwar alawlaki in yemen bolton commented i think its important as individual al qaeda figures and other terrorists are killed that we not read more into it than there is consider this analogy if you were around in the s and somebody said my god vladimir lenin is dead the bolsheviks will never recover from this so while alawlakis death is significant i would not read cosmic consequences into it john bolton caused a controversy on december   when he claimed on greta van susterens show on fox news that secretary of state hillary clinton faked a concussion to avoid testifying before congress regarding the attack on the us consulate in benghazi libya on september   that killed four americans including the sitting ambassador bolton stated when you don’t want to go to a meeting or conference or an event you have a diplomatic illness and this is a diplomatic illness to beat the band in  he wrote a foreword for the book the postamerican presidency the obama administration’s war on america while maintaining close relations with its authors farright conservative bloggers activists and commentators pamela geller and robert spencer bolton endorsed their book writing this book carries forward the ongoing and increasingly widespread critique of barack obama as our first postamerican president what it recounts is disturbing and its broader implications are more disturbing still peoples mujahedin of iranedit bolton has spoken in favor of the peoples mujahedin of iran also known as the mujahedine khalq or mek an armed islamic group with marxist leanings which has long been on the us state department list of foreign terrorist organizations according to the state department the mek follows a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam in the s mek members who had been trained by the soviet union in guerilla warfare and supported khomeini  assassinated us military officers then working in iran mek members actively took part in the  seizure of the us embassy in tehran according to a us government report according to conservative activist kenneth timmerman executive director of the foundation for democracy in iran iranianamericans openly refer to mek leader massoud rajavi as the pol pot of iran because they believe he would conduct wholesale massacres of his political opponents on january   bolton drew a standing ovation at a mek conference in brussels for his support of the mek giving a speech in which he backed mek’s legitimacy and the notion of removing it from the list of terrorist organizations georgetown law professor david d cole has pointed out that the united states government has labeled the mujahedeen khalq a foreign terrorist organization making it a crime to provide it directly or indirectly with any material support including engaging in public advocacy to challenge a group’s terrorist designation under the supreme courts  decision in holder v humanitarian law project however the mek were later removed from the terrorist list in both europe in  and the usa in  presidential considerationedit edit john bolton speaking at the  conservative political action conference cpac in national harbor maryland on february   bolton considered running for president in the  us presidential election he had received attention in conservative circles including the cover of the december   issue of national review magazine he told politico as i survey the situation i think the republican field is wide open i dont think the partys anywhere close to a decision and stranger things have happened for example inexperienced senators from illinois have gotten presidential nominations in an interview with national review bolton said individual liberty is the whole purpose of political life and i thought it was threatened back then and i write i give speeches i appear on televisionbut the only way in contemporary american circumstances to make those issues as salient as they should be is to run for president in an interview with the daily caller bolton said im obviously not a politician ive never run for any federal elective office at all and you know it is something that would obviously require a great deal of effort on tuesday september   bolton announced on the fox news show on the record with greta van susteren that he would not run for president of the united states in  republican presidentialhopeful newt gingrich said that he would ask bolton to serve as his secretary of state on january   bolton endorsed mitt romney for the  republican nomination edit bolton considered running in the  us presidential election in an interview with national review robert costa wrote the following quoting bolton he wants to be president of the united states or at the very least a provocative contender for the republican nomination in  my hypothesis is that voters are practical and they care more about national security than the media seems to believe i think right now especially after two terms of president obama they want a president who has the knowhow to lead during a crisis a president who can defend our national interests he says after expressing interest in running for president bolton ultimately ruled himself out on may   in a video message posted from twitter on wednesday september   freedom capital investment management appointed bolton as a senior advisor to oversee the firm on international security financial and political risks possible trump administration positionedit in an interview with conservative radio host hugh hewitt during the  us presidential campaign republican nominee donald trump named bolton as a possible choice for secretary of state appearing on fox news fox and friends on december   bolton admitted he was being considered as a secretary of state candidate for the incoming trump administration several trump associates claim bolton was not chosen in part due to trumps disdain for boltons signature mustache the evening of december  the bbc cited nbc reports that sources close to mr trump were  saying that mr tillerson is likely to be named next week and that former un ambassador john bolton will serve as his deputy bolton has supported theories about the health of hillary clinton and about hillary clinton aide huma abedin and in december  bolton stated that the conclusion of the united states intelligence community that russian hackers intervened to help elect donald trump in  may have been a “false flag” operation however bolton changed his stance later in the month to support the conclusion that the russian government was involved in hacking the us presidential election in a subsequent interview on fox news bolton criticized the obama administrations retaliatory sanctions as insufficient and suggest that the us response should make them the russians feel pain president trump interviewed bolton and three others to determine who to fill the position of national security advisor vacated by lt gen michael t flynn the position ultimately went to h r mcmaster trump made a point on monday of praising mr bolton and saying that he would find a position for him in his administration eventually referencesedit  jennifer senior january   bolton in a

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in

loading i havent given up on the possibility that sweet reason will prevail john bolton sweet up reason theres no such thing as the united nations if the un secretary building in new york lost  stories it wouldnt make a bit of difference john bolton lost building new york we estimate that once iraq acquires fissile material  whether from a foreign source or by securing the materials to build an indigenous fissile material capability  it could fabricate a nuclear weapon within one year john bolton build within year diplomacy is not an end in itself if it does not advance us interests john bolton end diplomacy itself its not natural disasters that are to blame for the deprivation of the north korean people but the failed policies of kim jong il john bolton people blame natural in the united states there is a broadly shared view that the un is one of many potential instruments to advance us issues and we have to decide whether a particular issue is best done through the un or best done through some other mechanism john bolton best potential view the un is one of many competitors in a marketplace of global problem solving john bolton problem competitors global everybody pursues their national interests the only one who gets blamed for it is the united states john bolton only national united there is no such thing as the united nations john bolton united nations united a lot of people have said to me thats a great idea running for president youll get booked for more speeches you can write a book john bolton great book people you dont need to spend tens of millions of dollars on political consultants to tell you what you think when you already know what you think john bolton political know think negotiation is not a policy its a technique its something you use when its to your advantage and something that you dont use when its not to your advantage john bolton negotiation you something i think that especially among conservatives theres a clear understanding that there are three legs to the conservative stool there are the freemarket economics conservatives the social conservatives and the nationalsecurity conservatives john bolton economics understanding when you have a regime that would be happier in the afterlife than in this life this is not a regime that is subject to classic theories of deterrence john bolton life you classic you know as somebody who writes opeds and appears on the television i appreciate as well as anybody that there is a limit to what that accomplishes john bolton appreciate know limit north korea is going to get away with keeping its nuclear weapons john bolton away going weapons theres no religious test under the constitution thats what it says period john bolton constitution test period people say you favor assassination what do you think war is except that its assassination on a much larger scale a much more horrific scale john bolton war people think i think the international criminal court could be a threat to american security interests because the prosecutor of the court has enormous discretion in going after war crimes and the way the statute of rome is written responsibility for war crimes can be taken all the way up the chain of command john bolton war responsibility politicians like generals have a tendency to fight the last war john bolton war fight generals just as the security council was largely irrelevant to the great struggle of the last half of the twentieth century  freedom against communism  so too it is largely on the sidelines in our contemporary struggles against international terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction john bolton freedom great struggle my philosophy is not a beancounting accounting look at this it is a philosophy that smaller government is better government and government that is closer to the people is best of all john bolton best philosophy government there is no patriotic obligation to help advance the career of a politician who is otherwise pursuing interests that are fundamentally antithetical to your values thats not the call of patriotism john bolton patriotism help values its very personal in its politics very bitter and very negative john bolton politics negative bitter im a conservative republican i have been since i was  years old and participated in the goldwater for president campaign in
