editor and we may publish it in print autonation inc will start selling selfbranded service contracts in  texas stores this month in a move that begins the retailers nationwide launch of privatelabel finance and insurance products autonation plans to brand all protection products sold in its dealerships under the autonation name by year end it plans to begin selling those products online in  after an online pilot to be conducted this year privatelabel products are another way to add substance to the retailers branding initiative ceo mike jackson said that initiative began in early  with most of the companys dealerships assuming the autonation name in place of regional brand names by extending the brand autonation to mean something you have to take it to more than just a name on the store jackson said every time i sell an autonation product that delights a customer like a service contract that further binds the customer to us in another new way rather than handing them off to a warranty company before this months move autonation the countrys largest newvehicle retailer sold  extended service plans across the company autonation executives say the company took the best elements from all  to create one plan that offers what it bills as bestinclass coverage the autonation plan is provided and administered by the warranty group a service contract provider in chicagoother products through the rest of this year autonation plans to add privatelabel options for its other fi products provided by the same vendors the company works with today said steve strader autonations senior vice president of customer financial services those include vehicle appearance protection sold via permaplate and tire and wheel coverage sold via safeguard products international the new approach is possible because customers now know the autonation name strader said thirdparty surveys show that consumers have a higher awareness of the autonation brand than of the brands the company used to use he said in the past we were not comfortable in trying to launch what we call a privatelabel product because we did not have the brand recognition strader said now we do the privatelabel products will be sold at all domesticbrand and massmarket importbrand stores carrying the autonation name the initiative excludes the companys luxurybrand stores that havent adopted the autonation brand name strader said autonation isnt shutting out products offered by the automakers but those plans will be sold only when customers request them for instance if a customer at an autonation ford store wants to buy a fordbranded extended service contract autonation will sell it but were going to attempt to sell our own plan first strader saidretailer as administrator while the products will be provided by thirdparty vendors for now the company eventually may consider doing so itself that would be more profitable but it would require autonation to develop the scale and experience to administer such programs and the resulting customer claims strader said he said autonation will stick with the thirdparty approach for at least three years i would venture to say down the road that a lot of these products and services that we use third parties to administer and provide over a longterm horizon will all gradually migrate to within our company strader said but thats a decision we havent made yet you can reach amy wilson at awilsonautonewscom tags finance  insurance mike jackson autonation send us a letter have an opinion about this story click here to submit a
