contains our financial statements the following discussion may contain forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made the matters discussed in these forwardlooking statements are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made projected or implied in the forwardlooking statements we believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable however our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations financial position and cash flows in the future business overview atlas america series  b lp we us or the partnership is a delaware limited partnership and formed on january   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or the mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  on february   the mgps ultimate parent atlas energy lp atlas energy which was a publicly traded masterlimited partnership was acquired by targa resources corp and distributed to atlas energys unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner atlas energy group llc atlas energy group otcqx atls atlas energy group became a separate publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the mgp as a result of the distribution following the distribution atlas energy group continues to manage arps operations and activities through its ownership of the arps general partner interest the partnership has drilled and currently operates wells located in pennsylvania tennessee and west virginia the partnership has no employees and relies on the mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy group february   and prior atlas energy for administrative services the partnerships operating cash flows are generated from its wells which produce natural gas and oil produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems the partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold the partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be required for drilling the economic viability of the partnerships production is based on a variety of factors including proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and through currently installed extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving drilling completing or reworking a well there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in projecting future net revenues the prices at which the partnerships natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the partnership is not guaranteed a specific natural gas price for the sale of its natural gas production changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the partnerships cash flow and the value of its reserves lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the partnerships revenues but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the partnership can produce economically historically there has been no need to borrow funds from the mgp to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners however the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted as we originally intended accordingly the mgp determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the mgp intends as necessary to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months the mgp has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which primarily produce natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as  well tending routine maintenance and adjustment  reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and  preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of december   our mgp withheld  of net production revenue for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry natural gas the mgp markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to thirdparty plant operators who process and market the gas the sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index the production area and pricing indices for the appalachian basin are dominion south point tennessee gas pipeline and transco leidy line columbia appalachia nymex and transco zone  we do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes as is customary in certain of our other operating areas we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement crude oil crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company the crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region less appropriate trucking charges we do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements natural gas liquids ngls are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining dry gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline the resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our ngls are generally priced using the mont belvieu tx or conway ks regional processing indices the cost to process and fractionate the ngls from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility we do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of ngls in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements for the year ended december   chevron natural gas and atmos energy marketing llc accounted for approximately  and  respectively of our total natural gas oil and ngl production revenues with no other single customer accounting for more than  of revenues for this period general trends and outlook we expect our business to be affected by the following key trends our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of  and throughout  the causes of these declines are based on a number of factors including but not limited to a significant increase in natural gas oil and ngl production while we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the longterm in the areas in which we operate fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas oil and ngl reserves our future gas and oil reserves production cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently we face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas oil and ngl prices as initial reservoir pressures are depleted natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases results of operations gas and oil production the following table sets forth information related to our production revenues volumes sales prices production costs and depletion during

pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges  average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period previously recognized derivative gains were  for the year ended december   natural gas revenues our natural gas revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges which were driven by market conditions and a  decrease in production volumes our production volumes decreased to  mcf per day for the year ended december   from  mcf per day for the year ended december   a decrease of   mcf per day the price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements see item businesscontractual revenue arrangements thus the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions the decrease in production volumes is mostly due to the normal decline inherent in the life of the wells in addition to wells shutin due to it being uneconomical to continue production in the current pricing environment oil revenues we drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas rather than oil but some wells have limited oil production our oil revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in oil revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in oil prices and a  decrease in production volumes our production volumes decreased to  bbls per day for the year ended december   from  bbls per day for the year ended december   a decrease of  bbl per day  natural gas liquids revenue the majority of our wells produce dry gas which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser some wells however produce wet gas which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons ie natural gas liquids that must be removed prior to transporting the gas once removed these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers our natural gas liquids revenues were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in liquid revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year was attributable to a  decrease in production volumes and a  decrease in liquid prices our production volumes were  and

commodity derivative instruments as of december   which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners capital on our balance sheet will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle we recognized a gain on marktomarket derivatives of  for the year ended december   this gain was due primarily to marktomarket gains in the current year primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year there were no gains or losses on marktomarket derivatives during the year ended december   costs and expenses production expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   this decrease was a result of lower transportation expenses due to lower natural gas sales prices and production volumes as wells were shutin due to being uneconomical in the current pricing environment depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively this change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively a decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us impairment of gas and oil properties during the years ended december   and  were  and  respectively at least annually we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value to the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value an impairment charge is recognized as a result of this assessment an impairment charge was recognized during the years ended december   and  this charge is based on reserve quantities future market prices and our carrying value we cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods liquidity and capital resources we are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to fund our obligations and make distributions to our partners the natural gas oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of  and throughout  the extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to impact our outlook we have experienced downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the significant declines in commodity prices our mgp continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general and administrative costs including renegotiating contracts with contractors suppliers and service providers reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs our mgp will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in managing our cost structure and in turn our liquidity to meet our operating needs to the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further or we experience other disruptions in the industry our ability to fund our operations and make distributions may be further impacted and could result in the mgps decision to liquidate our operations historically there has been no need to borrow funds from the mgp to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners however the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted as we originally intended accordingly the mgp determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the mgp intends as necessary to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months the mgp has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern if however the mgp were to decide to liquidate our operations the liquidation valuation of the partnerships assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert it is possible that based on such determination we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited partners a liquidation could result in the transfer of the postliquidation assets and liabilities of the partnership to the mgp and would occur without any further contributions from or distributions to the limited partners there was no cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities were  the year ended december   this decrease was due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion net noncash gain loss on derivative value impairment and accretion of  a decrease in the change in asset

compared to the year ended december   there was no cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   the cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   were  resulting from the sale of tangible equipment there was no cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   this decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs through december   our mgp has withheld  of funds for this purpose any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties impairment during the years ended december   and  we recognized impairment expense of  and  respectively related to gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at december   and  the estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by among other factors the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices environmental regulation our operations are subject to federal state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety see item  environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last  years and we anticipate that such changes will continue trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on operations such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants generation and disposal of wastes including wastes that may have technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials and use storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health the environment andor threatened or endangered species other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the united states it is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change or that our efforts will prevent material costs if any from rising changes in prices and inflation our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and

atlas resource partners lp arp arp  on february   the mgps ultimate parent atlas energy lp atlas energy which was a publicly traded masterlimited partnership was acquired by targa resources corp and distributed to atlas energys unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner atlas energy group llc atlas energy group nyse atls atlas energy group became a separate publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the mgp as a result of the distribution following the distribution atlas energy group continues to manage arps operations and activities through its ownership of the arps general partner interest we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee and west virginia we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy group february   and prior atlas energy for administrative services we intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as � well tending routine maintenance and adjustment � reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and � preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells have been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of june   our mgp has withheld  of net production revenues for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and the first six months of  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry results of
