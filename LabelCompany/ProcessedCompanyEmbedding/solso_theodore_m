the main story share this page continue reading the main story detroit — after general motors emerged from bankruptcy and a government bailout five years ago the board of directors of the “new gm” was expected to keep a more watchful eye on a company that had gone seriously off trackbut on the issue of vehicle safety the board until recently took a mostly handsoff approach rarely even discussing the topic beyond periodic reviews of product quality with company executives according to interviews with current and former board members as well as gm officials with knowledge of the board’s actionsin february the initial recall of hundreds of thousands of cars with defective ignition switches was treated in such a routine manner at the board’s monthly meeting that the board’s chairman theodore m solso said he had only a vague recollection of the details“i can’t remember the specifics” mr solso said in an interview “it was a large recall there were probably cost estimates” advertisement continue reading the main story since february gm has been rocked by additional recalls totaling nearly  million vehicles as well as by disclosures that some company officials had known about the defective switches for more than a decade at least  deaths have been linked to the defect the automaker is the subject of multiple investigations and has set aside nearly  billion to cover its costs although mr solso said the directors were never as passive as others suggest he acknowledged that since the first recall they have met more frequently and have received regular updates about safety issues continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “it was a period of time that we learned how serious the situation was” he said adding “when we had all the facts we did our job”the events of the last few months have delivered a jolt to a board that has experienced high turnover and the sudden retirement in january of its leader daniel f akerson who had held both the chairman and chief executive jobs for four years the board is now confronting the fact that it was blindsided by years of corporate misconduct that has set off the most serious safety crisis in the company’s historythe directors are coming under harsh criticism several lawsuits have been filed by gm shareholders against current and former board members for failing to exercise their fiduciary duty to oversee management in addition the company faces wideranging investigations of its actions by the justice department the securities and exchange commission and  state attorneys generalone shareholder lawsuit filed on behalf of a st louis police pension fund and an individual stockholder claims board members are “guilty of a sustained and systemic failure” to keep informed of safety and recall issues “they set up a system that is calculated not to inform them about safety issues” said david honigman a lawyer for plaintiffs in the casesenator richard blumenthal one of gms sharpest critics during congressional hearings said the board had abdicated to gm management too much responsibility for resolving the switch crisis “the board’s silence and apparent absence as a force is really regrettable” said mr blumenthal democrat of connecticutgm officials dispute the notion that the board has been absent noting that it has hired outside lawyers to investigate the company approved a compensation fund for accident victims and formed a new committee to monitor potential risks within gms vast engineering and manufacturing operations“we didn’t understand the enormity of the situation at the beginning because i don’t think management did” said mr solso who became chairman in january after serving on the board since june  and who is the retired head of the cummins engine company “it was an evolving problem” advertisement continue reading the main story interviews with current and former executives and directors reveal that the first weeks after the february meeting were tumultuous for the board one former official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the directors became “very nervous” as gm followed the initial recall with a flurry of others photo theodore m solso gm’s chairman said its board was slow to learn of a safety issue credit lauren victoria burkeassociated press there were also concerns among board members that senior management primarily mary t barra the chief executive and michael p millikin the company’s general counsel had been given too much latitude to chart the company’s response to the ignition switch problems according to one director who was not authorized to speak publicly said another gm official also not authorized to speak on the matter “it was a little bit of mary and a whole lot of millikin”it was mr millikin the officials said who pushed for gm to retain a former federal prosecutor anton r valukas to investigate the longdelayed recall — an inquiry that found no wrongdoing by either mr millikin or ms barra who is also a board member and the board relied on ms barra and other executives to select the  employees that gm dismissed for their involvement in the delay as well as to initiate major changes in safety and engineering functionsmr solso who has spoken only rarely in public since february said during a minute interview by telephone from his home in indiana that the gm board was now “very much involved and engaged” he was the only board member made available by gm to the new york times newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a

events surrounding the switch crisis “i really can’t talk because of the issues” said ms telles a psychologist who served on the board for four years before stepping down in june “there are all these shareholder lawsuits”mr solso was circumspect about the board’s performance before the recall — particularly after mr valukas’s report in june uncovered years of errors missteps and deception among engineers lawyers and product specialists charged with finding out why a deadly defect could cut engine power and disable air bags in millions of oldermodel chevrolet cobalts saturn ions and other compact cars“yes we should have known earlier” mr solso said “the way i look at it gm has not been well run for a long period of time”mr solso said he was “shocked” and “stunned” at the findings in the page report by mr valukas which detailed how dozens of gm employees failed repeatedly to repair the switch defect despite mounting evidence that the problem put drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injurybut mr solso contended that the board and management were not lax about safety “the problem with the ignition switch recall is that people did not do their job” he said “they didn’t have a sense of urgency and they didn’t communicate up the ladder” advertisement continue reading the main story documents turned over to federal regulators and congress show that the board did not devote much time to safety in recent years with the exception of one meeting in which crashtest issues with the chevrolet volt hybridelectric vehicle were discussed safety issues were typically folded into occasional reports from management on product quality according to the valukas report the last time that happened was in october  but the discussion was mostly about how gm vehicles fared in consumer polling nothing about the switch came before the board until its meeting in februaryby then it was a board in transition mr solso had been a surprise choice to succeed mr akerson as chairman having beaten out another director patricia f russo who was lead outside director during mr akerson’s tenuremr solso acknowledged that the board whose members are paid  annually had relied heavily for direction on ms barra and mr millikin as well as mark reuss gms global product chief and he conceded that some directors were “frustrated” by the volume of recalls that followed the ignition switch action and that they questioned whether enough employees were fired after the valukas report but he said all major decisions had been reached by consensus between directors and management since that february meeting still the board hired its own law firm wachtel lipton rosen  katz in april to help evaluate management a senior partner in the firm martin lipton has attended every board meeting since thenmr solso had particular praise for mr millikin a veteran gm lawyer who was attacked during congressional hearings for his failure to know about switchrelated lawsuits against the company he called mr millikin a “really important person” at gm and a valued adviser to both the board and ms barra “we’re plowing through some new ground” mr solso said “and he’s been one of the strongest and most honest voices we have”the board is also seeking some stability within its own ranks besides mr akerson’s retirement three of its  directors left in june one new director the union official joe ashton was elected at the company’s annual meeting that same monthsome members are stepping up their involvement by serving on the new riskmanagement committee including james j mulva a former head of the oil company conocophillips adm michael g mullen a retired former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and thomas m schoewe a former chief financial officer at walmart stores“the ignition switch recall basically raised the bar in terms of increased involvement” mr solso said continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what
