seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»cone midstream this smallcap mlp has great growth potentialmar  about cone midstream cnnx breaking the cycle dividend investing reits macro oil  gassummarythe us is in the middle of a shale revolution and the marcellus shale formation is at the heart of that revolutioncheap natural gas is steadily replacing coal as our source of power generationdrilling costs operating costs and lease operating expenses are some of the lowest in the nation at the marcellus as rigs return this field will be a hot spotcone midstream partners is an mlp that has outstanding fundamentals and is located in the middle of the marcelluswith safe and growing distribution coverage low debtebitda future growth potential and a healthy and growing dividend above  this stock is worth considerationthe face of energy in the us has transformed in the last two decades coal is losing its dominance as the primary power source across the nation three catalysts are responsible for this shift away from coal in favor of natural gas coal fired power plants are aging and wholly inefficient theres increasing political pressure to reduce carbon emissions and the emergence of abundant affordable natural gas the shale revolution made possible by advancements in hydraulic fracturing is the main catalyst responsible for the rapid transition taking place there are a variety of shale fields in play across the nation but when it comes to natural gas the marcellus shale is king over  billion cubic feet of natural gas is produced per day in this particular shale this is more than double the gas production of the permian basin which is the secondlargest natural gas producing formation in fact the marcellus outproduces the bakken shale eagle ford shale haynesville shale and utica shale combined the marcellus natural gas trend will be integral as the energy landscape of the us  and the world  evolves over the coming decades with ever increasing natural gas production comes demand for the infrastructure to transport the product and ultimately bring it to market cone midstream partners lp nysecnnx is a master limited partnership that offers exposure precisely in this space they have  miles of gathering pipeline in the heart of the marcellus play it appears that cnnx is poised for long term growth as the marcellus continues to feed a natural gas hungry nation the current administration is proving thus far to be supportive of future pipeline projects as well this along with healthy levels of capital investment should be a boon to our natural gas pipeline network formed by sponsors consol energy nysecnx and noble energy nysenbl cnnx services their well head production which has grown by  since  see table  below what makes this all the more impressive is the fact they managed to grow production despite a reduction in well completions in  and  reduction in well completions was not limited to cones sponsors but instead was a nationwide phenomenon due to the drop in oil and natural gas prices from november  to februarymarch  natural gas prices are largely influenced by domestic supply and demand if the us experiences a warm winter like the two warm winters in  and  then demand drops and prices are negatively effected the culprit of these two warm winters was driven by an event called el nino scientists have stated that el nino has finally subsided and cooler winters should return this should increase demand and drive the price back up to more sustainable levels for producers although prices have not yet fully recovered they have shown considerable improvement in the last few quarters and all indicators point toward further recovery another key driver to support future natural gas demand is the ever increasing exportation of natural gas and gas feedstock abroad the us recently became a net exporter in natural gas companies like enterprise products partners lp nyseepd and cheniere energy nysemktlng are leading the way in natural gas exports demand for us natural gas will continue to rise as both domestic demand begins to increase post el nino and exports to mexico and overseas continues to rapidly increase table  cnx and nbl well head production vs completed wells by year source company q as with all revolutions the transformation that is taking place in the us is not without setbacks the last two years are proof of that but the future of natural gas is a bright one cnx and nbl already have  more wells drilled and ready to be completed in q  than all of last year combined since  cnx and nbl have drilled and completed a combined  wells and have a potential  drilling locations on their current acreage the potential benefit to cnnx in production scale could be enormous although the sponsors have taken their lumps the worst appears to be behind them cnnx appears to be perfectly positioned to gain from their ever increasing production growth and improving well completion rate according to a study in q  by the us energy information administration well completion costs and lease operating costs in the marcellus basin are some of the most favorable in america improving well head designs and cost rates will continually drive overall expenses downward and efficiency upward this all bodes very well for cone midstream lp which has already put up impressive numbers even in the face of the  commodity price drop their business model is less focused on commodity price and more to do with production volumes the greater the volumes that pass through cnnxs pipelines the better they do table  above plainly shows that production volume is on an upward trajectory and table  below shows that the stock was also on an equally impressive upward trajectory last year table  cnnx vs sp  vs alerian mlp index one year cnnx has been on quite the run in the previous year rising over  vs the sp  and alerian mlp index at  and  respectively all the while cnnx has been paying out a handsome dividend currently yielding above  they have also increased their payout every year since going public in  last years dividend increase was  distribution coverage and profit margin cnnx has a very low current debt load they reduced their current liabilities by  in  and further reduced current liabilities in  by another  their overall debtequity is  cnnx has compounded its distributable cashflow annually by  and ebitda by  since  their net income has grown at an even faster clip of  this has given cnnx healthy distribution coverage of x which is up from last years solid x coverage cnnx currently operates at over  profit margin and over  return on investment capital debt i just touched on the great debtequity but the debtebitda is equally impressive at a low  anything under  is preferable and a debtebitda under  makes cnnx the envy of most mlps pdcf and analysts estimates instead of using the pe ratio to determine if an mlp is underovervalued most analysts use the pdcf ratio its difficult to nail down what the industry average is but consensus points toward a x pdcf ratio as being the industry average for an mlp cnnx has a pdcf ratio of x it appears cnnx is within the realm of fair value cnnx has an average rating as a buy eight analysts rated cnnx a strong buy and four rated cnnx a hold the average price target according to analysts is  with a high target of  according to analysts the stock has an average upside of  it is worth noting that cnnx outperformed earnings estimates in three out of four quarters in  and was on target in the remaining quarter insider buying there has been a little insider buying going on but nothing to really get too excited about just last month an officer purchased more than  shares this adds support to the overall idea that cnnx is heading in a good direction recommendation although cnnx appears to be within the realm of fair value it would be wise to err on the side of caution when initiating a position the stock ran up considerably in the previous year and with good reason in order to have real investing success its wise to give yourself a margin of safety the stock enters the low end of fair value at  and enters undervalued territory at  giving the current volatility with the fed we might see cnnx approach these levels soon all mlps and reits have been fairly volatile in recent days due to looming interest rate hikes entering into a small position between  and  on further weakness should be considered it should be emphasized that this stock does come with certain inherent risks it is a smallcap stock and with all smallcap positions volatility should be expected being so intimately linked to cnx and nbl is also a risk to consider additional warm winters could hamper future drilling and potential production levels mlps fuel growth with both debt and unit offerings and this could potentially dilute shareholder value if the capital raised is not allocated efficiently that said the growth potential is incredibly compelling see table  next  years per annum  past  years per annum  table  previous five years growth and analysts predictions source yahoo finance conclusion cone midstream lp has a short but impressive track record of explosive growth great margins and low debt the dividend is solid growing nicely and well covered sponsors consol energy and noble energy have rapidly increased well head production every year since  well completion is set to be on the rise once again and they have over  potential drilling locations on their dedicated acreage these three intimately interconnected companies lie in the heart of the largest natural gas play in the us the marcellus shale rigs are returning and capital investment is gaining momentum nationwide the marcellus is one of the most costeffective places to drill for natural gas natural gas is fast replacing coal as our source of power generation the us is exporting natural gas at a pace never before imagined and our current administration is bullish on energy and energy infrastructure cnnx is in an important position in the most important natural gas field in the nation and is poised for longterm growth it should be on
