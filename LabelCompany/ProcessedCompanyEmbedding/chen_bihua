one of the most wellknown and popular days on the calendar we all know the day as april fool’s day but it has been called all fools’ day as well it is this day that everyone questions what they are told and constantly checked behind in front and even to their sides for tricksters because let’s face it getting someone in an april fools’ joke is fun and thrilling except for the victim of course some pranks can be harmless and fun for example taking oreo cookies and scrapping the icing out just to replace it with toothpaste before serving to your friend now that is hilarious and what makes it better is the face you have to witness as they take that bite expecting a sugary sweet filling only to be met with a minty fresh toothpaste this fun filled trickery laden day has been popular since the th century but even though it’s a widely celebrated day no country has claimed this day as an actual holiday if you have ever read the canterbury tales written by geoffrey chaucer back in  you would see that was the first recorded association between the day april  and foolishness it’s crazy to think this day filled with jokes and trickery can be followed so far back in history here’s yet another fun fact for your arsenal of fun facts…april fools’ day was celebrated as a roman festival known as hilaria…can you spot the similarity hilaria…hilarious…jokes…pranks…get it depending on your location in the world you might celebrate this day differently take a look at the uk for example they celebrate the day only until midday if the prankster is playing a joke after midday in the uk they actually become the april fool themselves and you could say the joke is on them so if you are in the uk best get up early and start your pranking so you can be finished by midday most of the places who take part in the debauchery that is april fool’s pranks use the phrase “april fool” to show their victim has been pranked on this day ireland’s traditional april fool’s day consists of a person entrusted to deliver an “important letter” to someone once the letter is delivered and the recipient reads it they find out they should “send the fool further” this would lead to another letter being sent to someone else and would continue until the victim realized what was going on or was informed of the prank the media are even taking part in this prank day by publishing at least one article on this day that is fake they will reveal the prank either in tiny print at the bottom of the article or wait to reveal the truth the next day it’s hard to get away from pranks on april fool’s day unless you stay in your home keeping your doors locked and phone turned off but why fight it get out and have fun with it some cultures makes a game of it to see who can create the best prank life’s too short to be serious all the time so get out there on april st and have some fun   httpbihuachencomwpcontentuploadsddaefbbdflargexaprilfoolsdayjpg   bihua chen httpbihuachencomwpcontentuploadslogopng

for spring can be a wonderful weekly activity from planting until they bloom as well as being a pleasant way to welcome the spring without spending a fortune this activity is not only loved by the ones who are garden lovers but it takes a heck lot of interest for those too who plant seeds and wait for them to emerge out in addition the children love this activity the most  “there is a series of simple activities that can be used to prepare your garden for spring” says bihua chen a gardening devotee measures to prep your garden for spring deep cleaning of the garden is very essential though it is a delicate task in which it is necessary first to free the plants from the dry leaves and the damaged parts that hinder the natural growth to make them look beautiful the hedges and shrubs also need pruning in which old broken or damaged wood and wilted flowers should be removed as for the grass the main care is required make sure to leave the grass very short so that it grows stronger and homogeneously also it is very important to fertilize the lawn so that it has the necessary nutrients and irrigate it with greater intensity so that it stays healthy however apart from this the following are the things that need to be taken care of these points are mentioned by bihua chen follow these steps and prepare your garden for spring and that too for sure plant seeds it is best to plant the seeds as soon as the spring arrives use the seeds of past season be it of flowers and vegetables that grew in the garden make sure that the seeds are dry as soon as the spring draws near plant the seeds in seedbeds and keep them under the sunlight however you can also buy good quality seeds from the market plant the cuttings ask for the cuttings from a friend or a neighbor plant these cutting too botanic gardens almost and always prune on roses and other plants in the middle of winter or early spring wait until the frost season is over once the probability of frost is zero take the seedlings out and continue to water them do it for one or two weeks so that they can adapt from the internal to the external environment make sure you water the plants in time also take care of the plants that are weak so that they sustain when you are done with all this it means this is the time when your garden is in reality prepared with all the blooming colors of flowers with the vegetables

by bihua chenmarch a month that emphasizes meteorologically speaking is very variable the third month of the year stands out for leaving the winter behind and starting the spring in addition we will also have to change the time so we can take advantage of more hours of light during the afternoon so are you looking forward to what happens in march follow us and we tell you in detail everything you should know about the month of march unpredictable weather in march march is usually a very changing month with very rainy and cold days and other sunny and spring days as for temperatures the average maximums exceed  degrees in most of the regions world meteorological day since  the world meteorological day commemorates the entry into force on march   of the convention establishing the world meteorological organization every march  is used to warn about the effects of pollution on the climate march a windy month the month of march is one of the windiest especially in the northern half early spring bihua chen mentions that on march  the spring will officially begin so it is the best time for planting seeds also he mentioned that it will last until the  of june which is the beginning of the summer this means that the spring is on the move daylight saving time changes on march  at  in the morning the clock will be changed at  in the morning this way we will have more hours of light in the afternoons whereas in the morning it will dawn later the time change occurs twice a year and its goal is to save energy in addition one fact is that on the first day of spring sunrise and sunset occur  hours apart march a month of tomatoes strawberries chard sole or suckling pig being a transition month between winter and spring we have seasonal fruits and vegetables like chard tomatoes strawberries artichokes or green beans the fish and shellfish are at their best are the scampi and sole while meat suckling pig or rabbit are highly desirable first flowers that arrive in march indeed the month of march refers to colorful flowers and honey bees roaming over them but there are certain flowers like daffodils lilies tulips irises and lilacs that appear in spring primarily depicts bihua chen a garden enthusiastic spring fever are you going through it if yes then this means that the spring fever is not just an expression the experts say that our body feels changes due to the difference in temperature hormones and diet the growth of boys you may probably not know about this fact that the boys grow more in spring than at other times of the year this happens because during the spring children tend to spend more time outdoors doing physical activity and exposed to more sunlight which helps to accelerate the growth process baby animals are born surprising yet a truth that many animals give birth like cows birds and ducks this is because animals need to have their offspring when the weather allows them access to more food and warmer temperatures

consideration to generating current income the funds seek to meet this objective by investing substantially but not solely in the publiclytraded common stock of companies in the healthcare industry north tide performs indepth analysis to determine a fair intrinsic value for various stocks within the healthcare universe and as market prices fluctuate around thatintrinsic value they look for opportunities to profitnorth tide employs a rigorous investment process that relies on primary research and detailed financial modeling to develop and test differentiated contrarian views that focus on a longerterm investment horizon the firm believes that this approach provide the funds opportunities to capitalize on both the inherent investment opportunities in the healthcare sector as well as opportunistically profit from shortterm market dislocationsnorth tide invests in healthcare companies with marketcap greater than  billion which they believe are subject to significant market and knowledge inefficiencies and are generally relatively liquid investment opportunities they also invest in companies with marketcap less than  billion north tide believes companies with lower marketcaps though less liquid generally have fewer analysts and investors following them which often results in greater market and knowledge inefficiencies allowing for a more favorable riskreturn than larger companiesas part of their strategy and to maximize returns the funds may employ leverage as deemed prudent by north tide the funds generally employ leverage in an amount equal to approximately  of their assets however they may employ greater amounts of leverage in the sole discretion of north tide or if opportunities or market conditions present favorable opportunities if north tide is unable to identify favorable investments with an asymmetric riskreward they may significantly reduce the use of leverage or employ no leverage at all north tide may also employ an investment strategy with a fairly concentrated portfolio provided any single position doesnt represent more than  of a fund’s exposure at any time with the exception of etfs synthetic “basket” short positions or other hedging instruments which may exceed such amount portfolio manager    millennium management llc millennium management is a global investment management firm with more than
