entity the reduction of mercury and nitrogen oxide nox emissions at select coalfired power generators through the burning of refined coal rc produced by rc facilities placed in service by tinuum group we benefit from tinuum groups production and sale of rc which lowers emissions and generates tax credits as well as the revenue from selling or leasing rc facilities to tax equity investors see the separately filed financial statements of tinuum group and the other related rc entities within our  form k results of operations generally this improved performance during the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   can be attributed to a combination of factors including across the board reductions in all categories of expenses driven by restructuring activities in april and july  and by a reduction in resources to complete the reaudit and restatement of prior financial statements the restatement with such activities related to the restatement being substantially completed by april  the following sections provide additional information regarding these comparative periods for comparability purposes the following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements included in item  of this quarterly report the periodtoperiod comparison of financial results may not be

shown separately below consulting services and consulting services cost of revenue we also provide consulting services related to emissions regulations during the three months ended march   and  revenues decreased quarter over quarter due to a decrease in the number of consulting service engagements performed the decrease in the number of consulting services engagements was in part due to us no longer performing consulting services related to certain equipment systems previously installed due to diminishing market demand we do not believe this revenue component will be material in the near term additional information related to revenue concentrations and contributions by class and reportable segment can be found within the segment discussion below and in note  to the condensed consolidated financial statements other operating expenses three months ended march  change in thousands except percentages     operating expenses payroll and benefits          rent and occupancy

tinuum group     earnings from tinuum services   loss from rcm    earnings from equity method investments     earnings from equity method investments and changes related thereto are impacted by our equity method investees tinuum group tinuum services and rcm through the date of the sale of our interest in rcm on march   earnings from equity method investments increased during the three months ended march   compared to the same quarter in  due to an increase in cash distributions in excess of our investment balance from tinuum group during the three months ended march   we recognized  million in equity income from tinuum group compared to our proportionate share of tinuum groups net income of  million for the period during the three months ended march   we recognized  million in equity earnings from tinuum group compared to our proportionate share of tinuum groups net income of  million for the period the difference between our prorata share of tinuum groups net income and our earnings from our tinuum group equity method investment as reported on the condensed consolidated statements of operations is the result of previously received distributions from tinuum group being in excess of the carrying value of the investment and therefore we recognize such excess distributions as equity method earnings in the period the distributions occur as discussed in more detail below the carrying value of our investment in tinuum group was zero as of march   as cumulative cash distributions received from tinuum group exceeded our prorata share of cumulative earnings in tinuum group the carrying value of our investment in tinuum group will remain zero as long as the cumulative amount of distributions received from tinuum group continues to exceed our cumulative prorata share of tinuum groups net income for quarterly periods during which the ending balance of our investment in tinuum group is zero we only recognize equity earnings from tinuum group to the extent that cash distributions are received from tinuum group during the period for quarterly periods during which the ending balance of our investment is greater than zero eg when the cumulative earnings in tinuum group exceeds cumulative cash distributions received we recognize our prorata share of tinuum groups earnings losses for the period less any amount necessary to recover the cumulative earnings shortfall balance as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter see additional information related to our investment balance equity earnings losses and cash distributions in note  of the condensed consolidated financial statements as of march   and  tinuum group had  and  invested rc facilities respectively that were generating rental income tinuum group did not have any retained rc facilities that were generating operating income or losses or internal revenue code section  tax credits ptcs and other tax benefits as of march   and  equity earnings from our interest in tinuum services decreased by  million during the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   tinuum services provided operating and maintenance services to  and  operating rc facilities respectively tinuum services derives earnings both from fixedfee arrangements as well as fees that are based on actual rc production depending upon the specific rc facility operating and maintenance agreement during february  we purchased a membership interest in rcm and recognized in all subsequent reporting periods equity method losses resulting from the operation of the rc facility owned by rcm although rcm generated tax credits and tax benefits that are available to us equity losses from our interest in rcm decreased during the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   due to the sale of our  membership interest in rcm on march   for a cash payment of  million and assumption of the outstanding note payable made by us in connection with our purchase of rcm membership interests from tinuum group in february  as a result of the sale we are no longer a member of rcm and are no longer subject to any quarterly capital calls and variable payments to rcm we earned the following tax credits that may be available for future benefit related to the production of rc from the operation of retained rc facilities three months ended march  in thousands   the decrease in tax credits earned during the three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   was due to suspending operations on retained facilities as well as the sale of rcm in march  tax credits earned during the three months ended march   relate to the temporary retained operation of an rc facility prior to its leasesale to a tax equity investor additional
