partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee and ohio we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy lp atlas energy for administrative services our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce natural gas and oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through thirdparty gas gathering systems we do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as well tending routine maintenance and adjustment reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of march   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues volumes sales prices production costs and depletion during the periods indicated

respectively a decrease of   the  decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended march   as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a  decrease in production volumes

three months ended march   from  mcf per day for the three months ended march   a decrease of  mcf per day  the overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended march   as

purchasers our natural gas liquid revenues were  for the three months ended march   costs and expenses production expenses were  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively a decrease of   this decrease was due to lower transportation fees and monthly supervision fees due to wells being temporarily shutin for repairs and maintenance depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively these percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues oil and gas reserve quantities product

decrease of   these expenses include thirdparty costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our mgp the decreases for the three months ended march   is primarily due to a decrease in thirdparty costs as compared to the prior year similar period liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased  in the three months ended march   to  as

months ended march   representing the net of  in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and  for the purchase of tangible equipment cash used in financing activities decreased  during the three months ended march   to  from  for the three months ended march   this decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners our mgp may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs any additional funds if required will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our mgp or its affiliates which are not contractually committed to make loans to us the amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed  of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from thirdparties the partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows

 b lp if so the white law group may be able to help you recover your losses according to their website atlas resources partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors  the company often raises money for investments through reg d private placement offerings like the company did for atlas resources public  b lp these reg d private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission usually between  as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from  atlas resources partners lp filed for bankruptcy protection on july  and joins dozens of struggling oil and gas producers that were pushed into chapter  after energy prices began dropping in  since the beginning of  at least  north american oil and gas producers have defaulted according to haynes  boone llp those cases involve about  billion in cumulative debt the law firm said in a june  report the trouble with alternative investment products like atlas resources public  b lp is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds  an additional risk inherent to atlas resource partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities the white law group continues to investigate the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like atlas resources public  b lp broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age risk tolerance net worth financial needs and investment experience however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commission and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresentation the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a finra
