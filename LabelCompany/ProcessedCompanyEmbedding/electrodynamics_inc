specials tech talk email us   edr powr backr double your safety double your fun no hassles the edr powr backr uses two v battery packs and two heavyduty doublepole switches to provide dualredundant security to your airborne system just like in fullsize aircraft with the edr powr backr you can tolerate a single failure opencircuit shortcircuit low voltage in either battery pack or switch or battery wiring without losing radio control the edr powr backr continually monitors both battery packs and switches for the one with the higher voltage and routes that to your rx and servos you may combine different size packs in practice with two good packs the edr draws power equally from both packs adding their individual capacities ie if battery  is a vmah pack and battery  is a vmah pack you will have an mah power supply onboard with at least mah to fly on in case of a failure   tech note our edr powr backr is still the only redundant battery system currently on the market that offers true ground isolation between the two batteries  this means that you can safely use any multioutput charger or two dc field chargers connected to the same v field box battery to charge your two redundant batteries thru the switch harnesses hasslefree  without this feature exclusive to the edr your chargers may become confused by the common ground between the batteries and the batteries may end up being improperly charged  we all know what that means without our edr  the only safe way to charge those two batteries is to unplug one of them from the switch harness  or use two separate singleoutput ac chargers  what a hassle faqs how much current can the edr handle the edr is capable of handling up to  amps continuous dc and  amps pulse ms on  ms off  thats more than rc system wiring and connectors can handle  rc connectors are rated to handle a max of  amps doesnt the single output of the edr limit its maximum current most rc receivers have only one battery port so the standard edr has one output cable  this does limit the total current that the rc system receiverservos can handle  if is possible in most receivers to supply power thru more than one port eg thru the battery port plus an unused servo channel since battery power in the receiver is internally routed paralleled to all servo outputs to take advantage of this by popular request we now offer a dualoutput option our edrt in all our packages which allows the powr backr to supply a full  amps to the receiverservos just select dualoutput edrt in the ordering options below packages powr backr

graduated from the university of singapore in  with a bachelors in electronic engineering after that i worked for  years as an electronics and control systems designer in industrial automation in  i went back to school and graduated from the university of michigan with a masters in aerospace engineering after that i worked in the automotive industry in electronic engine controls in  i decided to venture out on my own and combine my love of engineering and my love of aviation i started electrodynamics inc armed only with my dreams and some personal savings   next my hobby life can you still call it a hobby if you work at it for a living i started aero modeling for real in  in high school with my first cox pt ucontrol trainer why for real every one whos got aviation in their blood must have had a childhood punctuated with plastic airplane kits and the odd chuck glider and rubberpowered ship i later progressed in cl ucontrol was also called control line culminating in competition in cl racing stunt and combat  and still actively flying cl saw me saving a whole years lunch money for my first single channel proportional rc set it was a hinode singlechannel unit with rudimentary analog encoding rather than todays digital encoding in  i got my first digital proportional channel futaba radio at that time sold as mrc havent looked back since im now active in all aspects of the
