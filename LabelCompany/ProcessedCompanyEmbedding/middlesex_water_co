from the main connection located near the street to the foundation of your home over time environmental conditions and aging can break down sections of pipe causing deterioration and cracks as the homeowner it’s likely your responsibility for repairing any damage to the water service line that’s on your property what is an exterior water service line water mains are the pipes delivering the water supply throughout most towns this network of pipes is usually installed below the town’s streets a water service line is what connects your home with the water main   most homeowners have a water service line that stems from the water main beneath the street from there it extends below the front yard and runs into your home at the point of the foundation once your water service line reaches the inside of your house it’s referred to as a “water distribution pipe” usually your water service line is ¾” to ″ in diameter and rests at a depth determined by the building code in your community gaining access to the buried water service line makes repairs and replacement of the pipe difficult the job often involves heavy machinery such as a backhoe and industrial grade pipe cutters and the cost of the machinery plus the materials for the repairs can be over       homeserve national repair average  and us census bureau data  common symptoms of a water service line problem it is easy to ignore a problem that is literally buried underground even when aged water and sewer mains in cities and towns are replaced the lines that connect a private home to the public mains will continue to age representing an increased risk to the homeowner some symptoms are more visible than others these are some indicators that your home might have a potential water service line failure

pressuredirtsand coming out of fixtures causes of damage to a water service line according to the american society of civil engineers water mains are aging rapidly and pose one of the most serious challenges to our nation’s infrastructure water infrastructure continues to deteriorate and it will take tremendous time and investment to revitalize the amount of infrastructure that requires fixing today with this in mind homeowners should understand the consequences of failing water and sewer infrastructure has on them and their community and what they can do to stay safe secure and avoid financial surprises in the meantime common causes of an exterior water service line failure aging of pipes corrosion expansion and contraction due to temperature changes freezing due to extreme cold tree roots ground settling rocky soil pushing or settling on a pipe pressure solutions for repairing a water service line the number of burst pipes in the front yard of american homeowners will likely climb higher as existing pipes age  and often it is those who are least able to afford it who will struggle to pay the price  service repair plan providers give homeowners a way to protect themselves homeowners and their families need to know that water infrastructure is a crucial part of their daily lives and a significant threat to their individual safety and finances  the increasing risks of burst water and waste pipes on a homeowner’s property are very real and can be managed while our country focuses our infrastructure for the future with a repair plan from homeserve you can get

of the water service line to minimize disturbance to surface obstacles concrete landscaping structuresreplace the entire water service line by digging an open trench homeowner responsibility one of the most common misconceptions regarding water infrastructure is that the utility provider or the government will take care of the problem if there is a leak on private property unfortunately while local utilities and municipalities foot the bill for repairs to much of our declining infrastructure on citystate property the homeowner is primarily responsible for the service line that brings fresh water to their home as well as the sewerseptic line on their property the majority of basic homeowners insurance policies also do not cover repair or replacement of the water service lines on your property and most home inspectors are not required to check the condition of your exterior water systems when you purchase your home does your homeowners insurance cover exterior water or sewer line breaks buying or building a home is one of the biggest investments a family will make and homeowners insure their homes to protect from unanticipated home emergencies  however many homeowners don’t know where their insurance plan ends and their liabilities begin they are often surprised to find out they are typically responsible for repairs to the pipes and wires in and around their home see the chart below to find out if your basic insurance policy covers water or sewerseptic line breaks water service line quick facts  an exterior water service line is the pipe that originates from the water main beneath the street and travels into your foundation providing the water supply for your home typically older water service lines are made of cast iron or galvanized steel while most water service lines installed after  are pvc or copper while only two inches in diameter water service lines deliver water to your home at high pressure often  psi or more the depth at which your water service line is buried on your property is commonly determined by local building codes or ordinances usually your water line is set below the average frost line to ensure it doesn’t freeze during the winter settling of the ground around the water service line calcification mineralization due to hard water rust seasonal changes kinking and pitting are just a few examples of the types of damage that cause water service lines to fail it is estimated that  homeowners will suffer a water service line emergency in  most basic homeowners insurance do not cover repairs to the water or sewerseptic service

show more  show less americas infrastructure   an abstract national issue or a real threat to homeowners america’s infrastructure – roads bridges and water and wastewater systems – are an integral part of what made our nation great as recently as  america’s infrastructure ranked in the top ten for overall quality today we are ranked th below many of our biggest trading partners and even some developing nations how did our infrastructure – the backbone of a modern economy and lifestyle – become so fragile infrastructure is complicated and expensive but the truth is that america has not been vigilant about the shared burden of infrastructure upkeep our bridges and water mains are getting older and instead of investing to keep them updated we collectively hope the structures serving us will keep working the decay of america’s critical infrastructure isn’t new but there is a crucial untold story that american families need to hear today infrastructure can be a big abstract concept despite the fact that we use it every day but failing water and wastewater systems including the piping that connects these municipal systems to the home can quickly become a very real threat to individual homeowners homeserve aims to bring a focus to the impact that deteriorating water and wastewater systems are having today on municipalities around the country and also the hidden danger facing individual american families with the infrastructure serving their homes the bottom line is that american homeowners should take steps today to prepare themselves and protect their families
