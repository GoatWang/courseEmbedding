march  7 in the passionate playgoer at the elgin theatre toronto ont book by craig lucas based on the original novel “madame sousatzka” by bernice rubens music by david shire lyrics by david maltby jr additional vocal arrangements and music by lebo m directed by adrian noble choreography by graciela daniele set by anthony ward costumes by paul tazewell lighting by howell binkley sound by martin levan projection design by jon driscoll cast ryan allen jordan barrow victoria clark rebecca eichenberger sara jean ford fuschia john hillner judy kaye virginia preston christianne tisdale nicky wyman the production is overproduced overwritten with too many storylines many of which should be cut and too many extraneous songs that should also be cut however the singing of victoria clark as sousatzka judy kaye as the countess and montego glover as the mother is glorious the story sousatzka is based on the  novel madame sousatzka by bernice rubens and not on the  film starring shirley maclaine the novel is set in london it’s about madame sousatzka an eccentric polish piano teacher and her gifted student marcus the son of a single mother from eastern europe but in the musical sousatzka this simple story has been fiddled with to such an extent that it’s just chocking with storylines many of which are not developed or are eyepoppingly incredible playwright craig lucas has made several changes and additions for the musical sousatzka i guess copyright rules prevented the producers from using the clearer title of madame sousatzka sousatzka doesn’t really tell ticket buyers much about the show the setting is still london but it begins in south africa in 7 during the uprisings against apartheid a man named jabulani khenketha leads a group of black south africans seeking justice but are shot at by the police several people are killed and jabulani is sent to prison for treason his wife xholiswa khenketha and their young son themba leave south africa and make a dangerous journey to london  and a better life themba is now the gifted student of madame sousatzka over the course of the show we see madame sousatzka’s back story—family wiped out by the nazis in warsaw poland  and there are other horrors she experiences as well there are the back stories of the rest of the people who live in the boarding house with madame sousatzka themba is torn between his cultural attachment to south africa and the transplanted south africans in london and his awakening to another kind of life involving madame sousatzka and her odd friends themba becomes attached to sarah a white blondehaired blueeyed ballerina in his school which does not go down too well with his mother themba is also conflicted with who he is as a person and the music he wants to follow and of course as themba becomes accomplished madame sousatzka worries that he will leave her on his way to success lots too digest the production in the musical world you set the tone mood and idea of a musical in the first five minutes of the show in the first five minutes of sousatzka we are in soweto south africa 7 this is projected on the back wall of the stage at a rally against apartheid led by jabulani themba’s father several traditional south african songs are sung by a throng in full voice including the south african national anthem and an antiapartheid song i wish there was a projected translation of the songs so we could get the full benefit of their meaning police shoot people are dead and there is a court case with three very angry prosecutors screaming their verdict as jabulani is put in prison there is the escape of themba and his mother to london where most of the musical takes place except for those scenes that go off to other places this musical does not know what it wants to be it’s so confused it doesn’t know if it wants to be a rousing south africa story—though that gets the audience ‘up’ and excited–or an otherwise ‘quiet’ ordinary story in london with some lovely ballads  i found anthony ward’s set oddly designed and often oppressive too often there is a backdrop that goes up a bit higher than the actors on stage that establishes where we are—sousatzka’s flat xholiswa’s london flat etc but above that is darkness it’s as if the actors are playing the scene in a cave the south africa scenes have the benefit of an impressive rising sun etc thanks to the projections by jon driscoll but for the most part there is a sense of gloom because of the odd design by antony ward strange because he’s a fine designer while craig lucas’s book is choking with too many storylines he has captured the deep devotion that sousatzka has to music lucas has also captured her quirkiness in telling themba how to feel the music and let it play in themba we get a sense of the depth of his character for all the problems with this show there are some bright spots victoria clark as madame sousatzka is a gift of an actress she captures the eccentric oddness of sousatzka her confidence her fire and in her quiet moments her uncertainty and she sings like a dream clark is a true clear rich soprano who knows how to interpret the heart and soul of a song she sings the beautiful song “music is in you” to convey that love of music to themba clark is ably matched by judy kaye as the countess a woman with a heart of gold and a keeper of many secrets kaye also sings beautifully one of the best moments is their duet on “let go” a beautiful song about coming to terms with knowing when to let a person in your life go on to other things both are glorious singers and lovely actors jordan barrow as themba has passion and charm you get the sense of his growing confidence and confliction of where he should be in the world he has poise and ability to handle this tricky part montego glover as his mother xholiswa also sings beautifully and is a fine actress she conveys the pride and stubbornness in wanting the best for her son and she does a rousing rendition of “song of the child” that is thrilling until you realise that the song is oddly placed as if it was dropped in the story like an errant piece of lint it’s an important song and should be better placed but too often one wondered what was up with all those songs the music is by david shire the lyrics by richard maltby jr additional music is by lebo m who has written the rousing south africa portion all have done better work elsewhere there are  songs in the first act and 7 in the second with about  songs taking place in south africa many of them should be cut because they are sung by people we don’t know or in situations that can’t support them it’s as if the creators are determined to beat us into submission with too many story lines and too many songs adrian noble’s direction is pedestrian at best he shows us the individual people in sousatzka’s house involved in their activities a man manipulates a client he’s an osteopath a young woman manipulates a client she’s a prostitute what’s missing is who they actually are for context songs are often sung full out to the audience or speeches addressed to them but not the people the speech is meant for so old fashioned graciela daniele’s choreography for the south african scenes is lively and acrobatic when there are scenes in xholiswa’s flat that is cause for more rousing singing—there are usually at least  people there—daniele has them gyrating to a seductive beat so many people associated with this jumble of a show have done good work elsewhere you want to ask “what happened here are you too close to see you need a scissors to cut out swaths of this clutter” themba might have a “brand new family” but that song comes from no where about people we know nothing about cut it themba has enough on his plate to contend with besides also having to deal with a blonde blueeyed girlfriend ballet dancer since nothing of that relationship is developed it’s just plopped in and it’s cheesy cut it cut the ridiculous number “all i wanna do is go dancin” because it veers away from the central plot when themba goes to a soiree at the home of the man who will arrange a concert for him that is not cause for a production number of “manders salon” of the snotty bigoted people invited there the song is clever for no reason and the message of it has been handled better elsewhere in the show cut it while judy kaye sings “ring one bell” beautifully about a christmas in warsaw the song comes from no where and is supported by nothing and veers away from the plot sorry cut it and while the incredulous ending might make one think this is a happy ending it’s just another eyerolling moment in a show full of them comment craig lucas’s book of sousatzka seems like a checklist of the ills of the th century—apartheid the holocaust rape racism bigotry and interracial relations to name a few—and it makes the whole enterprise seem disingenuous it’s as if the creators were taking a basically simple story and puffing it up to look important and substantial and it’s neither sousatzka marks the return of garth drabinsky to theatre producing after an absence of  years some of which was spent in jail because of fraud his intention is to send this to broadway in the fall if garth drabinsky thinks this new production is broadway material he’s  years out of date this production has been kicking around on drabinsky’s bucket list for years and in that time it doesn’t seem that he’s noticed that broadway has changed these overblown bloated productions have passed their ‘bestbydate” song after song is bellowed out giving a false sense of ‘tingle’ and a distinct sense of being manipulated there are  roles in sousatzka with a stuffed cast of  and many of them should be cut in true drabinsky fashion all the creative people on this show are either american or british all the speaking roles are american of the cast of  only  are canadian and they are relegated to the chorus i have seen many of those canadians in the chorus in lead roles in shows across the country but you won’t find that in a garth drabinsky show the message is clear canadians aren’t good enough for a creative or speaking role in a drabinsky show sousatzka was work shopped in toronto where the dollar is weak and has its only run here before it hopes to go to broadway in the fall i would like to think this is one case that drabinsky will not tell us canadians torontonians how lucky we are that this show started here feh teatro proscenium limited parnership and sousatzka broadway limited partnership present
