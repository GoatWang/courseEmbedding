graph databases –computerweeklycom each quarter the editors at searchdatamanagement recognize a data management technology for innovation and market impact the product selected this quarter is reltio cloud  by reltio inc product reltio cloud  release date july   what it does reltio cloud presents a master data management architecture that combines aspects of master data management mdm systems with analytics machine learning and other capabilities the software is hosted on the amazon web services cloud and includes the reltio commercial graph which applies graph database technology to uncover important relationships between data elements and runs together with a cassandra nosql database to speed operations an available apache spark data processing engine is also used to provide analytics capabilities why it matters today a nearsurfeit of unstructured data is challenging traditional approaches to master data management many examples among present master data management architecture are underpinned by some type of relational database that uses relational data models that in turn can require considerable time to update as well relational systems are not immediately amenable to dealing with unstructured data moreover such systems are not necessarily adept at representing the kinds of complex relationships that may exist when social media is mixed with more traditional data types already hosted within an organization reltios graph database provides a nonrelational underpinning for master data management while a spark engine supports advanced analytics to garner a better view into data trends also because the system is cloudbased it is in a good position to support new applications in which data from the cloud provides the center of gravity meanwhile reltio principals come to their use of the new technologies with considerable experience in data management having serving stints with such data management pioneers siperian and informatica what users say michael allelunas said reltios underlying graph technology represents a cornerstone that allows users to work more effectively with unstructured data allelunas general manager of information management at ims health said he and his team had been working closely with reltio software for about two years ims health offers customer relationship management campaign marketing management kpi and other applications for the life sciences industry allelunas said the life sciences and health industries are dealing with a data explosion of the unstructured kind reltio software he said allows his customers to bring in a wide variety of data assets without reformatting he contrasted reltios flexibility with other master data management systems rigidity we have to deal with social data patient data and more it is difficult to both be nimble and to marry all these kinds of data to onpremises master data management solutions because such systems take a lot of cost and effort to update he said the system offers flexibility for analytics and reporting that helps ensure requests for reports can be produced more readily he added drill down a separately licensed module known as reltio insights connects reltio cloud managed data with an apache sparkbased analytical engine the system tapping into the reltio commercial graph can point users to likely relationships that exist between customers and other entities a suggest mode can trigger a workflow to review and approve data change requests bulk edit and custom actions allow any type of action to be applied to a filtered list of records or values
