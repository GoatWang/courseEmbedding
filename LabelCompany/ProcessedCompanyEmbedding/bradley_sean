thought from the pga merchandise show the pga merchandise show is the one time each year where everyone in the golf industry gathers in orlando to show off all of the new clubs gadgets and gear for the upcoming season were on the ground all week doing the legwork for you – heres a roundup of some items that have caught our eye so far keep checking this page as well be updating it continually throughout the week bradley putter company bradleyputterscom all bradley putters are handcrafted from a tree burl sean zak three months ago bradley converse was black friday shopping at the real mother goose craft shop in portland oregon and became inspired to create a putter fast forward  days and he’s now here in his own booth at the pga show in orlando selling people on his product that product is and will be known as a bradley putter a putter with a highlyfurnished wooden head that comes handdesigned from oregon burl wood the wood comes from a longtime family friend who owns oregon burls converse who last worked as a military engineer takes tiny blocks of the wood glues in metal weight inserts for legitimate putter feel and handconstructs the face and sides all from his garage in grants pass oregon it’s something he doesn’t think could be accomplished by a standard milling machine considering the delicate nature of deformed grain known to burls endless species of wood in southern oregon means endless types of burls and all kinds of options for bradley putter co add in some dye and you’ve got even more customization via roygbiv nine colors to be exact “if i want a red white and blue putter oregon burls can dye it red white and blue all that crazy stuff” converse says the process ends with converse himself buffing the putter head until he feels it is ready to be yanked from your bag and used on the green this level of intimacy in production of a bradley putter will cost buyers anywhere from  on the basic end to  “there’s a spectrum” converse says from order to completion securing a bradley putter takes less than one week pretty efficient for a twomonthold company in that time bradley worked via the scientific method to improve his product every day check out their instagram feed for a timeline from the first iteration to the fourth to the seventh and even more according to converse each was made to improve on singular aspects where past versions failed like weighting distribution durability etc after brainstorming the idea on black friday converse “had two putters by the following wednesday took ‘em to the course the first putter sucked…not gonna lie it was a bad putter” “right now my employee back home he’s making putters and trying to break them right now just so we know the whole spectrum” converse says “i’ve already broken several by hitting them like irons just to know what is happening with it” note how he used the singular form of employee bradley putter co is currently a four person enterprise their next big step is to conform to usga standards “it’s not conforming yet but it will be conforming” converse says detailing exactly what he needs to do when he gets back to his garage in that way bradley putter co is not quite out of the woods yet but it holds plenty of promise “as of an hour ago” he continued “we are the official putter company of the swing thought tour” as mainstream a move as that may seem converse promises bradley putter co will forever be intimate he wants customers to visit grants pass and see their eventual shop they are about to sign a lease he believes word of mouth has been his biggest marketing asset and wants owners to share a story about their putter every time they play a round of golf “you’re never going to see these on amazon that’s not what it’s about” converse says “you buy these for yourself you buy these because you love golf you appreciate craftsmanship you appreciate ‘made in america’ you appreciate small town economies you appreciate stories and experiences that’s why you buy a bradley putter”  sean zak indianapolis putter from toulon design odysseygolfcom the indianapolis from toulon design is the companys first shot at a highmoi mallet mike chwasky the new indianapolis  putter from toulon design is the company’s first attempt at a highmoi mallet and it’s pretty impressive inspired by the technology used in the automotive industry the indianapolis features a multimaterial design that produces an astounding moi that exceeds  providing outstanding stability and forgiveness on offcenter hits of the total overall weight of g the milled aluminum face makes up only about  which helps move the cg away from the face and toward the rear of the clubhead and also contributes to a soft but responsive feel at impact the milled steel sole takes up about  of the total weight ensuring the cg is extremely low while a lightweight carbon composite crown section saves enough discretionary weight to allow for about g to be repositioned in the rear wings of the clubhead “we wanted it to punch way above it’s weight for high moi but not make it so big like many other high moi mallets in order to do that we knew we had to have multimaterial construction and look at it from a totally clean sheet of paper”  sean toulon the carbon composite crown not only saves weight to produce a lower deeper cg and exceptionally high moi but also dampens vibration for enhanced feel while also providing an array of both subtle and more obvious alignment features in fact the unique shape and contrasting aluminum face and carbon composite crown section provide up to ten different alignment aids both parallel and perpendicular to the target line for more accurate aim at address the indianapolis will be available at retail on march   mike chwasky setup eye setupeyecom setup eye makes sure you are never misaligned to the target setupeyecom golfers of all abilities can struggle with alignment even tour pros occasionally lean on caddies to point them the right direction enter the setupeye les and sandra egan a chipper couple from county clare ireland created the new gadget to help golfers line up at their target the inspiration was simple “i invented it because i’m a lousy golfer” les said with a laugh four years after sketching out the concept the small devices are here at the pga show and soon could find their way to your golf bag they work in a twostep process first peer through the scope to lock in your target the flag a tree etc then place the unit on the ground at the center of your stance next comes what sandra describes as the “secret sauce” the device will rotate and shoot a narrow beam of light vertically through the ball to help line up your clubface after a few seconds it spins and fires another laser to align your stance the setupeye checks in at a pricey  but it’s certainly innovative it’s also cheaper than bringing a caddie to line up each shot you take this season they are assembled and shipped from ireland and will available in about eight weeks  jeff ritter hudson sutler cooler bags hudsonsutlercom the can and can cooler bags from hudson sutler coleman mcdowell hudson sutler set out in  with the goal to make a better duffel bag consider it done and then some five years later the company is making its debut at the pga show with a booth chock full of duffels backpacks totes dopp kitts and cooler bags in a wide variety of color combinations theyre all made in the united states and at least  pairs of hands touch each item before it lands on your front step the most eyecatching item the pack and pack cooler bags its got a waterproof liner thats used for life rafts a hardy canvas exterior and a reinforced bottom this thing is not leaking it can be carried to the golf course the beach the lake – anywhere where  beers are wanted while setting up their booth on tuesday the crew at hudson sutler had one of the sample bags filled to the brim with drinks and ice they accidentally left it there overnight with all the ice still in it but when wednesday morning came around the ice hadnt melted and the drinks were still cold  the pack is  and the pack is   coleman mcdowell gogolf gps gogolfgpscom gogolf gps can clip onto your sunglasses or hat jeff ritter this pga show has some creative products for gps yesterday i found a golf glove with a gps bug attached to the flap today it’s on your glasses the product is called gogolf gps and it features a miniscule unit that weights less than one third of an ounce and clips snugly onto your specs – or by substituting a larger clip onto your cap or visor it does look a tad goofy “i had a guy yesterday tell me he thought i was taping videotaping him” john leighton the company’s general sales manager said with a laugh “we had to explain it to him” gogolf users download a free app which has maps on more than  courses and links up to the device via bluetooth unlike every other gps i’ve seen which requires golfers to read yardage info from a phone or rangefinder this one transmits information via audio during the round golfers simply press a small button on the gps and a voice will read you the yardage to the middle of the green volume is adjustable if you’re a player who likes to listen to tunes you can also run pandora while simultaneously using the gps at a volume that won’t distract your playing partners the rechargeable battery is good for nine rounds maybe the coolest thing of all is a price   – that is less than half the cost of a rangefinder and most other gpsrelated gizmos they expect to begin filling orders in march  jeff ritter bushnell excel gps watch bushnellgolfcom the bushnell excel gps watch comes preloaded with information about  courses worldwide preloaded with  courses worldwide

pant now comes in four fits tailored slim straight and athletic coleman mcdowell the highland pant is already one of the best golf pants you can buy – and now it’s designed for even more players bonobos previously offered tailored slim and straight styles and now it’s added an “athletic” cut for golfers who want the clean lines of a tapered leg but need extra room in the seat and thighs  bonobos was started with the aim of creating highquality pants that fit perfectly the bonobos golf line formerly under the maide golf umbrella takes that mantra to the course what makes these pants stand out from the competition the details a curved waistband that’s flattering and comfortable no extra material where it’s not needed and a performance polyester blend that allows for enough stretch

this can speed up a round bubba watsons jetpack was on display on the show floor sean zak it was just six months ago that oakley partnered up with bubba watson to announce “bubba’s jet pack” a new and aptly named means of transportation on the golf course finally the public was able to feast its eyes on the product up close and personal wednesday at the pga show in orlando watson himself was on hand at the event to take pictures with the jet pack named “bwair as well as conduct interviews with the media and hit balls in a simulator fans were able to compete for prizes all day on the simulator to get closer than watson’s approach to  feet the jet pack which took three years of collaboration to create and is produced in new zealand is able to fly up to  feet in the air via a  horsepower engine powering two ducted fans the rear side of the “flying golf cart” boasts likely the most significant part a spot for the golf bag in sheer size the jet pack is a behemoth stretching more than seven feet tall stretching just as wide and weighing about  pounds all of that is to say that it currently is illegal to fly in the united states without a pilot’s license there are only two that have been produced and there’s just one pilot in the world who can take the jet pack for a cruise sorry bubba time for pilot’s school  sean zak zero friction distance pro gps gloves zerofrictioncom the distance pro gps glove allows for yardages to be seen at a glance jeff ritter this year oncourse gps in available in the palm of your hand or more specifically on the back of it meet the distance pro gps glove by zero friction the first navigation system that attaches directly to the back of your golf glove   zero friction has been around for more than a decade and two years ago got into the glove business i couldn’t take their new hightech glove to a course but from what i saw in the convention center using it seems like a breeze just power it up on your way to the first tee and then open the corresponding free app on your phone the gps is compatible with both iphone and android and the devices communicate via bluetooth yardages will display on fullcolor hole maps on your phone screen while distance to the front and back of the green and the flagstick also appear on the flap of your glove the gps is outfitted for more than  courses so odds are good your local muni is online    the gps device weighs less than a half an ounce and after wearing it for a few minutes i forgot it was there a pack of two gloves and the gps hits shelves this week starting at  johnny miller has signed on as a pitchman but i didn’t see him at the show today maybe i could’ve found him with gps  jeff ritter virtual green putting simulator fullswinggolfcom golf simulators have become mainstream and with good reason but for all they offer in hooking you up to pebble beach from your brooklyn basement putting has always been the most difficult aspect to replicate that’s where virtual green comes in virtual green is owned by the popular simulator company fullswing and promises to “replicate any putt in golf” that means – quite literally – any putt even memorable ones from the past the platform simulator uses pinpoint technology located beneath the surface to raise and lower specific sections of the synthetic green to build a new specific putting surface from scratch players can use the accompanying software to select how much break and just how intense the break on their corresponding putt for instance on wednesday at the pga show jordan spieth’s coach cameron mccormick helped event attendees read and try to make the same putt spieth hit on the th green in the final round of the  us open at chambers bay if you need a refresher on that putt see below as we found out wednesday it’s very difficult mccormick was able to adjust the intensity of the lefttoright breaking putt on  intervals  being as close as possible to the original putt spieth made  months ago unlike mainstream simulators that measure only the physics of a putt and project it onto a simulator screen virtual green actually allows you to watch the ball either lip out of the physical cup or drop in for birdie thankfully there’s plenty of room for celebratory fist pumps  sean zak ​iceblock putter iceblockputtercom the ice block putter stands by itself in order for the player to get the best alignment possible before putting sean zak often at the pga show – among the thousands of products that can make the event quite dizzying – products must stand out visually to grab your eye one new product stands out on its own literally it is the iceblock putter the name makes sense as the putter head is oblong and transparent like a block of ice in this scenario however your block of ice holds up a putter shaft on its own its eye catching the novel concept of a “stand alone” putter came to creator daniel f à wengen a swiss surgeon who owns a slew of patents  in all from hearing aids to nose implants as he wanted to improve how players stroke their putts his theory is that too many players strike with an open face at impact so he placed multiple alignment marks atop the putter to help reel in attention to face angle the block holds the shaft upright allowing the player to back away on the green and read their putt with the putter in clear view from that wengen believes he has solved an address issue relative to the specific read of the green “you put it on the putting green you leave it there you take a step back you look through the putter head” wengen says “you adjust the face angle until it is perfectly right where you want the ball to go” then of course you make the putt one glaring fault is that the putter stands on its own mainly on flat green locations but not where there is significant undulation good news though the putter has already been ruled to conform by the ra all that remains is making the stroke which requires little effort the head is nearly  grams the putter is available at iceblockputtercom but will hit you with a driveresque price of   sean zak golf board golfboardcom the golf board brings some youthful energy to our classic game jeff ritter golf we all know has its share of problems when explaining lackluster participation numbers one term often cited is the dreaded fword fun of course is golf too stuffy at times perhaps enter golfboard a company now in its fourth year producing motorized skateboardstyle carts i bumped into the golfboard display at demo day and at first glance operating one seemed tricky “lots of people think it’s tough but it’s a breeze” said jeff dowell golf board’s highenergy president accepting the challenge i hopped on driving the board really was simple you stand in place one foot in front of the other like a skateboard your clubs ride in front at the center of the handlebars lies the throttle just press it down to move forward release it and the engine cuts out for a quick stop turning takes some selftrust lean one direction or the other and the board responds it requires some effort to toss your body weight into the corners but it’s also a blast i never fell off or even felt close to biting it dowell said that when he started producing boards which start at  he expected sporty millennials to drive his business surprisingly many retirees have also gravitated to it “it’s all about lifestyle” dowell said “if you’re athletic you can do it” dowell says boarders rip through  holes  faster than twosomes in a golf cart because you don’t have to track two golf balls and  faster than walkers golfboard has currently outfitted more than  courses around the world including tracks in the us uk spain portugal indonesia and australia and not all courses are flat resorts the boards can handle uneven terrain “they’re even more fun and easier on hills” dowell said “they chew ‘em up and spit ‘em out” sounds like fun doesn’t it  jeff ritter epon af driver epongolfcom the new epon af is the first with a multimaterial clubface mike chwasky the epon af driver  features a traditional pear shaped super deep face aimed at better players with faster clubhead speeds the first epon driver with a multi material clubface both ks and ti titanium the af produces extra forgiveness on offcenter hits without sacrificing ballspeed or distance in addition an extremely thin and light beta titanium crown creates a cg location that’s approximately  lower than that of the previous af for higher launch angles and more carry distance “endo’s epon products are the epitome of what a forging manufacturer is capable of producing without any limitations” says jeff sheets technical director for epon golf usa “the epon products are the cream of the crop” for those not “in the know” epon products are manufactured by endo manufacturing co ltd one of the most respecting forging facilities in the world endo continues to make products for many of the industry’s biggest oem brands but has also been making it’s own products under the epon name since it’s inception as a subsidiary in   mike chwasky the putting stroke teacher tpsteachercom the putting stroke teacher helps you keep your arms working as a single unit in the putting stroke sean steinemann for my money the putting stroke teacher is by far one of the easiest most effective putting aids out there the idea is simple grip your putter like you normally do and then position the yellow rod across your forearms this will create that perfect “v” with your arms and shoulders from there all you have to do is make a stroke the putting stroke teacher takes your hands completely out of the stroke and allows you to feel what a perfect stroke is supposed to be like the best part it takes only five minutes to set up and folds down to a manageable size that conveniently fits in any golf bag so whether it’s before your round a putting practice session or even if you just have  free minutes at home you can turn your very own putter into an aid will help you groove a solid repeatable putting stroke something every golfer can benefit from  sean steinemann cure putter rx series cureputterscom the cure putter line features adjustable weights for a fully customized putter sean zak walk around the pga show or even just peruse a golf retail store and you’ll find all kinds of adjustability in drivers everyone wants their driver to be their driver but what about putters adjustability in putters isn’t exactly innovative but poll your local country club and you’ll likely find a large majority of nonadjustable putters these things as we know feel great one day and not so great the next enter the cure putters rx series this unique brand of putters has been around for years allowing folks to determine how heavy and therefore how comfortable their putter head will be extra weighting which is added to the rear of the heel and toe of the club can adjust the weight of the three putters by upwards of  of course if you want something in the middle that’s also offered by cure the brand sells an extended weight kit for  that can even include colored weighting for the artsy players out there the adjustability is not relegated to weight alone the putter shaft connects with the putter head on a rotating block that can change the angle at which it connects sound confusing that just means your putter can feel much more upright or drop the grip toward a flatter angle the price of these putters  is serious business but when the adjustability offers more than a single setting to some it may be well worth it  sean zak swing shirt golfswingshirtcom the swing shirt is designed to keep your swing in sync sean steinemann chances are if you watch the golf channel you have seen the swing shirt commercial but it’s the story behind the training aid that is the best part ray rapcavage — a true golf addict in every sense of the word — was hitting balls in in the front yard of his new jersey home in midjanuary when he was hit with a mini case of the shanks determined to beat the dreaded “sword” ray took an old sweater turned it so the arm hole was positioned at his chest and then put both his arms through the one arm hole and began hitting balls the improvement was so astonishing that ray made his wife come out in the brutal winter cold to watch him hit balls four years later ray has sold tens of thousands of the americanmade swing shirts and pga tour player padraig harrington frequently practices with the shirt long story short if you’re looking for a more connected powerful golf swing — the swing shirt is for you and yes it actually works tried it myself  sean steinemann honma tw  honmagolfcom the largest and most forgiving in the new honma tw line that also includes   and  models the tw   features a thin rolled tin titanium face for increased ballspeeds and distance as well as a long shallow back shape to encourage higher launch angles weight that’s saved through the use of a lightweight crown is redistributed to an gram sole weight that’s located in a low forward portion of the clubhead the result is a cg that’s also low and forward encouraging very low spin rates that would normally be associated with smaller volume clubheads some of the saved weight is also positioned in the low heel area of the clubhead making the large clubhead easier to square at impact “this is a unique product” says adam sheldon gm of honma usa “any average to better player who wants one of the lowest spinning cc drivers would do well to get fitted for the tw ” the tw  driver is

church mission ultimately he was drafted by the philadelphia ers with the second overall pick behind chris webber and ahead of penny hardaway given the novelty of a foot center playing for the ers bradley was issued jersey number  philadelphias management saw bradley as a major project with huge longterm potential the team acquired legendary big man moses malone to serve as a mentor for bradley

he left school to serve as a mormon missionary after finishing a twoyear mission to australia he decided not to return to college basketball instead he entered the  nba draftcitation needed professional careeredit philadelphia ersedit bradley entered the professional ranks as one of the most intriguing and highly debated prospects in the history of the nba draft supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league critics argued that he would struggle in the nba due to his thin build listed at just  pounds and lack of experience just one season of college basketball followed by a twoyear hiatus from the sport due to his church mission ultimately he was drafted by the philadelphia ers with the second overall pick behind chris webber and ahead of penny hardaway given the novelty of a foot center playing for the ers bradley was issued jersey number  philadelphias management saw bradley as a major project with huge longterm potential the team acquired legendary big man moses malone to serve as a mentor for bradley hoping to develop his skills in the low post also the franchise hired strength and conditioning consultant pat croce and registered dietitian jeanie subach to add bulk to bradleys skinny frame his rookie season – produced mixed results in his first game bradley totaled just  points and  rebounds but he did manage to block  shots in  minutes it was a sign of things to come for much of his career bradley was inconsistent in scoring and rebounding but he always excelled at blocking shots he averaged  points  rebounds and  blocks per game in his first season – good enough to earn nba allrookie second team honors but he shot a dismal  percent from the floor and constantly struggled with turnovers and foul trouble he suffered a seasonending injury in february of that year dislocating his kneecap in a collision with portlands harvey grant bradley returned to full strength in his second season playing in all  games for the ers his scoring actually declined a bit  points per game but his rebounding and shotblocking increased he racked up  rejections setting a franchise record for most blocks in a single season bradley gave philly fans a glimpse of his potential in a contest against the los angeles clippers in november posting career highs of  points and  rebounds in a  victory he also tied a career high with  blocked shots and was credited with  additional intimidations as the clippers were held to their lowestever point total against the ers he finished the season in strong fashion posting  doubledoubles in his last  games new jersey netsedit however despite these highlights bradley continued to baffle and frustrate philadelphia with his inconsistent play just  games into his third season – the ers ended the shawn bradley experiment trading him to the new jersey nets for derrick coleman he played the final  games of the year with the nets and tantalized nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season in february he dominated a matchup against fellow giant gheorghe mureșan leading the nets to a  victory against the washington bullets bradley scored a seasonhigh  points over the foot mureşan and also added  rebounds and  blocked shots bradley lifted his game to new levels in march  he posted a careerhigh  points and added  rebounds against dallas early in the month and set another career high a week later with  blocked shots against the phoenix suns he recorded his first career tripledouble in the very next game tallying  points  rebounds and a careerbest  blocked shots in another matchup against mureşan and the bullets in april bradley posted backtoback tripledoubles against boston and toronto in the process he became the first player in nba history to record consecutive games of doublefigure blocked shots twice in a single season his season averages for – were  points  rebounds and  blocks per game – all career highs the nets began the – season under new management john calipari was named head coach in the offseason and john nash replaced willis reed as general manager reed had been a big believer in bradley but calipari and nash werent nearly as excited about the foot enigma in an effort to save some cash against the salary cap the nets traded their big center and his big contract to the dallas mavericks in a blockbuster midseason deal that involved nine players dallas mavericksedit bradley embraced yet another fresh start with a new franchise with increased playing time in dallas bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career in a game against the clippers he tied his career high by scoring  points – the most ever by a center in the history of the mavericks franchise he also added a seasonhigh  rebounds in that same contest he finished the year with averages of  points and  rebounds per game – breaking career highs set during the previous season but most importantly bradley provided strong defense in the paint that dallas had been lacking before his arrival in fact bradley finished the year as the top shotblocker in the entire league averaging  swats per contest it was the first time any mavericks player had ever led the nba in any statistical category and yet bradley continued to be plagued by maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career during the – season dallas coach jim cleamons experimented by bringing bradley off the bench in several games instead of his usual role as starter in one particular game it paid off in a major way bradley totaled  points  rebounds and a careerhigh  blocked shots in an april contest against the trail blazers bradley became the fifth nba player to record at least  points  rebounds and  blocks in a single game and the first to do so off the bench the previous players to record a  game with points rebounds and blocks were kareem abduljabbar elvin hayes hakeem olajuwon and shaquille oneal bradley finished the year with a teamrecord  blocked shots his average of  per game ranked third in the nba bradley played  more seasons in the league remaining with the mavericks until his retirement in  over that span his playing time slowly declined mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the teams lineups and rotations by coach don nelson in particular bradleys offensive role became very limited but he remained an imposing defensive presence in fact in the – season he broke his own team record by blocking  shots for dallas – the highest total in the nba that year the mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender mostly due to the rise of star players such as dirk nowitzki and steve nash but bradleys defense made a significant contribution he finished his career with averages of  points  rebounds and  blocks in  minutes of action per game international careeredit bradley has competed internationally for germany he and dallas teammate dirk nowitzki were members of the german national basketball team that finished in fourth place at the eurobasket  in turkey in order to participate in this tournament bradley made use of his german birth to obtain german citizenship postbasketball careeredit after his retirement as a player bradley became involved with west ridge academy a coeducational private school for atrisk youths in west jordan utah bradleys role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal counselor and coach describing bradley school executive director ken allen said shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids his instant credibility when hes talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor he is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful being so tall wasnt always easy for him he knows about being the odd kid and dealing with that on march   bradley filed papers to run as a republican against incumbent democratic rep tim

view report our first thoughts on the  ducati scrambler desert sled and triumph street scrambler  cycle world skip to main content subscribe subscribe to the magazine lifestyle our first thoughts on the  ducati scrambler desert sled and triumph street scrambler two bikes same country different rides what are the boys’ thoughts by bradley adams and sean macdonald posted jan th  at pm comments  ducati scrambler desert sled bradley adams this week sean and bradley had the unique opportunity to roll around the spanish desert with two of the latest and greatest scramblers those rides didn’t cross paths but seeing as how they were both in the same time zone and the guys werent sleeping anyway due to that whole jetlag thing we decided to set them up on slack and see what they had to say about the rides both are working on their full firstride reviews which you can and should read right here at cycleworldcom sometime this week in the meantime here are some of their initial sleepdeprived thoughts on two dramatically different takes on the scrambler design badams  pm hey princess you still awake sean  pm yeah bud just finished dinner and one or three drinks at the bar  i saw your posts on instagram youre really into that ducati huh badams  pm mmm they knocked it out of the park with this desert sled seriously sean  pm to be honest i sorta assumed it would be a performer but i still cant get into the looks guess that’s a personal thing and i’m just weird like that badams  pm its not always about looks sean but seriously performancewise its better than i even thought it would be really and truly offroad capable sean  pm alright alright tell me more then i wanna hear all about how it performs because i still dont believe it can perform that well badams  pm no really it does its completely and utterly raised the bar within the scrambler category ten minutes into the ride we were in this wash that wouldve eaten up anything else in the category and this thing just charged right through stand up shift your weight back and its more than willing to tackle the technical stuff im not saying its a dirt bike but im saying its x more capable than any other socalled scrambler out there right now triumph street scrambler sean macdonald sean  pm okay but what about rocks those freakin things are what always really get me what do you do about rocks badams  pm umm i avoid them like  sushi  why would you not  do you purposely hit those on a dirt bike like “oh a rock let me go torture my kidneys on that just for giggles… sean  pm hahahahaha  a suck a fart b sometimes you cant help it and there are rocks everywhere are you telling me you only rode on fire roads and some sand because lots of adv bikes will do that plenty fine badams  pm put it this way the first thing anyone said after our first stop was i cant believe they actually took us on this route  so sandy and technical  ducati scrambler desert sled bradley adams sean  pm dangit thats actually awesome  we did about a halfmile of dirt today and by dirt i mean fire road badams  pm yeah because the triumph is more about looks sean  pm okay hold on  a i love lists b you can just suck it right now c looks matter but so does on road performance and the triumph is awesome at that badams  pm but thats the thing this desert sled lost basically nothing in terms of onroad performance sean  pm yeah but seriously there were times today where i forgot i was on the hipsterjurassic world bike and thought i was on a supermoto albeit underpowered just sending it into corners triumph street scrambler sean macdonald badams  pm youd have sent it bigger on the desert sled  just my opinion sean  pm okay but the ducati was never that great of a road bike snatchy throttle and bouncy suspension you telling me all of that is fixed badams  pm throttle was actually smoother than i thought it would be the engine is all euro  compliant so there are some tweaks to the tuning and it helped suspension is a good balance between comfort and support and that extra travel front and rear is a godsend  remember ducati updated the chassis a bit too it’s stiffer the engine mounts to the frame different so there aren’t any issues with load when you jump the thing and the swingarm is longer  should we even be comparing performance on these bikes i mean theyre different customers arent they  like with the triumph is the guy buying that even intending to go offroad sean  pm not at all i mean its better off road than the last one but that isnt saying much  but  but  ducati scrambler desert sled bradley adams  its soooooo good on road like howling with laughterscreaming at our lead rider to go faster while scraping hard parts good  and its x better looking while doing so  i mean i dont go offroad that often on my daily ride and we have dual sports and dirt bikes for when we do so how is this not the best option for daily use the only option is if its somehow better on road thats the only way ill accept that it doesnt look even close to as nice badams  pm i wouldnt say better on road but its not any worse and heres the thing i ride motorcycles for the adventure if i see a dirt road leading off of a highway im absolutely  going to take that detour and i dont want to have to turn around the second said road gets a little technical  and thats why i like the desert sled so much nothings holding you back from going farther getting deeper into the desert having more fun  i literally laughed in my helmet  of today i like that i want more of that sean  pm so did i  but also youre the dude taking roads on a yamaha fj that i was on a ktm  adventure ryoud be fine on most things triumph street scrambler sean macdonald badams  pm i mean i dont find pleasure in taking things where they dont belong ill do it but i know i shouldnt be and that kind of sucks the fun out of it a bit with this thing you never feel like youre doing something you shouldnt be  for the sake of actually getting some sleep tonight though lets get to the nittygritty here what are the biggest takeaways from the ride on the triumph today  and yesyou can give me another freakin list if you want sean  pm hahahaha only if a is for you to shut up  no no heres the thing its just really good theyve reduced the weight a little but lowered the bike a lot it no longer feels like a big heavy bike in fact you no longer think about the size or weight  it keeps being if not more so the prettiest thing out there only now its fun easy to ride accessible and quick for all if people can get over the offroad thing then i think its the best one on the market at least if you want to ride something pretty instead of something japanese or expensive badams  pm but scramblerwise you mean sean  pm if you like classically styled things i mean  ducati scrambler desert sled bradley adams badams  pm okay got it i mean those are really really good points lighter weight less intimidating and pretty it does sound like a good package sean  pm its so good dude no more worrying about getting your feet down or managing the weight even at a stop no more of that feeling like when youre leaning back in a desk chair and it almost tips you know that feeling i’ve seen that fear in your face before hahaha  seriously though just confidence across the board at a stop and at lean and at  miles per hour wait didnt you say something about posting this badams  pm people would have stopped reading at your third list sean  pm whatever man question if you had to mark the scrambler desert sleds performance by something what would you liken it to badams  pm oh man my brains going to hurt trying to figure this one out sean  pm good you need to not be great at something every once in a while badams  pm maybe like a really really good klr with just a little less longrange comfort  is that bad i cant tell if thats a bad thing  i didnt mean for it to be everyone loves a klr triumph street scrambler sean macdonald sean  pm i hate the klr try again badams  pm yeah but would you hate a really really good klr sean  pm okay no that sounds lovely especially if it was italian and didnt give me speed wobbles on the freeway  also screw you for almost making me see your side badams  pm seriously think about it pretty good offroad better than any real streetoriented scrambler thing but more comfortable than an enduro so you can actually ride it a significant amount of street miles before jumping on a trail  coughbajatripcough sean  pm is this one of those things im not going to believe until i try it for myself  but then im going to agree with you wholeheartedly badams  pm yeah its basically like that  even grumpy sean will love it  ducati scrambler desert sled bradley adams sean  pm ugh youd think id learn badams  pm ha and honestly ill probably love the triumph too just in a different environment  im glad they both stepped it up this year i think both bikes are going to pump some muchneeded life back into the scrambler segment sean  pm yeah  i mean i believe you because you dont actually get excited about stuff that isnt awesome but i still think in the end i might choose pretty over real offroad capability i mean unless its ktm  or  excf good because thats all i really want to ride in the dirt  but who knows ducati may have created one bike to do it all getting you this excited is incredible enough as is badams  pm yeah yeah im hard to please we know  fair enough and ill admit there are some downsides like the weight and price  lbs sean  pm i could have a ktm for half that weight and that price and i could make it look cooler triumph street scrambler sean macdonald badams  pm but i think big picture its a step in a really cool direction the ds is the scrambler ive been wanting for years now and not only did ducati finally build it but they built it beyond our expectations  thats pretty cool to be able to say sean  pm for once youve said something i cant argue with badams  pm boom i win sean  pm not what i said badams  pm what i read  but okay im going to bed youre first ride going up soon  your  someones going to yell at me on fb about that sean  pm hahahahah how you made a mistake before me ill never know  and yeah itll be up soonish at least im faster than you at something badams  pm okay ill grab some five hour energy drinks soon as i get home and try to get mine up too then we can compare sean  pm deal  rad i’m signing off then  go desert sled  woo all the wins sean  pm i hate you  goodnight and see ya back in the office badams  pm i hate that i laughed at that and people are going to read the same thing and think we are idiots sean  pm yuuuuup badams  pm oh well the truth had to come out at some point but yes night bud see you back in irvine
