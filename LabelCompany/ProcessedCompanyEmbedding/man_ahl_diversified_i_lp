assumptions relating to the application of the partnerships critical accounting estimates other than those to be used would likely result in materially different amounts from those reported the partnerships significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  to the financial statements   offbalance sheet arrangements neither the partnership nor the trading company engages in offbalance sheet arrangements with other entities contractual obligations the partnership does not enter into contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments of a type that would be typical for an operating company or that would affect its liquidity or capital resources the partnerships sole business is trading futures contracts forward currency and other otc contracts both long contracts to buy and short contracts to sell and investing in cash and cash equivalents all of the partnerships futures forward and otc contracts other than certain currency forward

period to period management cannot predict whether the partnerships future net asset value per unit will increase or experience a decline the partnership was organized in september  under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act and commenced operations on april   performance summary the partnership is a speculative managed futures fund which trades pursuant to the ahl diversified program indirectly through its investment in the trading company the ahl diversified program is a futures and forward otc price trendfollowing trading system the ahl diversified program is entirely quantitative in nature and implements trading positions on the basis of statistical analyses of past price histories the ahl   diversified program like most trendfollowing systems is designed in the anticipation that most of its trades will be unprofitable the objective of overall profitability depends on the system identifying certain major trends which occur and recognizing significant profits from participating in such trends the past performance of the ahl diversified program is not necessarily indicative of its future results this is the case with all speculative trading strategies moreover the markets in which the ahl diversified program is active have seen major changes in recent years including the influx of entirely different classes of market participants these changed circumstances may mean that the markets in which the trading advisor has previously traded on behalf of the trading company are not necessarily representative of those in which it trades on behalf of the trading company currently as a speculative futures fund the partnership through the trading company effectively maintains all of its capital in reserve the trading company does not buy or sell futures or forward contracts in the traditional sense rather through taking positions in these markets the trading company and thus the partnership indirectly acquires lossprofit exposure and uses its capital to cover losses and provide margin which constitutes a good faith deposit towards the trading companys but not the partnerships obligation to pay such losses to support its open positions each of the partnership and the trading company maintains most of its capital in cash and cash equivalents futures trading programs are proprietary and confidential as is the case with any speculative futures fund it is impossible to predict how the partnership will perform it is not possible as it is in the case of an operating business to predict performance trends analyze future market conditions or evaluate the likely success or failure of the partnership there are certain general market conditions in which the partnership is more likely to be profitable than in others for example in trendless or stagnant markets the ahl diversified program is unlikely to be profitable on the other hand trending markets with substantial price change momentum can be favorable to the ahl diversified trading program however because of the continually changing population of market participants as well as supply and demand characteristics it cannot be predicted how the ahl diversified program and thus the partnership will perform in any given market conditions   dec  dec  ending equity     net assets decreased  for the year ended december   this decrease was attributable to

predominated the first quarter the partnership started off the year sustaining losses from its stock indices shorts in january subsequently achieved gains in february on account of long equity positioning and ended the quarter with additional losses driven by long   exposure to the sp  second quarter equity trading entailed similar volatility although the partnerships long exposure to heng seng and hshare futures in april capitalized on buoyant equity markets in hong kong and china  the partnerships long exposure to the eurozone suffered as uncertainty surrounding the greek debt crises negotiations produced spikes in volatility a shrinking global risk appetite as well as weakened business activity in china subsequently prompted selloffs in the asian and us markets which battered the partnerships long equity positions in both markets in the third quarter fourth quarter trading of equities also brought negative results as the news of a large and significant fall in the growth of the us workforce accompanied by the european central banks ecb failure to expand its asset purchases ran counter to the partnerships long equity positions with respect to fixedincome trading the partnership started off the year with strong first quarter returns in january canadas surprise cut to its benchmark interest rate and collapsing us bond yields contributed to making the partnerships bond and rate positions among the partnerships strongest profit drivers for the year despite moderate february losses on account of investor demand shifting from bonds to equities march bond trading proved profitable as the ecbs massive asset purchase program and accommodative remarks from us federal reserve chair janet yellen favored the partnerships long exposure to the us and european bond markets the second quarter however brought a reversal of fortunes as the partnership suffered losses from strong swings in the german bond market unprofitable short positions in australian bonds and continuing investor uncertainty regarding the greek debt crisis the partnership thereafter experienced a return to profitability in the fixedincome sector as the partnerships positions in italian bonds and eurodollars produced substantial positive returns and overshadowed july losses sustained from short us treasury positions although the partnerships european bond positions achieved gains in october notable volatility in december resulted in losses for the partnerships german italian and french bond positions at the end of the year relative to the partnerships experience in the equities and fixedincome sectors commodity trading produced more favorable returns in  but was similarly hampered by sharp price reversals throughout the year in january returns from the partnerships commodity positions were neutral as losses sustained in the agricultural sector offset gains achieved in the energy markets this offsetting relationship subsequently reversed in february as short oil exposure suffered from substantial and swift price increases while the partnerships agricultural positions produced gains the prices of oil and oilrelated products reversed course again in march falling significantly from a strong february rally and buoying the partnerships march results following a neutral month of commodity trading in april quick reversals in the agricultural markets in may and june resulted in substantial losses for the partnership long exposure to base metals and short agricultural positions produced particularly large losses during this period as zinc prices dropped around  following a  rally in march and midmonth heavy rains and flooding across growing regions damaged crops and generally reversed a steady price decline which had taken place during the first part of the year in july a subsequent long us dollar trend and heightened prospects of iranian oil entering the global markets supported the partnerships gold energies crude oil gasoline and diesel shorts the partnerships short exposure to coal and electricity generated gains in august as each maintained their downward trend despite shortterm reversals in oil prices september trading additionally produced profits as continued reports of weakened chinese business activity and growing expectations of shrinking chinese demand for commodities benefitted the partnerships short positions in oil and industrial metals the theme of falling oil prices and overall depressed commodity demand continued to drive the partnerships trading successes during the fourth quarter as the partnership realized gains from its shorts in natural gas oil and metals these profits were partially reduced by losses sustained from short positions in live cattle and december shortterm trend reversals although starting off the first quarter with positive momentum currency trading produced net losses over the course of  as heightened volatility and swift market corrections during the second and fourth quarters proved challenging for the partnerships trendfollowing approach in january long us dollar positions against the euro and uk pound each returned gains which were augmented by positive returns from february trading in the foreign currency markets this profitable run continued in march due to the partnerships short exposure to the brazilian real which was negatively affected by the countrys continuing political scandals and economic   troubles the second quarter however produced a sharp reversal in trading returns in april the partnerships long us dollar positions against several g markets suffered as the value of the euro jumped approximately  from prior lows although gains realized from short exposure to the japanese yen helped to offset these may losses june trading experienced a continuing run of negative results on account of the partnerships us dollar positioning in july the partnership subsequently returned to profitability in the currencies sector as a long us dollar trend arising from reports of favorable us economic data and the prospect of higher us interest rates benefitted the partnerships short positions in gold and foreign currencies relative to the us dollar with the us dollar continuing to strengthen on account of investor flight from emerging market currencies to the comparative safety of the us  the partnerships continuing short exposure to foreign currencies such as the brazilian real south korean won and the australian dollar produced substantial returns in august these gains were partially offset by losses sustained during september currency trading the partnership thereafter ended the year with moderately negative results from fourthquarter currency trading as the partnership experienced offsetting returns in october and november while december trading produced losses from a swift rallying of the euro trading in the credit sector although having a neutral impact during most of the year served as a slight drag on the partnerships overall performance during  protective positioning in investment and higher yield credit index swaps provided positive returns in february but these gains were subsequently outweighed by moderate losses sustained during the remaining quarters of the year  net assets decreased  for the year ended december   this decrease was attributable to subscriptions in the amount of  redemptions in the amount of  and net income from operations of  for the year ended december   the partnership accrued or paid total expenses of  including  in servicing fees  in general partner

the partnerships investments produced overall noteworthy results in  with particularly strong performance achieved in the fixedincome sector the key themes that influenced the partnerships bond trading were the increasingly accommodative monetary policy of the ecb as well as the continued interventionist strategies employed by the united states and japan  in january existing long positions in french and italian bond futures as well as eurobund and canadian contracts provided the most significant returns long italian and french positions thereafter buoyed the partnerships fixedincome results for march in the face of sharp reversals in both the eurodollar and us treasury bond markets trading profits in the second quarter were similarly driven by the ecbs accommodative stance relative to the continued stimulus tapering by the united states  as desire for higher yields increased investor demand back to the us and other bond markets in may the partnership realized profits from its long us and australian bond positions although a long stake in us treasuries subsequently produced losses in june corresponding long positions in european bonds offset these losses with the rallying of european markets in july and august the partnerships long positions in europe and the united states generated positive returns as investors sought security in safehaven assets and federal reserve chair janet yellen and ecb president mario draghi respectively noted the commitment of the us to low shortterm interest rates and the ecbs intention to pursue a more active interventionist stance to boost growth and prevent deflation september and the first part of october subsequently brought notable volatility and losses   but bond trading ultimately ended the year on a strong note the partnership generated positive returns in each month of the fourth quarter from its long positions in the rallying japanese and canadian bond markets and as its investments proved welltimed to take advantage of the ecbs firstever purchases of assetbacked debt continued deflationary risks and increased stresses to oil producing countries from falling energy prices in contrast to the bond sector the partnerships equity positions generated mixed results in  investor concern over the withdrawal of us stimulus the varied strategies of central banks geopolitical developments and the arrival of lower input prices for energy and raw materials were the major performance drivers during this period the partnership started off the year with losses from its long positions as both the european and us equity markets experienced declines and germanys dax index in particular was subject to sharp reversals due to the uncertainty borne out of the russianukrainian political conflict after continuing to create losses in april following the bursting of a ministock bubble equity trading provided substantial gains in the second quarter as the partnerships long positions in us and european equities rose in conjunction with the sp s and the dax indexs respective climbs to alltime highs these long positions created losses in the third quarter however following the argentine debt default that prompted a selloff in global equities and comments from janet yellen concerning stretched valuations in certain markets the mixedresults pattern continued in the fourth quarter with its whipsaw market conditions in october investor anxiety over the end of the federal reserves asset purchasing program and the arrival of the first case of ebola ever recorded in the united states brought a sharp fall in equity prices which subsequently rebounded in november with the arrival of lower input prices for energy and raw materials conversely lower energy prices and the resulting stresses they engendered for countries dependent on oil revenue prompted a global sell off in equities in december by midmonth equities once more rallied this time on janet yellens remarks that there would be no upcoming surprises with respect to interest rates the partnership sustained losses during this volatile fourth quarter commodity trading produced similarly mixed results with respect to agriculturals the partnership realized modest gains overall with trading in specific months comprising a significant portion of the partnerships performance attribution from this sector in june and july long cattle and short corn and wheat positions were welltimed to take advantage of recordhigh futures prices for cattle and the downward trend of grain values which had spiked on earlier concerns over the harsh winter reversals in the grain markets however as well as in the longer trends seen in cocoa trading produced losses for the partnership in october with respect to energies trading initially contributed modestly to the partnerships performance but by the end of the third quarter became increasingly profitable as fundamental demand and supply principles in contrast to global risk appetite appeared to drive the energy sector more than any other time since the financial crisis the partnerships short positions in oil were particularly profitable during this period as energy prices already suppressed in october on account of the strengthening us dollar and weaker global growth plummeted in november with opecs decision to maintain levels of oil production despite the rapid decline in oil prices the theme of falling energy prices persisted in december and the partnerships continued short positions remained favorable in contrast to the partnerships favorable fourthquarter run in the energy sector metals trading accounted for a much smaller portion of the partnerships  performance attribution and shorts in gold and silver produced losses due to fears of weakening growth and geopolitical instability in the middle east  trading in currencies resulted in positive returns for the partnership in  with some of the key themes including the continuing growth of the us economy europes and japans stimulus initiatives and falling oil prices although currency trading started off to a slow start the second half of the year yielded notable gains as short positions taken on the japanese yen euro and the currencies of other struggling economies added sizable returns in light of the currencies notable depreciation relative to the us dollar the interest rates and credit sectors had a minor influence on performance in  and aside from metals comprised the sectors with the smallest partnership allocations    net assets decreased  for the year ended december   this

asset value of a class b unit increased by  to  trading in bonds and short term interest rates started off with losses in january  the main detractors being long positions in us treasuries french bonds short sterling and eurodollar however bond trading returned to profitability in february as markets returned to a more cautious state following januarys bullish nature safe haven bonds such as us treasuries returned some of the larger gains with returns also coming from emerging market bonds long interest rate positions such as in eurodollar euribor and short sterling further provided positive results because of the relaxed monetary policies of major central banks in march bond trading largely continued this positive run due to the portfolios long bond holdings a small portion of the gain however was lost via italian long dated bonds and positions in us treasuries in april a long exposure to fixed income assets including european bonds us treasuries and eurodollar contracts again delivered profits despite a loss on long exposures to japanese bonds the partnership subsequently sustained a loss in may primarily because of its long exposure to us treasuries uk gilts and bonds from commodity focused economies long exposure to interest rate holdings also incurred a loss following a cut in eurozone rates indeed eurodollar euribor and short sterling contracts all ended may in negative territory the partnership continued to post a loss in june on account of its long holdings of us treasuries european bonds and contracts involving eurodollar euribor and short sterling in august rising yields hurt long exposure to us treasuries which was one of the largest negatives over the month similarly bond holdings hurt performance in september as short exposure to debt from commodityfocused economies suffered long holdings of italian bonds further delivered a loss with destabilization of the italian coalition government resulting in heavy selling of the countrys debt some performance was recovered via long german and french bonds as higher grade fixed income attracted safe haven inflows from investors nevertheless bond trading ultimately ended the year in december on a sour note as bond prices dropped following the federal reserves reduction in bond purchasing integral in its quantitative easing policy in contrast to bond and interest rate trading equity positions largely generated positive results for the partnership in  equity trading provided noteworthy results in january because of long equity exposure across all regions including the us and european indices such long exposure continued to generate solid performance throughout the year although losses were sustained in us and european stock indices when equities fell out of favor with respect to currency trading short exposure to japanese yen provided positive returns in january as the japanese yen fell  on a tradeweighted basis following the announcement of stimulus and deflation control currency trading in february however provided mixed results as positive returns from shorting the british pound was offset by losses from short exposure to the us dollar continued trading strategies with respect to both the british pound and us dollar produced the opposite effects in the months of march and april in march the short exposure to the us dollar largely resulted in positive returns while in april short positions in the british pound produced negative returns when the united kingdom avoided a tripledip recession currency trading became a notable performance detractor in the months following in july long exposure to the us dollar suffered due to the uss continuing accommodative monetary policy in august losses were concentrated in   long eurodollar positions as betterthanexpected data raised eurozone interest rate expectations the losses sustained in september were attributable to long exposure to the us dollar dollar pairs against emergingmarket currencies and both long and short euro exposures short exposure to eurodollar and short sterling particularly suffered as accommodative monetary policy in the us lowered expectations for interest rates globally commodity trading started off the year generating a gain largely due to short electricity contracts as milder wetter weather drove prices down long exposure to oil and oil derivatives and short gold exposure also returned positive numbers energy trading took a hit in february though with all positions contributing to the loss long positions in crude oil crude oil byproducts and base metals followed the same theme in march the commodity allocations also delivered negative performance on the whole driven predominantly by a long exposure to energy markets exposure to crude oil and its derivatives caused the greatest losses as the portfolio was long at the start of the period and suffered as oil prices fell the portfolios exposure was subsequently reduced and thus did not participate in some of the upward movement towards the end of the period although some profits were obtained through a short allocation to both precious and base metals in april exposure to wheat and corn detracted from these gains conversely agricultural trading in may posted a gain primarily through long soybeans and short sugar positions energies produced slightly negative returns in may with long natural gas adding a loss that short electricity and coat contacts partially offset in june short metals added a notable gain as prices of both base and precious metals fell sharply the reverse was true in july when chinese growth figures pushed up the price of base metals and precious metals also rose short positions in agriculturals similarly generated a loss from increased prices in cocoa coffee and soya commodity trading in august produced mixed results as early gains from long exposures were lost after increased industrial production in china hurt short positions in base metals september provided similarly mixed results while short exposure to precious metals suffered losses agricultural holdings produced positive results overall high midwest temperatures threatened to damage soyabean crops and resulted in strong returns from long exposures to soyabeans short corn positions further turned out to be profitable from largerthanexpected stockpiles of corn returns on energy trades were mixed as middle east tensions created profit on long holdings of crude oil and oil prices subsequently dropped commodity trading in october also produced a loss as volatility in energy markets caused difficulties for directional trading in contrast short metal holdings generated positive gains in november after the price of gold and aluminum dropped throughout the month long soyabean holdings additionally helped performance as us export demand increase in the month of december long crude oil holdings weighed the most on commodity trading profitability after western countries and iran reached an agreement over irans nuclear program the partnership however still benefited from short positions on canola and wheat which sold off strongly through the month trading on metals produced mixed results in december the credit sector provided mixed performance results in  short exposure to european and us credit default protection initially captured gains in january as the cost of default insurance fell but subsequently created losses after the cost of european default protection rose the partnership did achieve positive gains in the credit sector during the fourth
