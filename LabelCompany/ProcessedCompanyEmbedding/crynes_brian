well as professional development especially when many if not most of the limits are selfimposed tracy agrees with what henry ford observed long ago whether you think you can or think you cant youre

learned interview with brian crofts vp of product at namely by brian crofts vp of product at namely this post is part of a series of interviews that we are conducting with product leaders across various industries in this interview series product leaders share their advice with their fellow product managers we hope this series will shed light on trends and challenges in the profession and be helpful to new and experienced product managers alike the following is a conversation with brian crofts vp of product at namely namely is a fastgrowing allinone hr platform before namely brian held a variety of product management and finance roles at intuit here’s brian’s story how did you get into product management brian crofts bc i started my career at intuit as a corporate finance intern like most people i didn’t go to school for product management i studied economics and finance and discovered pm later i considered several career paths after college but in the end i chose to stay in finance early on i saw a product manager on stage at an intuit allhands and i thought “that guy has the best job” the product manager was a great story teller he articulated a clear customer problem and had deep empathy for the customer’s pain he then shared his vision on how to solve that problem in a compelling way i knew i wanted a career in product a year later i was building my first mobile application we solved big customer problems at intuit — we built software to help consumers feel confident about doing their own taxes for example we were tackling that kind of customer challenge guided by a specific business model — working with great designers and the best engineers as a product manager being at the intersection of the customer the technology and the business in my mind was the closest thing to being a general manager a lot of people describe the product manager’s role as the “ceo of the product” what do you make of that moniker what leadership challenges do you think product managers face bc leadership can be a hard thing to define my prior ceo always said “your title makes you a manager but the people decide whether or not you’re a leader” i think that makes a lot of sense generally speaking people want to be led in product management you lead by understanding customer pain and advocating to solve it driving towards the best idea and then ultimately building that solution in a timely manner engineers designers and the team want to solve the problem and at the end of the day they are looking to be led being a leader is not the same as being opinionated it’s about the desire to “get it right” not just “be right” and while many people are working in the business it’s important as a leader to constantly working on the business these statements can be cliche but they’ve always mattered to me and the combination of the two is when we move from people working hard every day to working towards something that really matters — and is customerdriven databacked do that day after day year after year and the probabilities of success dramatically improve tweet this “being a leader is not the same as being opinionated it’s about the desire to ‘get it right’ not just ‘be right” being a leader isn’t something that just happens it’s something that you develop over time and by experience — by succeeding and failing it’s actionoriented we follow people who have a vision who make decisions and who move what do you love about your job and what is the most challenging part bc earlier in my career it was all about launching new products and that was fun but it was a new process for me and i didn’t have much confidence like anything it’s been a maturation process and so those first few times it was so exciting just to get a feature released or to get a new product launched — and see customers using them i think it’s so true in every aspect of life you get to a point where you can look back reflect and ask “what was the best part of that experience” there’s of course a big payoff when you launch something and people really love it but if you didn’t enjoy the part where you were solving the problem — where you were working with customers and poring over spreadsheets and looking at data and trying to synthesize it into insights eric ries calls it “the photo montage” — then you’re just not going to be a good product manager if you don’t like that part you should find a different gig i have much more confidence in the process — and a strong point of view on what that process entails today i get just as much satisfaction seeing the members of my team develop as leaders as i do launching a new product for the most part my team is my product as far as the most challenging aspect of my job i think it’s surprising how much of the job demands effective and efficient communication to be a successful product manager you need to communicate not only what the vision is and what it is we’re building but why we’re building it read simon sinek’s start with why and because we’re agile and because we’re always changing and constantly getting new data and insights it becomes imperative that we bring stakeholders along this often requires some kind of cadence or op mech within the company i use productplan to help facilitate the communication of what we’re doing when we’re doing it and ultimately why we’re doing it as a crossfunctional team we review the roadmap together every month in the earlier days of my career i underappreciated the communication aspect of the job but at the same time if i had just done it effectively i would have had an easier time — more time focused on building i used to spend all my days managing stakeholders — and that’s not right there’s a balance that needs to be struck and we’re doing that here at namely one of the first things i worked on when i got here at namely was reimagining how we communicate both internally and externally that involves getting different tools different processes and getting people alignedtrained on the new way when it comes to customers our communication also needs to be agile and contextual and nonobtrusive these are things that people don’t typically think about — they think product management is just about building products but it’s so much more how do you manage conflicting priorities within your organization bc there’s a threepart answer to this first teams need to operate under guiding principles — principles the organization is aligned to for example availability compliance security are usually the top of the list and are highly prioritized that sounds easy but it can be difficult once you get past the “nonnegotiables” soon after joining namely our cto and i worked to get aligned with the other leaders on how we’d prioritize our backlog it required aligning first on our product vision and strategy apart from aligning on principles it’s important to bring data to the discussion the most ineffective meetings are those when decisions get made or missed because the loudest person in the room influences everyone else meanwhile key insights and data points have the answer or can at least aid a decision for example your data may show that users are dropping off at the top of the funnel and nobody’s converting past the homepage so why are you debating the user experience later on what does it matter if there is no conversion good data and insights can open up the conversation and keep it objective and finally when i say make customerbacked decisions i mean bringing empathy back into the process and reminding people why we’re doing what we’re doing i think that can also help unstick people when it comes to conflicting priorities it’s also really important to understand the role of escalation if there is a debate amongst leadership it’s ultimately up to the ceo to be the tie breaker that’s a role our ceo plays and an example of how effective escalation can be it isn’t always a democracy — the reality is we need to make decisions i think understanding that is very healthy escalation is not a negative thing it’s just about getting to decisions so that teams can commit to those decisions and focus on execution our ceo plays that role well here at namely what tools or software can you not live without bc i’ve learned to love a good whiteboard and marker i have one on wheels so i often take it with me i’ve got one whiteboard out here in our working area and i’ve got another one that sits right by my desk i like whiteboards because ideas seem to flow when jotting them down i do most of my writing there i’ve still yet to find a good “digital whiteboard” for online collaboration i know they exist but nothing i’ve incorporated into my toolset i also use evernote but mostly for sketching i use evernote  ipad to sketch out everything from new org charts to product sketches–to sketches of my presentations i usually will sketch out my whole deck before i actually put it together similar to building a product i view everything as a product — whether it’s a deck or whether it’s a team the idea is that anything that’s early stage needs to be lower fidelity i used to have a moleskine notebook but now that i have the ipad pro i mostly use that for example i’ll sketch out a deck in evernote go over it with our ceo and make real time edits without ever having committed anything to powerpoint that kind of rapid iteration process — going from low to increasing fidelity as i get more solid on the answer — that’s how i operate in every aspect of my life even my goals for next year are written in evernote not typed but written with my messy pen because it denotes the lower fidelity eventually those goals will end up nice and typed out in evernote and then in our namely platform i think all of these tools are pretty common for product managers it’s how we use them differently that’s probably the more interesting i’ve got four or five trello boards for instance i use them for personal todos and admin todos in the business and then i’ve got more strategiclevel boards i even have a family board where my kids actually have little things to work on the highlevel kanban format gives me a sense of understanding of what’s going on and what we’ve got coming up describe your organization’s roadmap planning process how far out do you plan  bc like i mentioned earlier the first step was getting everybody aligned on how we’re going to prioritize then we simply shared those prioritization principles with the team at an allhands meeting and talked through the highlevel game plan and how we as the leadership team were aligned although it was very high level there were decisions made we were more explicit on what’s inwhat’s out for this next year after we distributed the product vision and principles the teams came back and shared their first draft of their roadmap we pushed them a little bit on vision we asked if it was aggressive enough we made sure it was core to our platform etc the best part was seeing how collaboratively these teams worked across design product and engineering — and then collaborating with the rest of the business for feedback it showed in the final result the team’s roadmaps were very much in line with our strategy we focus on six months at a time say  confidence for the stuff in q and  confidence for q in productplan i use milestones to show the beginning of the quarters and on there i actually write the percent level of confidence this is our way of communicating with marketing for example to say “hey this is what we’re going ship but don’t take it to the bank” marketing would never look at q features and communicate them to prospects in any way but they at least know where we think we’re headed and they can give us feedback on it tweet this “the worst thing is becoming beholden to a document that was wrong to begin with” it might be the case that we don’t ship what’s on the roadmap i think the worst thing is becoming beholden to a document that was wrong to begin with just because that’s the nature of how we work so that’s something we’re trying to break up in years past it was like “here’s the roadmap and success for everybody means shipping everything on the roadmap” but ultimately it’s about getting closer to solving our customer’s pain that is how we are measuring success that’s our approach — and i think it’s pretty similar to how we did things at intuit i’m taking some of the best practices we had previously but also realizing i can move even faster here at namely how do you incorporate customer feedback into your roadmap bc here’s the thing usually when customers give me feedback on stuff i already know that it’s broken or that the user experience is bad it’s either already on our roadmap or it’s not because it just hasn’t hit the priority list yet we have work constraints and limited resources so everything on the roadmap has been prioritized and there obviously has to be a cut line somewhere but the thing that steers the roadmap more than anything is customer insights what i mean by customer insights is actually spending time with customers and observing how they use the product and how they solve problems using a variety of tools — even what they do with paper going onsite in their office and actually observing what customers are doing is so much more valuable than just listening to what they say if i’m on a phone call with somebody i can’t see their environment let’s say i’m working on document management and i’m talking to someone about how they use document management software i’m listening and i’m thinking they’re probably paperfree but then i go onpremise and see they have all kinds of file cabinets that leads me to my next step of discovery having the contextual references and seeing their environment can lead to insights when you watch them use your product in their space you see their stress — you see how they feel and you see the emotional side of it whereas on the phone they might just tell you “yeah i use it it’s a good product” what are some big mistakes that you’ve seen product managers make or mistakes you’ve made yourself bc one mistake i made happened not too long ago when we had just launched the french version of quickbooks during the setup experience or the first time user experience there was a period where the app would stall and spin for over a minute it was a terrible user experience and i remember coming onto that team and thinking “ugh that’s not very good” but then i got caught up in the day job even though i knew it was not a good setup experience i just accepted the status quo and focused elsewhere as a product manager you need to be the person that advocates for good design and a good product or nobody will tweet this “as a pm you need to be the person that advocates for good design and a good product or nobody will” it took an embarrassing demo with a customer and a senior executive to bring it back to our attention we all looked at each other and knew we could only blame ourselves for accepting the status quo so that’s a trap that i’ve fallen into — and i’ve seen others fall into as well at the end of the day we need to be advocates we need to advocate for the customer and for great user experiences and for great products we need to always be raising the bar if you could give only one piece of advice to a new product manager what would it be bc we’ve talked a lot about making decisions and leading but i think product managers who really excel are those who also find a way to build handinhand with engineers and designers we can be builders too product managers should understand what it means to be a builder that may mean learning to become more technical or it may mean learning how to lead design thinking it’s important to establish that role as you lead a pm who is more technical usually pulls their own sql queries to better understand customer usage trends in doing that you’re gathering information that’s helpful to ensure you’re building and investing in the right areas design thinking is the process of developing deep customer empathy and insight and then building something that customers will love — and that’s being a builder as well it’s not just about writing good user stories or setting a good vision it’s about actually getting your hands dirty and building sketching out designs observing customers sitting in on sales calls this is the right step in the evolution of product management i would advise aspiring product managers to develop those skills in your undergrad learn how to code or learn how to design even if you ultimately want to become a product manager you need to have technical chops — and you need to know how to actually build stuff you have been involved in bringing new products to market for quite some time how has product management changed over the years bc i think macro shifts used to happen every  years but now they seem to be happening every six months — whether it’s the sharing economy or the gig economy the world and its markets are changing faster you look at all the newer companies that are driving the highest value and they’re all network effects airbnb doesn’t own a single room uber doesn’t own a single car even productplan — you’re shifting from a featurebased approach to more of a platform you now are spending more time building the pipes because those pipes — and being at the center of those pipes — are actually much more valuable you’re bringing much larger ecosystems together than if you just built a point solution this was a criteria i used when deciding which startup to join i wanted to build a platform and that is what we are doing at namely we have our core products but we are becoming more of an open platform to connect rd party apps it becomes a platform that is personalized to fit each of our client’s business needs we are early in that journey but are making great progress post comments  comments brian a february   at  pm reply great stuff brian awesome to
