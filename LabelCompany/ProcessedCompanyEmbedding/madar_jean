quarter results net sales were  million up  from  million at comparable foreign currency exchange rates net sales increased  sales by european based operations rose  to  million from  million sales by us based operations increased  to  million compared to  million gross margin was  of net sales compared to  and sga expenses as a percentage of net sales was  compared to last years  operating income

as previously reported net income attributable to inter parfums inc in the  first quarter included a nonrecurring settlement of  million tax assessment with the french tax authorities excluding the effect of the settlement  first quarter net income attributable to inter parfums inc was  million or  per diluted share we covered key sales drivers in our releases so i will concentrate this discussion on profitability factors for european operations gross profit margin was  and  in the first quarters of  and  respectively the overall decrease in gross margin is a result of product mix and increased cost relating to purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions for european operations such promotions aggregated  million and  million for the three months ended march   and  and represented  and  of net sales respectively i should also point out that the average dollareuro exchange rate for the three months ended march   was  as compared to  for the  period which added approximately  million to gross margin but that was offset by approximately  million of inventory sold to the balmain brand at cost in connection with the license buyout for us operations gross profit margin was  and  in the first quarters of  and  respectively with margin expansion primarily due to increased sales of higher margin prestige products under license sga expenses increased  and represented  of net sales for the first quarter of  as compared to  in the first quarter of last year for european operations sga rose  and for us operations sga rose  promotion and advertising included in sga aggregated approximately  million or  of net sales for the  first quarter and that compares to  million or  of net sales for the same period one year earlier the increase related to the new product launches and rollouts in the current first quarter operating income rose  and our operating margin in the current first quarter was  compared to last years  we closed the quarter with working capital of  million including approximately  million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments and  million of longterm debt including current maturities which was incurred in connection with the  rochas brand acquisition finally assuming the dollar remains at current levels we expect  net sales to be in the  million and  million range and net income attributable to inter parfums inc to be between  to  per diluted share jean please continue jean madar thank you russ and good morning everyone as we have already said this was an exceptional quarter that holds true for sales by geographic markets our two largest markets western europe and north america both achieved  yearoveryear sales growth while our third largest asia grew sales by  even our smaller markets the middle east central and south america and eastern europe had comparable quarter sales growth specifically   and more than  respectively one thing we know firsthand is that our commitment to maintaining or perhaps gaining market share for advertising and promotion in two difficult markets of  mainly china and russia has paid off very well this year for the remainder of the year our launch plans include the third legend pillar for montblanc called legend night that will debut at the end of this year and rollout further in  weve got a first coach scent for men debuting also in the fall and as i pointed out on our last conference call we are repositioning our lagerfeld fragrance enterprise to be more accessible more democratic and affordable starting with a new fragrance duo this year for lanvin we are readying a new interpretation of our top selling eclat darpege i will also give you a peek into  plans which includes our first new mens scent for rochas along with extension for jimmy choo illicit eclat darpege and coach for women moving onto the us operations abercrombie  fitch and hollister fragrances have been and are expected to continue to be the growth catalyst in  and also in  in march our womens edition of abercrombie  fitch first instinct debuted exclusively at worldwide ph duty free in the uk and the international rollout is now underway hollister wave  launched this spring and is now in broad geographic distribution we also have a new dunhill fragrance called icon racing launching later this year and for oscar de la rent the new fragrance called bella blanca will hit the market very later this year and early next year we also have several new products planned for our other niche brands including agent provocateur and bebe with turnaround in asia for anna sui especially in china we have a new fragrance called fantasia ph that will debut later this year and will target china as well as the greater asian market before taking your questions id like to share some of our thoughts about our industry and our place within it if you google fragrance launches of  you will find  new entries coming up on one website i know there is a lot of hype around new fragrance launch but in our experience new is good but longevity is much better recurring sales of fragrance that are on the market for years achieved significant returns for us and we have a number of these successes in our portfolio we will continue to fortify these fragrance gems with brand extension and flankers as well as new packaging and inspired promotion we saw a recent report indicating that the global fragrance industry was valued at approximately  billion in  while the industrys five year compound annual growth rate contracted  during that timeframe our net sales compounded annual growth rate was  i think that says something about our ability to buck trends and market share and grow our company we look to the remainder of the year with confidence in knowing we have a rich and diverse portfolio of brand we have the financial strength to partner with acquire or license additional brands we have an effective distribution network reaching more than  countries and in several of the most important markets we own or control the distribution organizations and of course we have a great talent and resource reservoir now operator you can open the lines for questions questionandanswer session operator at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from joe altobello of raymond james please proceed with your question joseph altobello thank you good morning guys jean madar hi joe joseph altobello first question i guess just curious obviously a strong start to the year how does the first quarter compare to what you guys were expecting internally since you didnt update your guidance russell greenberg im sorry can you just repeat that for a second i didnt hear the end of your joseph altobello yes i was just curious how the first quarter compare to your internal expectations coming into the year russell greenberg overall i think that the first quarter was pretty much in line from a sales standpoint there were a couple of brands that did a little bit better but knowing what our launch schedule was the first quarter was actually probably the easiest comparison if you look back to what weve done in the first quarter of  so from an overall standpoint its pretty much in line with what we expected joseph altobello okay you also mentioned that youre saying improved trends in russia and china how much of that is the market improvement how much of that is increased spending on the part of inter parfums jean madar i think we have a conjunction of both you remember that for the last i will say at least  months the chinese market for fragrance was depressed but we have continued to invest in promotion and in keeping our shelf space and when i see the comeback from the market in the first quarter and continuing into second quarter and we have also a better idea for this going to happen for the year we are very  how should i say relieved regarding our business in china russia i will say is similar we have decided to continue to spend heavily in russia well do some tv campaigns as early as august or september so its a  i will say that the environment is much better and our business is quite good joseph altobello okay great just one last question and i apologize if i missed this the coming of the launch of legend night is it late this year or early next year jean madar we will ship legend night in the fourth quarter of this year we will ship coach for men in the third quarter of this year this is the plan we have joseph altobello okay great thank you guys jean madar thank you operator our next question comes from frank camma with sidoti  company please proceed with your question frank camma good morning guys jean madar good morning frank camma a question i have on coach i mean youve gotten off to a good start but it seems to me and maybe im biased because im a us consumer but i mean it seems to me to be one of your best recognized brands at least usbased is there anything that would stop you from maybe pushing advertising spend maybe a little harder to ramp up sales there just kind of curious on where that can go over time jean madar the budget our advertising budget for coach is very very high comparing to sales you do  maybe you dont see  we are spending in the us but dont forget were also spending in other market where the brand is maybe less strong were spending in europe and we are also spending in asia where the brand has great recognition but as a percentage of sales i can tell you that the amount of advertising and marketing that we are spending on coach is quite high frank camma okay my second question is for russ russ you called out a number of factors for the gross margin but the one that stuck out to me is the  you mentioned in the press release and what you mentioned about the purchase the gift purchases i dont remember you calling that out before in the first quarter at least i mean thats typically like a q thing right can you just explain why that was particularly because it wasnt really a dramatic change as a percentage of sales like why that had an impact on the quarter russell greenberg youre right normally when we talk about purchase with purchase and gift with purchases we talk about during the holiday season or certainly during the third quarter because thats where a significant amount of that spending takes place but we do have programs that we do throughout the year and because of some of the launches that weve had there was more of it in the first quarter this year than we had in prior years and i just wanted to point that out as one of the reasons for the small decline in margin the margin decline in the european operations was relatively small especially when you take into account this  million ph of the balmain brand at cost frank camma right right russell greenberg so i was really just looking for reasons to explain why the margin declined a little bit in a period where your dollar gained a little bit of strength because one might have thought it should have gone the other way so i was really kind of drawing at things to explain frank camma okay i understood okay just to kind of clarify like we should still expect there should  you would have your typical seasonal pattern with gift sets in q i would assume i mean barring anything unusual russell greenberg thats correct your gift sets are a little bit different than your purchase with purchase and gift with purchase kind of promotions frank camma i got you okay thank you russell greenberg no problem frank operator our next question comes from jason gere of keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question jason gere thanks good morning i guess i want to go back to the eps guidance and i know that its early in the season but not changing after what seemed to be a nice beat does imply that the rest of the year that earnings would be down yearoveryear so i guess if i dissect that a little bit i guess im trying to understand is your ap expense beyond the  that i think you guys talked about do you not see sga  or is sga going to go higher are there other like investments in capabilities like ecommerce or things like that that you need to do so again i understand why you didnt raise guidance after this quarter but i guess im trying to understand and peel back the layers of the onion to look at should we expect earnings to be down yearoveryear for the rest of the year based on what the guidance implies russell greenberg well if im correct and i could be wrong the guidance implies somewhere either plus or minus  depending upon which part of the range that youre in as far as the earnings guidance but i think its more difficult than that what drives the earnings is really your sales volume all right and this is where we really need to be a little bit conservative as we move into q q and q we are comparing ourselves to significant growth that we saw in q and q and q of  to give you an example european operations in q of  grew  the us operations were up  in q europe was  us was  all right in q europe was  and the us was  this was all driven by major launches of coach of rochas of abercrombie and hollister these are creating very very difficult comparisons now we are hopeful that we will continue to show growth in the sales line but going into these periods we really need to be very very conservative because these are very difficult comparisons to deal with so far  i mean dont get me wrong april looks really good the sales are a little bit better that we originally expected but i can extrapolate that to the rest of the year  or we cant extrapolate that to the rest of the year not yet we need a little bit more visibility as far as what is actually happening in the marketplace we do have a lot of launches this year but many of them are brand extensions and flankers and its going to be very difficult to compare with some of the major launches that we had last year jason gere and i understand that and i guess the question is in the first quarter what percentage of all new innovation came out in the first quarter versus the whole year so did we see  or  of all the new launches come out in the first or is it going to  i know you talked a little bit about coach in the third quarter and legend i think in the fourth quarter but i was just… russell greenberg jason the point that youre missing is the first quarter of  when you compare it to first quarter of  for us operations for example we did not have any sales of abercrombie and hollister in q of  all right and in q  in q  you have significant sales all right same thing with coach coach was launched in the second quarter  im sorry in the third quarter of  so for european operations you had zero sales of coach product in q of  thats what made the comparison so much easier for q and it makes it much more difficult for q q and q or as the year goes on jason gere thats fair okay so the sales side i get so then in terms from an eps and obviously the sales drives the leverage obviously we saw it in the first quarter are you still thinking about  or are you thinking about spending on ap maybe a little bit more on the digital side just wondering if you could kind of parcel out little bit some of the margin factors that kind of play into the eps guidance russell greenberg yes i think we said it at the end of the first quarter that on a fullyear basis we expect ap to be somewhere around  if you remember last year i thought it would be  we came in at  i think that  overall is probably a very reasonable number jason gere okay and then the other question anything just on the ecommerce side i know obviously in beauty there is a lot of talk about the us department stores and the good news is that you guys have  i think your exposure is probably less than many out there so can you maybe talk about how you guys are looking at alternative channels to maybe offset some of what i think are just headwinds for a lot of manufacturers who sell into the us department store channel jean madar russ you want to… russell greenberg yes i can yes of course the trend is always there that is less traffic in the us department stores and its somewhat being replaced by companies like ulta and sephora ecommerce is a very interesting market and i think weve talked about it briefly in the past this is something that we are very much looking into and looking to see how ecommerce can be used effectively within our organization that we do have some things that are planned but im not prepared really to go into too much detail on that at the present time but clearly i think that ecommerce is definitely something that is clearly the trend of the day if you will or the trend of at least this decade so wed be remiss if we werent looking into opportunities that could utilize social media and ecommerce jason gere okay i appreciate thanks for answering all my questions russell greenberg no problem jean madar thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from linda bolton weiser of da davidson please proceed with your question linda bolton weiser thanks hi so can you just comment on sort of the ma environment in the fragrance area coty has closed its deal with procter  gamble beauty and seems to be starting to accelerate maybe some of its portfolio review are you actively looking at potential deals and how are you thinking about your balance sheet cash i mean youve had the high cash balance for several years and sometimes new licenses dont require a cash upfront so how are you thinking about what you may do with that cash balance here now that its been kind of here for quite a few years jean madar im going to try to answer that so its public information that coty wants to divest some brands but i will not make any more comments on that we are always looking with the cash that we have in our balance sheet we are of course looking for acquiring names or licensing names so i will say that the ma environment is a little bit more open due to this coty proposed divestiture but we get offers we get offers from brands on  not on a daily basis but on a weekly or monthly basis and again in order to keep the portfolio very very strong we are very selective so we need to get  we are okay with a smaller brand if we see the potential we have the possibility to grow without increasing our ga so for us this is  we spend a lot and lot of time looking at possibility to grow like that russ you want to add something russell greenberg yes the only thing i would add is that linda youre a  correct many times on new licenses if there is not existing distribution then typically the upfront payments would be almost nothing but if you are looking to make an acquisition of an existing brand that has existing distribution that may  maybe it is with coty or some other licensee at the current time theyre based upon or depending on the size of the business the number of years remaining on the license it could require a sizeable upfront payment if you will we are still committed that we know that the most accreted use of our cash is if we can put it to use in buying opportunities that can add to our portfolio and we continue to search out and be opportunistic to the extent that we can as jean said that there was a lot of deals go ahead jean jean madar yes i would like to add that im very comfortable having  million or close to  million cash in the bank not because well be happy to have it and when we decide to make an acquisition for a large one for  million or even more so this will put us in a different category without any stress we are looking at medium size business but we could also integrate larger size business so thats why i think its very important keep this cash in our balance sheet linda bolton weiser okay and then… jean madar okay linda linda bolton weiser yes can i ask you about the jimmy choo i think jimmy choo is in the process of being sold does that represent any kind of a risk to your license agreement or does that carry through under the new potential… russell greenberg no our license agreement would continue if im not correct jean i think the license agreement goes through at least   jean madar yes so we have at least five more years with  in front of us jimmy choo is doing very well we have great relationship with the jimmy choo company we showed them that we are able to do well we started  this is a business which started from scratch weve been doing  can we disclose the number russ by brand russell greenberg yes jimmy we did  in  we did  million in jimmy choo sales jean madar so it will be above a  million business or its quite important the revenue from license from jimmy choo are quite important and the relationship is good so we expect to  no issues with the sale of  the potential sales of jimmy choo linda bolton weiser okay thank you very much russell greenberg thank you linda jean madar thank you thank you operator our next question comes from hamed khorsand of bws financial please proceed with your question hamed khorsand hi good morning so first off is there an update as to when coach would be released in japan jean madar this year for sure hamed khorsand okay is there a reason why you havent been able to releasing it yet jean madar it was a plan decision from the beginning so we do not see a  you know what coach is very important the brand is very important in japan but japan is not a huge market for fragrance but the us is the main market today and we are  we will be in most of the japanese partner stores this year hamed khorsand okay and then any plans to release more multiscents and really just take up on the trend of  with millennials as far as just buying smaller vials that have higher margin jean madar i dont think i got that can you repeat it please hamed khorsand yes so there is this growing trend with millennials as far as buying smaller vials multiscents with different scents of the brands so theyre being sold with higher margin markup so is there any plans on your end to release… jean madar we have collections  we do have collections like that in most of our programs its definitely a trend that we are participating into hamed khorsand okay all right and then as far as the gross margin outlook goes with eps just given where marketing is now i mean are you  the profits that you recorded this quarter i mean it sounds like youre just going to reinvest them at a higher rate just because this quarter was stronger i mean is that a good way to interpret it jean madar russ russell greenberg well in the first quarter if youre not dealing with a real  holiday type issues with respect to your advertising budget as you heard before we expect to spend somewhere around  for the full year here in the first quarter we spent  of sales and yet  and the sales represented what is it  something like  of our annual sales so clearly the bulk of our ad spending comes later in the year predominantly in the third quarter so its not a question of reinvesting the profits from the first quarter were constantly reinvesting money into the brands in the form of advertising i dont think anything has changed because of the results here on this particular first quarter hamed khorsand okay all right thank you russell greenberg thanks hamed jean madar thank you operator there are no further questions i would like to turn the call back over to mr russell greenberg for closing comments russell greenberg thank you again operator just one last point i will be presenting at the b riley investor conference on may  in santa monica and i will also be at the jefferies global consumer conference in

and webcast at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode a brief questionandanswer session will follow the formal presentation operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded i’d now like to turn the conference over to your host russell greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer for inter parfums please go ahead sir russell greenberg thank you good morning and welcome to our  yearend conference call as usual i will begin the call with a financial overview and then jean madar our chairman and ceo will discuss current business recent developments and upcoming plans after that we will take your questions before proceeding further i want to remind listeners that this conference call may contain forwardlooking statements which involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from projected results these factors include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading forwardlooking statements and risk factors in our annual report on form k and the reports we file from timetotime with the securities and exchange commission we do not intend to and undertake no duty to update the information discussed in addition regulation g codifications for the use of nongaap financial measures prescribes the conditions for use of nongaap financial information in public disclosures we believe that the presentation of the nongaap financial information included in this discussion is important supplemental measures of operating performance to investors the information required to be disclosed for the presentation of nongaap financial measures is disclosed in our december   annual report on form k which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission this information is available on our web site at wwwinterparfumsinccom when we refer to our europeanbased operations we are primarily talking about sales of prestige fragrance products conducted through our owned french subsidiary interparfums sa when we discuss our united statesbased operations we are primarily referring to the sales of prestige fragrance products conducted through our whollyowned domestic subsidiaries now moving on to comparable fourth quarter results net sales were  million up  from  million at comparable foreign currency exchange rates net sales increased  sales by europeanbased operations rose  to  million from  million and at comparable foreign currency exchange rates net sales increased  for united statesbased operations we generated net sales of  million up  from  million in the prior year gross margin was  of net sales as compared to  sga expense as a percentage of net sales was  compared to  operating income rose  to  million from  million net income attributable to inter parfums inc rose  to  million compared to  million and net income attributable to inter parfums inc per diluted share rose  to  from  thus full year net sales increased  to  million from  million in  at comparable currency exchange rates those net sales increased to  you will recall that our first quarter results included the effect of a pending settlement of a tax assessment with the french tax authorities of  million or  million net of noncontrolling interest thus in  net income attributable to inter parfums inc was  million or  per diluted share inclusive of the tax settlement and  million or  per diluted share exclusive of the tax settlement net income attributable to inter parfums inc in  was  million or  per diluted share we covered key sales drivers in our releases so i will focus on certain profitability factors as i just mentioned our consolidated gross margin for the  fourth quarter was  of net sales which looks a lot like the gross margin achieved in the first and second quarters as you may recall in the third quarter we shipped significantly more holiday giftsets and other promotional items which were sold at lower margins than regular merchandise which happened to have depressed gross margins for that third quarter but for the full year gross margin was  of net sales up from ’s  sga expenses increased  and represented  of net sales for the final quarter of  as compared to  in the fourth quarter of  for the full year sga expenses increased  as compared to  and as a percentage of sales sga expenses were  in  as compared to  in  the increase is primarily related to higher promotion and advertising expenses as planned we invested heavily in advertising and promotion to support new product launches as well as to build worldwide awareness for our portfolio brands in  promotion and advertising included in sga expenses aggregated  million or  of net sales and that’s up from  million or  of net sales in  there were two nonrecurring items that were included in our fourth quarter and full year operating results one that benefits and the other detracts from operating income in december we reached an agreement with the balmain brand calling for the buyout of the balmain license agreement effective december   in exchange for a payment of  million as a result we recognized a gain of  million in the fourth quarter payment is expected by the end of april and once our three month inventory selloff period terminates on march   balmain has agreed to purchase all remaining inventory and tangible assets the second item relates to the karl lagerfeld brand for which product sales had not met with our original expectations during the fourth quarter of  we decided that we will likely exercise our rights for an early termination of the karl lagerfeld license in  rather than continue the license through its original expiration in  as a result of this shortened expected life we recorded an impairment charge of  million for  and i am sure that john will talk more about our plans with respect to the karl lagerfeld license in his remarks moving on to our balance sheet we closed the year with working capital of  million including approximately  million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments our longterm debt including current maturities aggregated  million at december st jean please continue jean madar thank you russ and good morning everyone i am very pleased with our financial performance for  i would like to point out that with  fulltime employees worldwide inter parfums generated  million in sales in  which equates to almost  million in sales to employee which is quite an achievement i am also proud that we have grown our business in our two largest markets which are western europe where sales grew by  and north america where sales increased  over yearoveryear in asia our third largest market sales were  ahead of  and as i noted on our third quarter conference call korea and japan are making up some of the shortfall in china where the market remains depressed our next three markets are just about the same in size give or take a few million dollars central and south america the middle east and eastern europe and for the year as a whole our sales in eastern europe were down from last year owing to russia’s economic problems resulting from lower oil prices and a devalued currency before reporting on our  lineup i want to remind listeners that the  growth drivers for european operation were coming from montblanc rochas and coach brands and for us operation it was coming from hollister abercrombie and dunhill moving on to our launch schedule for  for montblanc we have the third legend pillar called legend night that will debut at the end of this year and roll out further in  you may have seen a large piece in women’s wear daily where our second legend flanker legend spirit was among the top five new fragrance launches in the us in  and our new coach signature fragrance for women also made the list we’ve got our first coach scent for men debuting in the fall of this year and we’re continuing the rollout of the coach signature scents both the eau de parfum primarily for the western market and eau de toilette geared for asia where the scent is unveiling in two major markets china and japan this year for jimmy choo we have two initiatives in the work one is an extension of a signature scents for women and the other is an extension for jimmy choo man for lanvin the international rollout of modern princess is continuing and we are preparing still another interpretation of eclat darpege our premier lanvin scent we’re also very excited about mademoiselle rochas our first new scent for the brand rochas which is initially debuting in  countries in the first half of  followed by further international geographic rollout in the second half of  for boucheron we have six scents collection coming to market and for van cleef we are adding a new juice to the collection extraordinaire line we also have some new ideas for the karl lagerfeld brand we will introduce two new fragrances men and women this year for karl lagerfeld at more democratic prices and we plan to reinvigorate this brand by changing the positioning and introducing this new jewel that i was talking about where they will be introduced during the summer moving on to the us operations abercrombie  fitch and hollister fragrances should continue to be growth catalysts in  as we have pointed out in international markets these names are viewed as american fashion brand so they are being sold in perfumeries beauty boutiques departmental and specialty stores and of course travel retail this month we have the women’s edition of abercrombie first instinct debuting exclusively at world duty free in the uk where it is doing extremely well from april next month the international rollout begins we also have a new dual launching internationally for hollister and dunhill well be launching desire extreme this year and oscar de la renta will have also a new fragrance for women called bella blanca that will be hitting the market later this year so as you can see we have a lot of launches in  and i was going to forget anna sui which will have also a new fragrance introduced in the third quarter of  so to summarize with our rich and diverse portfolio of brands we are not dependent on one or two for our growth or success we also recognize that all brands are not treated equal cutting ties with smaller brands can be the right move at the right time at the same time we are also on the lookout for additional brands to partner with or to license or to acquire we’ve got the balance sheet to make that happen our primary focus both in europe and us is on growing our high margin prestige fragrance business and that is also the focus of our acquisition strategy we have an effective efficient distribution network reaching  countries and in several of the most important markets we own or control the distribution organizations and of course we have a great talent and resource reservoir so now operator you can open the floor for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you at this time we’ll be conducting the questionanswersession operator instructions thank you our first question is from the line of linda bolton weiser with b riley please proceed with your questions linda bolton weiser you have quite a lineup of new launches for  can you just i don’t know if you said the timing of the two jimmy choo launches the man and the women what’s the timing of those jean madar jimmy choo so we are launching as we speak this quarter the extension of the women’s fragrance called jimmy choo loo and the men’s extension will be launched in the third quarter and if you’re talking about jimmy choo i can tell you that for the first two months of the year we are doing very well we are very opportunistic on our business of jimmy choo linda bolton weiser and then when you launched the montblanc legend spirit i guess that was in second half last  my expectation was that it was just a small flank of sort of thing but it ended up being pretty significant as a driver so is the montblanc legend night going to be on the scale of spirit or is it going to be like a more minor launch and then what’s the timing of that launch jean madar the legend will be launching really new pillar for legend with legend night we have been also surprised by the success of spirit so we expect also a nice growth in the montblanc in  russ do you want to add something russell greenberg the only thing that i would correct the legend spirit was actually launched in early  so we did have the product out for most of the year and as jean said its success caught everybody by a little bit by surprise it turned out to be a much more successful launch for a flanker than we expected linda bolton weiser and when does the legend night launch jean madar legend night will be launched in certain markets in third quarter russell greenberg it’s actually going to be towards the very end of the year in certain markets and then continue its geographic expansion into  linda bolton weiser and then can i just say a few in the russian market a lot of other small companies have been having difficulties getting on a more steady track of growth there given the market disruption are you selling in russia through distributors and is the issue that the distributors are having problems financing inventory or is it the end demand that has dried up in russia or is it both jean madar no we do not have too much an issue with our distributor because it happens to be that our distributor owns the  stores in russia and they own which represents  market share the name of the chain is called indiscernible so the problem is not really the distributor the problem is really the end consumers buying less prices are more expensive in rubles so we’ll have and that’s what we are doing for this year we’ll have to heavily spend in advertising to regain some market share and that’s what we will do with all our new launches for russia this year linda bolton weiser and then finally can i just ask you about the north american market and macy’s has had some store closures and department store traffic has been harmed in some ways due to less tourist foot traffic how is it that you’re succeeding so much and how is your distribution in the specialty like alta and sephora are you fully distributed there as well as in the department stores jean madar our business in department stores is following the trend it’s quite challenging but of course the business is at alta and sephora is growing at a very fast pace especially with alta more than sephora and we are lucky that the brands that we have are doing also well in department stores for instance we launched coach at macy and it was very successful so i will say that we are  even though the business in us department store is not great we have been okay this year but we are looking at this very carefully we do not want to be overdependent of a department store that’s why we will develop more programs for stores like alta russ you want to add russell greenberg no i think you hit it the two main issues is that the department store business is losing traction to those specialty stores we have our products hitting in both but it really is the success of the brands and the successes of the launches that is driving the results that we’ve been reporting operator the next question is from the line of joe altobello with raymond james please go ahead with your question joseph altobello first question i guess is more of a big picture one what went wrong with lagerfeld jean madar what went wrong with lagerfeld i think we misspositioned lagerfeld we wanted to recreate a product that was quite expensive geared for very key market where the brand today is we think more accessible and that’s why the new products that we’ll be launching are  lower in prices so it’s a more democratic a little bit or so more younger customer so we still think that we are going to find some growth in the business we just need to reposition and the adjustment the accounting adjustment that we have made is due to a test and we call it impairment test but it’s not a reflection of what we think of karl lagerfeld like i said these are brand that we’ll continue but we definitely need to reposition it and that’s what we are doing in order to find the growth for this year and next joseph altobello and in terms of china you guys talked about that market still being depressed if you hear from other beauty companies they talk about some fairly strong growth in china so i am just curious is this weakness unique to fragrances because most of the other beauty companies that we speak to are more make up skincare jean madar absolutely makeup and skincare is doing much better i see the orders coming back from china i see the program so i think that we see the light at the end of the tunnel for china but we are not going to see the growth that we’ve seen in the years in two years or four years before and china becomes an expensive market you need to advertise heavily and our business will grow at in  at a modest rate but we will see growth in china in  russ russell greenberg no i agree there i think the most important point that you made is that although we do see some very modest growth in china going forward its nowhere near the levels of growth that we have seen in years pass joseph altobello so the weakness is relegated to the fragrance category it sounds like jean madar yes and it is and that’s why we have spent in  we have just i think has increased a lot i think we spent close to  million in promotion and advertising in  because we need to increase the market share in difficult countries like china and like russia joseph altobello and just one last one for russ i guess if you look at your french subsidiary’s guidance which they gave back in january and again reiterated today they are looking for sales this year about € million to € million and i guess if you back into a us dollar number that implies some pretty massive growth for us business what’s going to drive that call it  growth in your domestic business russell greenberg well i’m not sure exactly what rates you’re using… joseph altobello dollar indiscernible to the euro… russell greenberg for the last two years the average was somewhere right around  so it’s very difficult to pinpoint i don’t think it means massive increases for the us but it certainly does mean reasonable or at least low doubledigits or high singledigit growth for the us side of the business and most of that is coming from the newest lines that we have which were launched last year the abercrombie and the hollister lines are what’s going to be driving this continued growth going into  in addition dunhill should have a little bit of an easier comparison but again i’m not  we’re not looking at massive growth here my model doesn’t show massive growth it shows in the high single digits operator our next question is from the line of frank camma with sidoti please go ahead with your question frank camma can you talk a little bit about just for kind of followup for the last question touched on a little bit about the promotion expense i mean absolute dollar and percentage going up but last year you have a number of new launches i understand you have a number of this year but is that same rate that we can expect going forward that level of support i mean do you  because you obviously that affects what kind of leverage you get on your sga so i just want to… jean madar yes russ you want to start russell greenberg i think it’s a trend that has been going on for the last several years we reached for our  included in our sga was around  of our sales was spent on promotion and advertising compared to  just a little under  the prior year as jean mentioned just two minutes ago with launching new product into countries like china or where the markets are relatively weak or even to support the brands in most of the major markets around the world we really have to support it with promotion and advertising and even though we see in our numbers  there’s also a significant amount of dollars that are spent by our distributors in local markets in connection with promotion and advertising this is part of our business this is the way we drive the business it’s the way brands grow and gain the name recognition that we need in order to keep these trends moving along so  is very reasonable i wouldn’t be shocked if it grew a little bit and went to almost  i think that’s the trend that we’re on at least over the last several years frank camma and have you found digital marketing at all effective in this category or is it… jean madar absolutely i will say last year between what we spent and what our distributor spent  of   at least of this budget was spent on digital and to go back to what russ said we think it’s very important to support our brands in order to continue to grow the market we could make more money if we were shortside we could be more profitable by cutting a point or two of advertising but it will be a very bad mistake we need to support all our brands coach is new and we are overspending much more than our obligation our contractual obligation on coach we are overspending much more than our average of  on oscar we are also overspending on jimmy choo and we want to continue like that and let’s not forget that we have to fight against larger company while on single source lot of new products so in order to be competitive we’ll continue the spending frank camma my last question is just on your infrastructure as a whole regardless of promotion but just as far as adding new brands i am assuming it’s still true that you wouldn’t have to really add much as far as incremental fixed cost if you were to bring on a new brand assuming is that correct jean madar absolutely i mean i don’t have numbers but we could add  million or  million of business with new license without changing anything in our sga russ you agree russell greenberg yes certainly without any significant changes absolutely jean madar significant changes yes operator operator instructions the next question is from the line of vahid khorsand with bws please go ahead with your question vahid khorsand could you provide an update as far as coach goes in japan and how much do you think at least the approach in japan would have on sales jean madar it’s a little bit early but i can tell you that we are overall budgeted and for japan we launched also in singapore which was quite good we’ll continue   is really the rollout of coach that coach besides being a very strong american brand in america is a very strong brand in asia so asia is a major major market for coach so we are  what i can tell you without disclosing the precise number is coach is over our target in all the countries that it has been notched and we will continue with the men’s line in august or september and we feel we will start shipping the men’s line in older markets so we’ll have even a stronger presence when we get to the christmas season vahid khorsand and then could you provide an update on rochas and other markets you could be going into jean madar we will be launching the new rochas in  countries next month definitely spain and france which are the two very important countries for rochas we’ll continue with the rest of europe belgium switzerland portugal then we will launch in the middle east saudi arabia dubai kuwait and of course south america argentina and brazil we’ll have a second wave towards julyaugust with the rest of the countries as you know rochas is not a license it’s a brand that we own so of course we do not have to pay royalty so we are spending we are able to put more money into advertising and i think that it will help the launch of a new fragrance vahid khorsand and going back to the conversation on the bigbox stores i know you were talking about your presence in specialty stores but have you done any internal research on how much of your sales come from the lowertiered malls and if you have any plans into combating that and when they eventually do shut down i mean where do you see the future of your sales coming from russell greenberg well i mean today the sales that you see in any bigbox stores is really coming through diversion for the most part other than if there are lines that are being closed out or discontinued you might find them but otherwise it comes through diversion and we take it very seriously this is a problem that has been in our industry as you know for many many years there are new techniques that we’re looking into with respect to inventory tracking and where it makes sense to do that from a monetary standpoint to protect some of our brands we’re going to do what we need to do to protect the brands but our business is not geared for bigbox stores or
