president welcome to the first edition of the faro d world corporate newsletter as we go forward with the renewal of faro we believe this will be an excellent way to communicate more effectively and deepen our d measurement partnership in  we have spoken publicly and often of our renewal efforts the term “renewal” can be interpreted in many ways so let me explain what i mean we continuously challenge ourselves to be a “forwardlooking” company rather than a status quo enterprise it has become increasingly clear that the way our generic d technology is used was quickly specializing  our renewal simply refers to the corporate reorganization required to focus our sales and product development along application lines rather than along productcentric lines that formed the foundation of

deliver his prepared remarks afterwards we will open the call for your questions new order bookings for first quarter  increased by  to  million from  million for first quarter  sales for first quarter  were  million an increase of  compared to  million for first quarter  excluding the unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately  million first quarter  sales would increase  compared to prior year our sales increase was primarily driven by an increase in product unit sales especially in construction bimcim and higher service revenue with new order bookings of  million and sales of  million our booktobill ratio was  for first quarter  product sales were  million for first quarter  an increase of  compared to  million for the prior year period reflecting strong unit sales growth in both new and pre owned products and construction bimcim segment sales partially offset by lower average selling prices mostly related to less favorable product model and geographical sales mix service revenue was  million for first quarter  a strong increase of  compared to  million for the prior year period this increase was primarily due to higher customer service revenue and continued increase in warranty revenue reflecting our focus sales initiative to increase aftermarket sales revenue in our factory metrology segment sales for first quarter  were  million an increase of  compared to  million for first quarter  this increase was mostly driven by higher customer service revenue and an increase in unit sales especially sales in demonstration and service inventory which generated a slight decline in average product selling price in our construction bimcim segment sales for first quarter  were  million an increase of  compared to  million for first quarter  primarily reflecting an increase in service revenue and higher unit sales particularly in our europe and asia pacific regions in our other segment sales for first quarter  were  million a decrease of  compared to  million for first quarter  sales and profitability of this segment may fluctuate quartertoquarter more than the other two segments as other segment includes our emerging verticals we are only in the initial stages of building a sales infrastructure and product offering to suit the need of these emerging verticals mainly product design public safety forensics and d solutions gross margin for first quarter  decreased to  from  for first quarter last year up  percentage points compared to prior quarter this yearoveryear decrease was related primarily to the production startup of new products and lower average selling prices reflecting higher sales of demonstration and service inventory as well as less favorable product model and geographical sales mix selling and marketing expenses were  million in first quarter  an increase of  compared to  million for first quarter  we made a strategic decision to expand our sales force aggressively to accelerate revenue growth as a percentage of sales selling and marketing expense increased to  for first quarter  compared to  for the prior year period general and administrative expenses for first quarter  were  million an increase of  compared to  million for the prior year period this increase was mostly driven by slightly higher compensation expenses and global system implementation cost to facilitate our harmonization initiatives however as a percentage of sales general and administrative expenses decreased to  for first quarter  compared to  for the prior year period research and development expenses were  million for first quarter  an increase of  compared to  million for first quarter  this increase was mostly related to engineering headcount additions from our  acquisitions and additional hires to support our new product drumbeat research and development expenses increased to  of sales for first quarter  compared to  of sales for the prior year period we reported a net loss of  million or  per share for first quarter  compared to net income of  million or  per diluted share for the prior year period turning now to working capital accounts receivable was  million at the end of first quarter  compared to  million at the end of first quarter  days sales outstanding were  days at the end of first quarter  down four days from the end of first quarter  total inventories were  million at the end of first quarter  compared to  million at the end of first quarter  mostly driven by an increase in raw materials for new product introductions offset by lower demonstration and service inventory at the end of first quarter  cash and shortterm investments totaled  million of which  million was held by foreign subsidiaries down only  million from year end our aggressive initiatives to grow the sales team inventory demands for new product introductions and rd expenses related to  acquisition were funded by cash flow from operations resulting in a neutral cash position relative to year end ill conclude with total headcounts at the end of first quarter  our total period ending headcount was  employees an increase of  compared to  employees at the end of first quarter  ill now hand the call over to simon simon raab good morning everyone over the past five quarter weve been executing an aggressive set of strategic initiatives to reposition faro to achieve its longterm financial objectives of delivering midteen sales growth strong gross margin of  or better and leveraging out cost base to achieve midteen operating margin the plan was designed with the three years effort and  was year one and constituted a restructuring year of globalization harmonization and upgrade of substantially every part of the business restructuring of the sales force around market verticals was intended to drive marketing sales product management and development to best serve the specific needs of the factory metrology construction public safety product design and d solutions verticals each of these verticals represents great potential for growth in d measurement we are gratified to see the sizable growth in construction in the first quarter of  and believe similar accelerated growth will also appear in the other emerging verticals as they are build out the growth is a direct result of verticals specific sales and product management efforts our orders growth of  in the first quarter provided an initial validation of our reorganization and our sales force expansion and process modernization strategy we believe this demonstrate that faro has a potential to achieve its midteen top line growth objectives with the right strategy sales force and products we anticipate the aggressive preinvestment and the expansion of the sales force and modernization effort will continue for at least two years at a greater than  rate to establish these new global verticals and continue our growth in a more established verticals in the first quarter our sales force headcount increased by  compared to prior year an increased our full time experience sales headcount a term which ill describe shortly by  the incremental feet on the street were a vital ingredient to deliver this quarters strong orders growth while the companys increase in salary expenses negatively impacted operating income we preinvested these selling expenses always under the aggressive way to reset our business model to greater revenue to expense ratio by stabilizing expense growth with the intention of achieving double digit operating margins by  over the longer term we would anticipate our sales hiring into transition back to a normalized goal of  to  per year to stabilize the expansion of sales and marketing expenses sales efficiencies are also expected to increase to the sale modernization initiatives weve discussed in previous calls in order to sustain the double digit revenue growth rate we aspire to during last quarters earnings call we explained that the sales headcount represents a key business metric for our vertical leaders we track sales headcount from two perspectives actual period ending headcount and a time when time weighted average experienced headcount which we refer to as fte or full time experienced headcount for sales fte headcount we discount the first year of inventory by an experience factor we are continually monitoring the first year sales productivity of our sales force to gain a better understanding how the full time experienced headcount discount factor shifts from vertical and region and over time at the end of the first quarter  the actual period ending sales headcount is  an increase of  compared to  for the first quarter of  at the end of the first quarter  our sales fte headcount was  an increase of  compared to  in the same prior year period during last quarters earnings call we referenced the sales revenue effectiveness factor that we defined as the ratio of our trailing  months of sales revenue with sales fte headcount for full year  these sales affecting this factor equated to approximately  of sales revenue per fte as we continue to develop our effectiveness to actively manage our growing sales force we are shifting our focus and discussion to new sales orders revenue and sales revenue as the booktobill fluctuate as sales accelerated we believe that the sales order growth is more immediately correlated with sales force expansion and performance hence the sales effectiveness factors to find out the ratio of the quarters annualized sales orders for sales fte headcount based on the quarters historical proportion of a full year for the first quarter  we saw increase in our sales per fte to approximately  compared to up  in the fourth quarter  we would caution however that there maybe a seasonal effect of order per fte and for purposes of planning we continue to use the historically validated annual figure of  per fte well review the sales per fte quarterly we continue to look for ways to increase our sales per fte through the online demonstration studios our new product drumbeat and other initiatives our intention to increase sales fte headcount by at least  in  while keeping all other headcount substantially flat except where require to meet customer demand well report quarterly on the actual period ending headcount and sales fte headcount as part of this complete restructuring our research and development organization was reorganized to be able to provide the vertical product specificity and new product cadence required to growth this new emerging verticals the success of our business starts with the efficiency execution of our research and development team of next generation technical superior product on a consistent timeline since the start of  weve introduced  new or upgraded hardware and software solutions to the market over the past two quarters our new product drumbeat introduced the next generation releases of two primary platform products in fourth quarter  we introduced our eight generation of the market leading focus laser scanner product line to drive new orders and sales growth primarily in our construction bimcim and public safety forensics vertical this eight generation laser scanner was engineered to be better suited to our customers application with many new features superiors to be and accuracy along with an advanced ite readiness rating in january we also introduced our next generation of vantage laser tracker product line which is now fully portable and includes the latest version of our proprietary track on product for large volume and measurement very significant product introductions territory different verticals will continue this year we expect our ma strategy and cadence will continue in  to compliment this rd strategy by adding new product and technologies to support our growth as with in the various vertical significant rd and product management effort is being spent and leverage these small acquisitions through our growing global channel rd and ma is also focused on mitigating several potential future technology risks by ensuring that faro is controlled over essential underlying technologies important to future supply further to this strategy on april  we completed the acquisition of nutfield technology a component technology business in hudson new hampshire which specializes in the design and manufacture of advanced galvanometer based optical scanners scan heads and laser kit our first quarter operating margin maybe below the expectations of our analysts or investors we made this strategic decision to act now to aggressively expand our sales force and development of these new products recognizing that there maybe a shortterm impact to our financial results we are often asked about private cash holding and apart from the obvious use of cash and ma review the operational use of cash to finance our aggressive return to grow company status and expand into new market as an obvious corporate advantage of our cash holding which will necessarily depress operating margin in the short term the aggressive early introduction of new major revisions of our core platform is mainly to focus laser scanner and vantage laser tracker challenge the organization and resulted in efficiencies which are seen as shortterm reduction in gross margin new approaches to new product development process these are being developed to mitigate product risk in the future and adapt to our new cadence of product introduction and improvement our goal is still to continue the reorganization activities by the end of the current quarter within our  months previously stated timeline the primary remain reorganization for priorities in the second quarter will be to continue to expand the sale force as well as drive global process harmonization and manufacturing efficiencies to best practice in summary we are delighted with our reorganization progress as we ended this central global effort this quarter we will then turn our fullest attention to driving revenue improving gross margin and achieving double digit operating margin by  finally id like to thank all our faro employees for the tremendous hard work and dedication over the past five quarters and reinvigorating the growth of this company ill now open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and well take our first question from jim ricchiuti with needham  company please go ahead jim ricchiuti hi thanks good morning so i think we  i recognize the investment that you have going on in the business particularly in the sales side but if we just look at the sequential change in revenues from q to q and i think you are down about  million but up quite a bit opex i think about  so i am trying to get a sense as to how we might think about opex over the next one to two quarters bob i dont know if you could help us a little bit with that bob seidel as simon indicated our goal in terms of our operating expenses being rd and ga is to hold the headcount where it is manage the headcount tightly so in terms of where opex is going it should be relatively consistent over the next three quarter in terms of ga and rd on the selling side we are preinvesting in our sales force you saw what simon indicated was we will be growing our sales force upwards of  this year so youll see an uptick in our selling and marketing cost throughout the year both from the perspective of added headcount and then as our sales grow so will our commission what you can expect to see in terms of incremental headcount cost would be call it about  base  to  commission going forward on those incremental heads jim ricchiuti simon youve talked about this three year plan and you being in year two youve also talked about june having by the end of q i think having the platform in place so help us maybe with what type of milestones we should be looking for both in the second half of this year and just  and potentially just the year as a whole in terms of the strategy that you’ve laid out simon raab so i have mentioned we could start to see important increases in gross margin our hope is while we have q of periodoverperiod double digit growth indiscernible we should be looking for the same thing in q over q of last year i understand your sequential comment of obviously that because of a seasonality i am not sure thats relevant but qoverq the growth should continue at the high double digit commensurate with the sales per fte and the increase in the headcount so increase in gross margins and it should start to be thinning ph clearly introduction of another few major revisions of core products will be expected as well with introduction of product lines that came out of the prior acquisitions as we now converted them over to faro standards and introduce them into our full production line you should also see i believe an increase in the sales per fte if in fact our sales modernization effort improved now you saw a number change from about  to about  or  per fte and thats an important change it may represent important changes in our sales process but we want to give it a couple more quarters to actually decide whether that the real effect or not rather than a seasonal effect so you should also be looking for that ga will continue to drop as a percentage of the sale and as bob mentioned the rd will remain basically headcount flat except as it relates to potential acquisition in its space ph those will be outside of the current model jim ricchiuti last question just with respect to the new product efforts should that be skewed more towards the second half of this year in terms of new product introductions simon raab yes we have  well we have maybe ill call the three core platform which is indiscernible technology the laser tracker and scanner market the other ones are growing and catching up weve already done a major platform conversion of the two of those platforms and we would expect to continue that in other core platforms as well so i think thats the only answer i can give on that question operator and well take our next question from richard eastman with robert w baird please go ahead richard eastman yes good morning simon and bob could you just kind of reference  you made enough indiscernible references bob and i think simon you did as well but you just talked a little bit about the geographic sales mix influencing the gross margin and i am curious if you could shed little bit a color on that and also if the gross margin and i presume this is mostly on the product side if the gross margin by geography has there been any change in what each of the geographies is delivering in other words either competitive or pricing can you just speak to the geographic mix here bob seidel sure in terms of sales growth yearoveryear europe and asia indiscernible they got very similar yearoveryear sales growth our north america business was relatively flat so how does that impact our gross margin generally speaking our north america is a strong margin area for us in factory and metrology there is the automotive sector space sector there so that being flat certainly creates an unfavorable geographical mix the second place of reference to geographical mix was we really saw a flat japan sales yearoveryear japan is a price  a very good margin country for us so thats for us the other area in terms of product mix what i also mentioned is we did release some more aggressive value priced products vantage tracker the eam ph those products certainly while they are there to get market share for us they are there to expand the technology they also put some pressure on the margin but really rich the main primary driver of margin was the startup of two core platform products in our production process richard eastman okay all right and then also just perhaps you could maybe shed a little bit more light on this demo inventory issue weve seen this for a number of quarters and i think one of the things that’s probably  its difficult to see that on the balance sheet the demo inventory doesnt look like its changed much and i am curious how is it that this inventory is kind of aging we are shipping selling it but we are not seeing any real reduction in the demo inventory numbers on the balance sheet so just kind of explain that dynamic a little bit bob seidel yes in terms of the demo inventory one year ago q  we were  million our demo and service we are  million so we have in total reduced that number and so what we are actively trying to do is sell those what we call at risk or older items so we call three years are older right now we have in terms of the at risk inventory we are trying to reduce that actively there is about  million remain for us thats where the lowest margins come from once we go forward from there well continue to have their new product drumbeat after continue to sell so well be complete part of our business in as we said in our press release the new sales accounting for  of our total product sales this quarter so it will be continue part of our process the only thing id say different rich is it will be newer units that we will be selling richard eastman okay great thank you and then just  simon raab rich sorry to interrupt i wanted to just add one nuance to bobs response on the  it was really a mix  the margin was affected by geographical mix primarily by the shipments not by the orders actually orders in americas were up about  it was not flat so its the  it just happened to be the dynamic of the quarter of where we did the shipping to which was primarily the europe and the far east i just dont want you to be left with the impression that there was no growth in the americas there was a  growth richard eastman in orders i understand okay and then just the last question in terms of the other segment here with the businesses that are maybe a little bit more in their infancy how do we expect that those businesses to scale from a profit standpoint do we absorb increased losses there as we move forward or will the profit line scale with sales because it sounds like we have more investment to make there and i am just curious how that relationship will look going forward in other segments simon raab so rich those emerging actually only verticals are viewed from upper end margin contribution point of view where we include the gross margin and the salary expenses and product management expenses and marketing expenses related to simply to that vertical so there is a positive contribution magnitude to those verticals we expect that to be diminished at the beginning while we accelerate the sales hiring but they contribute pretty quickly and they are not a drag they are not as greater contribution as the other more established player they will contribute quite quickly operator and we will take our next question from patrick newton with stifel please go ahead james rit marker hi simon and bob its james rit marker on for patrick just curious as to what drives the increase in your fte headcount guidance i believe last quarter you said  to  now we are raising that up to  just want to know if there is anything specific thats causing you to increase that and then also as we think about these recent headcount additions gaining experiencing over the year and adding to the fte metric would it be fair to assume that in terms of absolute headcount growth we wont see anything greater than the  yearoveryear that you just posted simon raab so your first question is why do we apparently change our tact  we decided as we noted in our prepared comments that we decided to accelerate the growth of the fte headcount we started getting very positive indicators that the correlations sales growth was as exclusive as we had suspected and that the sales per fte headcount were a number which have regular consistency in the past to the company and then we had a lot of under penetrated market in new emerging verticals so we decided that we would want to create a new balance between the revenue side and expense side of the companys current structure by accelerating the headcount and resetting the amount of revenues versus our  what we try to fix is our expenses in rd and ga as well as depreciation so we made the conservative decision to accelerate that we would not be exceeding the  we are shooting for  however i have to say that we always retain the freedom to  if we see positive results and increases in the margin and the bifurcation between revenues and expenses which goes to operating margin that we remain satisfied to continue to accelerate even further obviously we will review that quarterly and make those decisions appropriately your last question on the  obviously  yes i think i answered that thanks operator and we will take our next question from jordan mark with noble capital markets please go ahead mark jordan yes good morning question relative to the service revenue obviously very strong quarter there is that level of  plus millions sustainable through the year andor do you believe that there is a growth rate that you should expect to see of this space over time simon raab i think the right answer to that question is that since the primary component of those revenues and the increase in revenues is the sales of the warranties and extended warranties to established and installed base so one would expect that if one can get high double digit growth rates in the installed base to sales and product saving the subsequent year after the first year of build in warranty that we have the opportunity to substantially increase sales of warranties to that increasing installed base so i believe properly executed that that should accelerate along with the installed base mark jordan okay question with regards to your cash position as you pointed out you do have  some odd million outside of the united states what can you do to deploy that successfully  because obviously i dont think you are bringing back to the us because of the tax burden that you would face simon raab well you know there are two uses of the cash there is two uses of the cash primarily ma and of course working capital our installed fte headcount around the world is smaller apac and in emea so we see a long investment to expand those emerging verticals in those regions and we continue to be interested and have initiatives underway to look at ma potentials in other parts of the world as you know last year we also did an acquisition in germany and we are looking elsewhere as well so part of the deployment of that cash will be to focus our efforts on looking at ma targets in those regions and use of working capital to kind of fill up the locations for sales and service around the world outside of the americas to bring it to better balance versus gdp around the world mark jordan okay final question for me just would be to go back towards the demo inventory you talked about monitoring what you call the at risk component which is the old product typically greater than three years old how do you manage the turn over of that demo inventory on a quarterly basis so that you minimize the amount of product that drifts down into that at risk category bob seidel so we have a process that we follow between our chief commercial officer joe arezone our chief operating officer kathleen hall they constantly monitor this we look at unit by unit and then we look for opportunity to sell that at best possible price around our global sales network this is an active piece that we manage and as we go forward with our new product drumbeat we like to continue to manage that process as well operator and well take our next question from bobby burleson with canaccord please go ahead john dicorsi hi guys this is john dicorsi on for bobby so just two questions first revisit your opex comment would the expectation for rd to be flat in terms of headcount this year would you still be expecting the total dollar spend to be down yearoveryear as you mentioned in the last quarter simon raab well it is a good piece of the rd which is obviously expenditure on development and materials related to development so we are continually aggressively development process and we do intend to come out with many new products which are under development as we speak so the reorganization of the rd was to make that department more efficient and generate more products suited to the different verticals so there was an internal reorganization but i would expect material costs to go up relating to the efforts of generate significant new product introductions in the other vertical so it would be a bit of mixed bag in addition to that we have a habit of purchasing a small type bolton type of company that we can then process new technologies through channel and lot of those come in with rd and or primarily rd and development stuff so there could be  and i did mention in my remarks that part of our effort to keep our organic component flat there will be additions through the ma drumbeat that we are continuing bob seidel and you work it out from  million to the  million yearoveryear is primarily the acquisitions john dicorsi okay and then my second question is just on the new products that came out in  can you just give any color on the reception to date by customers which were kind of the leading products i know it sound  some of their gross margin hit was new products that were value oriented but just any additional color on what the reception has been would be great simon raab well the increase in the construction bimcim market reflects the very significant uptick of the new v scanner it continues to be market leading all the various market surveys indicated that its still the leading product in that market its new improvements substantially move it beyond the competition the new introduction of vantage tracker its a little early to make any statements about it but it represents a leading class portable performance that has not been seen in that market sector along with the track on concept its a little bit early to see the benefit we have an uptick in imagery which is a technology leading product which is benefiting from the d solutions vertical so its a little bit early to say but id say the biggest indicator is the scanner so far operator and well take our next question from hendi susanto with gabelli  company please go ahead hendi susanto good morning simon and bob how should we view your aggressive sales force and sales and marketing initiatives along your major vertical and geographies which verticals and geography carry the most promising sales leverage when you increase your sales headcount simon raab well clearly our in balance of about  of our sales in the us and  odd in the other two regions demand that  while there are still even gdps between those regions are approximately even gdps between those regions we feel that we need to expand primarily in the emea and apac regions while still also supporting significant increases here there has tendency for the fte deeper headcount to be lower in the apac regions and some of that has to do with competitive pricing issues and others issues around the apac region but the balance is a moving target and as we introduce new products and new categories that suit different market you are going to be seeing that affect geographically in a different way so we are just going to report on a regular basis and it is being measured hendi susanto and how about among verticals simon raab well among the verticals clearly the emerging verticals are demanding the greatest increase in our staffing now we want to be careful about that because we also have  you dont have a fairly developed product line in some of those verticals like product design for example has only a couple of products in while we would like to add and we are on the process of working on several others that add to it so we dont want to get the headcount too far ahead of the product availability so that they can sustain the typical sales per fte that we would like public safety forensics benefits tremendously from our product so we  from our current product line so we believe that we can aggressive grow that resale scan arms forensic scan arms and resell scanners into that market which are to primary co products that are market leading so we see a greater increase in the headcount in public safety forensics as an emerging one so we are trying to strike balance between keeping our growth in construction in bimcim and metrology market while giving attention to these emerging verticals we dont want fall into trap of feeding the ones that have always been our primary producers in the past and we are trying to level load all the verticals over the next three years hendi susanto and then a question for bob looking at construction building information they had  yearoveryear growth in q so it is  it has like a very strong growth any seasonality factor that we should keep in mind when we look into that segment bob seidel no the growth in that area was predominately driven by higher unit sales which are in correlation with the release of our new focus s so standard is always seasonal we follow the same pretty much seasonal pattern as the rest of our business q being highest hendi susanto and then simon in  you talked about faros strategic interest in factory automation do you have any update on that and whether it will on your product roadmap in  simon raab yes absolutely we are in the process of working our major agreements with important worldwide robotic manufactures we are in the process of continuing developing sensors for the automated metrology market and its kind of very big focus you will have  and we have introduced the robo image or mobile last year in ea product as an early adopter product that will be converted to mainline product this year d solutions is a new vertical which is having some very great early success and that is entirely around automation with contracts for robotic installation  robotic inspection installation around the world so we are very focused on that on two perspectives the d solutions vertical will be primarily around on automated inspection and our rd around sensors and important d measuring devices specifically for that market as the other part of that mission operator and we will take our next question from ben rose with battle road research please go ahead ben rose good morning just another question on the nice yearoveryear growth in the construction bimcim market simon realizes that the new product introduction is a play but you see a cyclical recovery in that market some of the end user segments in that market and to what extent are your appetite for adding additional sales headcount kind of confidence that that market is kind of coming back to life simon raab well i think we should separate whats going on at the macro and economic level and construction from whats happening for faro and ill explain that first of all we are extremely under penetrated with  almost no penetration of that market and its a very new market and so really what happened at a macro economic level i dont believe that that should have an impact on whats going on for us ill say however that there is a revolution going on in construction and that is related to the use of d measurement as part of the management of as build and in the construction process in the renovation process post construction and so on and so forth everybody is realizing that the significant savings that were made through metrology and manufacturing to reduce scrap and rework has the exact same potentials for savings in the construction business so if we have seen anything it is that there is deep deep interest for the implementation of d measurement technology in the construction industry irrespective of the downturn and as it turns out in the past when we had downturns in macroeconomic level people are more interested in getting low cost adaptable and portable measurable equipment into the manufacturing environment to squeeze out profit in those contexts so upside or downside in the construction industry they benefit tremendously from this technology so we will continue to invest aggressively in the headcount growth around the world irrespective of what the macroeconomic of construction are doing for those regions operator and we have no further questions at this time simon raab okay well then ill close the call thank you everybody for your interest today and we look
