and short investments primarily in publicly traded equity securities in the global utility sector including but not limited to electric gas and water utilities and independent power companies utility service and fuel providers utility equipment manufacturers including but not limited to renewable and energy technology companies and related sectors the investment manager believes that the funds investment objective can be achieved by fundamental analysis and risk management in order to source attractive investment opportunities in the global utility sector through bottomup fundamental analysis the investment manager attempts to uncover both undervalued and overvalued securities and eventdriven special situations the investment manager aims to position the funds portfolio accordingly to capitalize on such analysis in addition this bottomup analysis benefits from a topdown analysis of both industry variables eg market structure changes legislative and regulatory changes commodity prices etc and macroeconomic variables eg interest rates foreign exchange rates country risks etc the investment manager anticipates using amounts of leverage which will vary from time to time in order to maximize the funds returns the investment manager also seeks to diversify the funds holdings although it anticipates maintaining a substantial portion of the funds holdings in
