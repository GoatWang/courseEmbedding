tech at new highs and the nasdaq up  in a row can it keep going posted by lplresearch after a rough june technology has come roaring back with the sp  information technology index finally clearing its march  peak and the techheavy nasdaq composite index up  days in a row for the first time since early  the obvious question is can this potentially continue we think so first things first it took the sp  information technology index  days to clear its march   closing high but it finally did on wednesday july  here’s the catch per ryan detrick senior market strategist “some might think because tech is at new highs this means we are in a bubble but we would disagree tech is  away from a real high if you factor in inflation meaning there still could be plenty of room to run not to mention earnings are strong and valuations are still modest a recipe for higher longerterm prices in our book” tech has been strong recently but on a longerterm basis relative to the sp  index it took years to get over the tech bubble hangover as the chart below shows tech isn’t as extended as it might seem and could continue to be a major driver of equity gains last yesterday july  the nasdaq closed in the green for the tenth day in a row this is significant as history would suggest nearterm strength could continue in fact since  the nasdaq has gained  on average during the month following a day win streak versus an average monthly return of  looking at this same period three months later things became more normal over the next several weeks though the bulls could still be in charge important

sharetwitterfacebooklinkedinemailprint move index and treasury yields – correlation but likely no causation posted by lplresearch the merrill lynch option volatility estimate index move is the bond market’s equivalent of the chicago board of options exchange volatility index vix and helps to gauge the current level of fear or complacency in fixed income markets since launching in april  the index has averaged a reading of approximately  but it has averaged just  over the last five years on july   it dipped below  for the first time since may   in fact the index has shown a reading of less than  just  days in its nearly year history so what can very low bond market volatility tell us about the future direction of interest rates the answer is disappointingly little there appears to be correlation with large moves in year treasury yields when the move is at extreme levels however a closer look at history leads us to believe this correlation does not imply causation as the below table shows all of the index readings below  occurred between late april and early may  the bond market may have been complacent at the time however the driver of higher yields was former federal reserve fed chairman ben bernanke’s comments about tapering fed bond purchases which led to the period’s aptly named “taper tantrum” although bond market complacency at the time may have exacerbated upward moves in rates it certainly did not cause them conversely very high move readings above  occurred between late september and december  during a period of extreme equity market volatility and weakness year treasury yields tumbled  in the fourth quarter as equity market turbulence led investors to flee riskier assets and allocate to perceived safehavens such as us treasuries the high readings in the move a high level of fear in the bond markets therefore seemed to be a symptom of the same problem that led to the drawdown in yields but not the cause of them while the move index may well gauge current sentiment in the markets its predictive power in the direction and severity of yield moves appears lacking important disclosures the economic forecasts set forth in the presentation

volatility implied in the prices of options contracts for the sp  it is a marketbased estimate of future volatility when sentiment reaches one extreme or the other the market typically reverses course
