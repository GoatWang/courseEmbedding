online payment services provider vogogo a platform that automates payment processing regulatory compliance and risk management for businesses including clients in the bitcoin and digital currency sector has raised m in new funding the round was led by cormark securities inc and included beacon securities limited canaccord genuity corp clarus securities and salmon partners with the capital aimed at helping the company expand its service beyond canada to the us and europe speaking to coindesk vogogo cso rodney thompson said that his firm has become more actively involved in the digital currency space owing to the need of the industrys businesses for a partner that can handle fiat compliance and the associated fraud mitigation responsibilities that coincide with these offerings thompson told coindesk that most of his firms partners are digital currency exchanges that have turned to vogogo to handle their risk management know your customer kyc antimoney laundering aml fraud mitigation and dispute resolution needs explaining our banking partners are willing to work with us so we can put our payment processing behind that its been proven that the digital currency industry is trying to put its best foot forward but people are having a difficult time with managing the platform side of it thompson indicates that vogogo has become a valuable thirdparty partner that allows digital currency businesses to mitigate fraud in real time without having to build inhouse systems that meet this need now thompson indicated his firm is looking to build on this success to perform similar services to digital currency companies operating outside of canada adding for us its just about growth taking what weve been doing in canada and expanding out globally from our side were specializing this piece of what we do for the crypto industry for crypto businesses early market entrance thompson indicated that though vogogo and its employees have had an internal interest in bitcoin for some time as the companys cto was an early and active bitcoin miner despite the familiarity it wasnt until the june  closure of libertybit then the secondlargest exchange in canada that the company became convinced it could serve a real business need in the budding industry thompson recalls libertybit really stands out to me because they were ran into a problem where they were doing online bank maintenance and they thought they were indemnified and of course there really is no such thing as an indemnified payment and they went down so it was then that you were just starting to see the issues around it this development as well as similar shutdowns from other major exchanges pushed vogogo to look more closely at the opportunity after about three months of development vogogo tailored its offering to the digital currency space and began serving the market how vogogo works thompson revealed vogogo is currently working on a new product release that will allow it to handle kyc aml and compliance requirements for digital currency exchanges we will do the ongoing fraud mitigation so we will set the customer with their payment and all the ongoing fraud mitigation around it thompson said what that means is well manage all your bad debt any fraud scenarios that happen we manage all that vogogo doesnt actually handle bitcoins or altcoins for its clients instead vogogo ensures that fiat payments are managed correctly limiting its clients risk for chargebacks and the other previously mentioned issues that come with the responsibility for customer funds thompson added when an end user gets to that exchange to deal in bitcoin or altcoin thats on the exchange when they want to take whatever theyve sold and move the fiat back into the currency of their choice thats also on the exchange no pivot needed thompson said that while vogogo is happy to serve clients in the digital currency space extending its services to this community doesnt necessitate a fundamental change in its business vogogo had historically served ecommerce platforms and continues to do so rather thompson indicated that all vogogo needed to do was gear its existing offerings to the needs of the space while capitalizing on existing expertise he continued weve always dealt in secondary payment options and that being payments that arent credit card related and because of that weve always had a risk engine in front of those payments when asked about potential upcoming digital currency regulation in canada the cso said that this too wont require vogogo to shift or change its product offering for us we have a really strong payments team we have a really strong risk management team legal team so were constantly adapting what we do on the shifts regulatory or other if there is a change on the regulatory side that we need to address its pretty easy for us to make those changes and to make our platforms compliant expanding to new markets as for the funding thompson indicated that it will be necessary given the companys desire to enter new markets in europe and north america especially owing to the expense of expanding a risk platform globally this expansion thompson said will require vogogos payment solutions to be customized and integrated with domestic banks thompson concluded we take working with our banking partners and any regulatory requirements very seriously we dont cut any corners if were set up to be somewhere its all set up properly for more information on vogogo and its payment solutions visit the companys website images via vogogo the leader in
