reputed to contain all sorts of bizarre clauses to ensure that neither was out of pocket if the dream turned sour they were mocked for for being overcautious and unromantic but according to new re search people outside the celebrity bubble would do well to take a leaf out of their book if they want to avoid serious disputes after tying the knot how couples organise their household finances is increasingly complicated and more people than ever are choosing to keep their finances separate after moving in together in an attempt to hang on to some financial autonomy according to new research from alliance and leicester a third of cohabiting and married couples keep individual bank accounts women in particular are wary of giving up their hardwon financial independence the research found some  of women and  of men confess to keeping a bank account in their own name there also appears to be a lack of trust when it comes to who takes responsibility for managing the household finances with large numbers of both men and women reluctant to hand over their financial affairs to their partner in case they mess it up men are the least likely to trust their partner with the finances but of women who hung on to separate bank accounts  said they held on to some independence because they thought their partners were bad with money ewan edwards head of current accounts at alliance  leicester says separate bank accounts and financial inde pendence remain important to people even after they tie the knot  but it seems women are far more concerned about being financially independent than men even though men are more worried about their partners mismanaging the joint finances however statistics often hide more complex arrangements in some cases couples may have totally separate finances while a popular compromise option may be to have a joint account for bills and individual accounts for other expenditure research last year by the fawcett society which campaigns for womens rights found that in many cases men and women continue to have differing views about how household finances should be handled and who should assume responsibility when jobs  money surveyed young married couples this week we found a pattern emerging of couples very often starting out with totally separate financial arrangements only to set up some sort of joint financial arrangement as their circumstances changed in one instance a young couple from london decided to change their arrangements after taking on a mortgage and having children it just seemed too complicated to divide so many shared expenses mrs evans says however she admits a joint account causes no end of rows another couple we spoke to used just one account for family and business matters at first but problems arose when each partner wanted to spend money on themselves i do think we had more control over our expenditure when the accounts were separate says mrs moore we both took responsibility for keeping our accounts in order and they were more easily managed but whether a couple has separate accounts or bundles everything in together the main issue according to some experts is whether they are upfront about how they want things to work right from the start independent financial advisor donna bradshaw of fiona price and partners says some people will want to keep managing their own finances especially with people marrying later and being used to looking after their own money the key is to be very open she says not talking about money in advance is often the kiss of death for a relationship a plan that works  no argument graham neilson and his girlfriend kristina bruce bought a house and moved in together in january last year and as far as managing household finances go they are typical of many in the younger generation the couple from falkirk in scotland say they had no difficulty setting up a system for managing household finances that suited them and because it works they have so far avoided any awkward arguments about money we thought it was the natural thing to do keeping our own accounts mr neilson a yearold telesales executive says i think younger people want to keep things separate because its what they are used to younger people are much more careerminded and want to look after their own affairs like thousands of people living together the couple run a joint account plus individual accounts they also have separate occupational pensions which they think draws a clear line this system works well for them he says  touch wood topics family finances

by cindy hill custodial and guardian accounts are two ways of managing money for someone else comstock imagescomstockgetty images related articles what is a bank trust account how to terminate a family trust account how to set up a joint revocable trust guardian accounts and custodial accounts are two forms of financial accounts in which one personthe guardian or custodianmanages the account funds for the benefit of another person guardian accounts must start with formal court action naming a legal guardian who then manages the money for the benefit of someone known as the ward custodial accounts are typically opened by parents on behalf of their children although there are other types of custodial accounts as well divorce is never easy but we can help learn more custodial accounts a custodial account is a bank or other financial account that a person opens for the benefit of another person called the beneficiary the person who opens the account is often the custodian  the person who manages the account  although its also possible to name a third party as custodian the money in the bank account is legally the property of the beneficiary and the custodian has a fiduciary duty to manage the funds in the beneficiarys interest utma and coverdell accounts two common types of custodial accounts allow parents or other family members to manage money on behalf of children uniform transfers to minors act accounts  known as uniform gifts to minors act accounts in some states  allow relatives to open custodial savings accounts for minor children the money within the account belongs to the child and any interest earned by the account is income to the child and taxed at his or her income tax level although the parent or other custodian can add and withdraw funds at will he or she has a fiduciary responsibility to manage the funds in the childs interest the custodian is relieved of his duties when the beneficiary turns  a coverdell education savings account is a custodial account which may be opened for any child under  and which has distinct tax advantages although restrictions apply on the amount of money that can be deposited interest on these accounts remains taxfree if the money is used before the child is  for qualifying educational purposes other types of custodial accounts custodial accounts are often used in business situations where funds are being held in escrow or accumulated to be paid to another party mortgage companies usually require the homeowner to set up a custodial account into which funds are deposited for the mortgage payment and to escrow for property taxes homeowners insurance and other expenses guardianships a guardian is a person formally appointed by a court to be legally responsible for another individual referred to as a ward a court may appoint a guardian for a child or an adult with disabilities who cannot manage his or her own affairs guardianships can be temporary or permanent and may be limited to management of certain aspects of the wards life such as her medical care or finances the guardian must gather the wards assets together and place any financial assets into distinct accounts that are not held jointly with any other person guardian bank accounts must be clearly titled as being held by the guardian for the ward court oversight custodial accounts are not generally subject to court review unless a beneficiary sues for breach of fiduciary duty since guardians are appointed by a court to protect the ward from potential exploitation courts require guardians to submit an accounting usually annually detailing how the wards funds have been invested or spent any large purchases or nonnecessary expenditures usually must be approved by a court ahead of time guardians are required to make the wards assets last as long as possible and are also responsible for filing tax returns for the ward divorce is never easy but we can help learn more references new york state courts justice institute

is variable life insurance and how does it work variable life insurance is intended to provide two important benefits o a death benefit that is not taxable to your beneficiary and o a cash value that can grow with taxes on the growth being deferred you allocate your net premium payments the amount that remains after we deduct premium charges from the premiums you pay and cash value among the variable investment options and the fixedrate option most of these options provide variable returns thats why its called variable life insurance under a variable universal life insurance policy you are also able to change o the death benefit option o your policys face amount and o the frequency and amounts of payments if the investment options that you choose perform well the cash value of your policy will increase and the death benefit may also increase as a variable life insurance policyowner however you bear the risk of investment losses to the extent that your cash values are invested in the variable options your policy has no guaranteed cash value who can buy a park avenue vul policy you can buy a vul policy if o you live in a state or jurisdiction where we offer the policy and o the person being insured is under age  and meets our insurance requirements s u m m a r y p r o s p e c t u s  if you already own a fixedbenefit insurance policy from us or our parent company guardian

deductions that are due plus o the extra insurance provided by any riders included in your policy we pay these benefits in a lump sum or under one of the options described in payment options s u m m a

have to pay in premiums premiums are the payments you make to buy and keep your insurance in force there are several types of premiums associated with your park avenue vul which together form your policy premium they are o the initial premium which you pay to begin your policy is at least onequarter of your minimum annual premium o the minimum annual premium which is set out in your policy it is used to calculate the amount of premium that must be paid as of the most recent monthly date to satisfy the no lapse guarantee premium test during the first three years of your policy o your planned premium which is the monthly premium that you choose when you apply for a policy you do not have to pay your planned premium however we will send you reminder notices for them o your target premium which is based on the insureds age sex unless genderneutral rates are required by law and underwriting class it is used to determine premium charges and agent commissions you have a separate target premium for your policy and for each policy segment that you add to your policy in order to increase its face amount o rider premiums for any additional coverage you have added to your policy through a rider other than the guaranteed coverage rider after you have paid the initial premium you may pay premiums on your policy at any time and in any amount during the lifetime of the insured however if the cash value of your policy is not able to cover the monthly deductions from your policy your policy may lapse unless the no lapse guarantee is in effect and you have satisfied its requirements we will warn you if your policy is in danger of lapsing  p r o s p e c t u s s u m m a r y allocation options you choose where your net premiums are invested there are a number of

investment objectives policies risks fees and expenses for each of these funds listed in the accompanying prospectus for that fund you should read the corresponding fund prospectus carefully before investing in any variable investment option for a summary of this information see the variable investment options the fixedrate option earns a set rate of interest the interest rate is guaranteed from the time you allocate net premiums or transfer policy values to the fixedrate option until your next policy anniversary when the rate is set for the next year you earn interest on the total that you have invested in the fixedrate option including interest you have earned in previous years interest accrues daily at a minimum annual interest rate of  giac sets the rate of interest for the fixedrate option and guarantees your principal and interest under this option can you transfer the money in your policy among different allocation options provided the money in your policy is not being held as collateral against a loan you can transfer it among the variable investment options and into the fixedrate option at any time you may choose up to seven allocation options at any time we limit transfers out of the fixedrate option see the fixedrate option withdrawing money after your policy has been in force for one year you may within limits make partial withdrawals of your policys net cash surrender value you may also borrow up to  of your policys cash surrender value you may at any time surrender your policy for the net cash surrender value do you have access to the money youve invested in your policy after your policy has been in force for one year you may within limits make partial withdrawals of your policys net cash surrender value the net cash surrender value is your policy account value minus any surrender charges and policy debt you may also borrow up to  of your policys cash surrender value the cash surrender value is the policy account value minus any surrender charges we will charge you an annual interest rate of  calculated daily on all outstanding loans that you have taken against your policy this rate will decrease to  after your policys th anniversary or after the insured reaches attained age  you may at any time surrender your policy for the net cash surrender value after you surrender your policy you no longer have insurance coverage and your policy cannot be reinstated  p r o s p e c t u s s u m m a r y tax on increases increases in the value of your policy should not be taxed unless you make a withdrawal or in some cases take a loan or surrender your policy before the insured dies how is your policy affected by taxes increases in the value of your policy and the death benefit we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that your park avenue vul policy will receive the tax benefits generally associated with life insurance contracts under existing federal tax laws this means that increases in the value of your policy should not be taxed unless you make a withdrawal or in some cases take a loan or surrender your policy before the insured dies partial withdrawals surrenders and policy loans all result in money being taken out of your policy before the insured dies we believe that the money the beneficiary receives when the insured dies generally should not be subject to federal income tax but may be subject to federal estate taxes or generation skipping transfer taxes see tax considerations what deductions and charges do you have to pay there are various deductions and charges associated with maintaining your park avenue vul policy each of these charges is outlined below and in detail in deductions and charges some of these charges can vary depending on certain circumstances and there may be a guaranteed or maximum charge and a current charge the guaranteed or maximum charge is the most that we can charge you for a particular item the current charge is what we are now charging for that item we have the right to increase the current charge up to the maximum charge where the law requires we will tell you if we increase these charges charges deducted from your policy premiums premium charge a charge of between  and  is deducted from each premium you pay to cover premium taxes assessed against us by the jurisdictions where the policy is issued plus a portion of any federal income taxes and premium sales charges monthly deductions we deduct these charges from your policy account value on the same date each month the monthly deductions are as follows policy administration charge this charge has two parts the contract charge equals  a month for the first year and  a month thereafter the coverage charge equals  for every  of your policys face amount for the first year of coverage and for one year after any increase in the face amount the per  charge is lower if the insured is under age  at issue s u m m a r y p r o s p e c t u s  cost of insurance charge this charge is based on our current cost of insurance rates for those of the same age sex and underwriting class as the insured under your policy the maximum that we can charge for each  of the net amount at risk the difference between your policy account value and your policys death benefit is set out in your policy charges for additional insurance benefits if you buy additional insurance coverage by adding one or more riders to your policy the charges will be deducted monthly from your policy account value after the anniversary closest to the insureds th birthday we no longer collect these monthly deductions transaction deductions we deduct these charges from the policy account value when you ask us to do certain transactions the charges are as follows surrender charge during the first  policy years this charge applies if you surrender your policy let it lapse or reduce the face amount either because you ask us to or as the result of a partial withdrawal this charge is a flat rate for every  of your policys face amount and is outlined in your policy it declines proportionally each year until it is zero after  years and varies depending on the insureds age when the policy was issued sex and premium class partial withdrawal charge if you make a partial withdrawal from your policy a surrender charge will only be triggered if the withdrawal is more than you are allowed under the free partial withdrawal outlined in your policy transfer charge after you make twelve transfers of policy account value among the allocation options within a policy year we may charge you  for each additional transfer we dont currently impose this charge  p r o s p e c t u s s u m m a r y deductions associated with the separate account we deduct a daily charge based on an annual rate of  from the variable investment options to cover the mortality and expense risks that we assume for park avenue vul policies this charge will be reduced to an annual rate of  after your policys th anniversary we also have the right to charge the separate account to cover any taxes that are applicable to the separate account or the policies we dont currently impose this charge deductions associated with the mutual funds daily deductions are made from the value of the mutual funds in which you invest through the separate account to cover advisory fees and other expenses as a result you pay these fees and expenses indirectly the fees and expenses vary for each mutual fund and are described in more detail in the fund prospectuses policy changes with certain restrictions you may o request an increase or decrease in the face amount of your policy o exchange your park avenue vul policy for a fixed benefit life insurance policy o cancel your policy after it has been issued see accompanying text for details what changes can you make to your policy decreasing the face amount of the policy after your policy has been in force for one year you may request a decrease in the face amount the decrease must be at least  and the insured must be alive when we receive your request if you ask us to reduce the face amount in the first  years of your policy you will pay a surrender charge the new face amount cannot be lower than giacs current minimum face amount if a decrease is caused by a partial withdrawal either in the first  years of your policy or within  years of increasing the face amount and you withdraw more than the free withdrawal amount allowed under your policy we will charge you a surrender charge see decreasing the face amount increasing the face amount of the policy on your first policy anniversary and on each anniversary until the insureds th birthday you may request an increase in your policys face amount the increase must be for at least  the amount of each increase

may cancel your policy by returning it with a written cancellation notice to either our executive office or the agent from whom you bought the policy you must do this within o  days after you receive your policy or o  days after you sign part  of the completed application for your policy longer periods may apply in some states once we receive your notice we will refund all of the premiums you paid and your policy will be considered void from the beginning see your right to cancel your policy could your policy lapse your policy may lapse if you dont pay a policy premium within  days of the due date or if you have excess policy debt could your policy lapse your policy may lapse if its net cash surrender value is less than zero after deducting the monthly deductions in a given month and you do not make a premium payment to correct this imbalance within  days of the time the monthly deductions are due for the first three years of your policy the no lapse guarantee ensures that it will not lapse even if high surrender charges or poor investment performance results in the net cash surrender value of your policy being insufficient to pay the policys monthly deductions in a given month so

giving you a policy date up to six months before the application was actually signed backdating your policy may be beneficial if for example it would allow you to qualify for a lower premium because the insured was younger on the policy date we deduct the monthly deductions due from the backdated policy date to the issue date a b o u t t h e p o l i c y p r o s p e c t u s  the policyowner the policyowner is the person named on the application as the owner of the policy you may own a policy jointly with more than one person a policyowner does not have to be the insured the policyowner the policyowner is the person named on the application as the owner of the policy you may own a policy jointly with more than one person a policyowner does not have to be the insured while the insured is

policys joint owners must approve policy transactions or changes in writing including assigning ownership of the policy to someone else when a joint policyowner dies we will divide his or her share of the policy equally among the other policyowners unless the deceased policyowner has indicated otherwise if you want to change the policyowner you must request it in writing in a form acceptable to us your request must be signed and dated by all of the policyowners the change will be made effective on the date your request was signed but will not apply to any payments or actions taken before we receive your request if you are not the insured and die before the insured your estate or if there had been joint owners the estate of the last surviving joint owner becomes the policyowner unless you have named someone to take over ownership of the policy a successor owner if you are both the policyowner and the insured a successor owner may not be named because the policy ends when you die the beneficiary the beneficiary is the person you name to receive the proceeds when the insured dies the beneficiary the beneficiary is the person you name to receive the proceeds when the insured dies you can change the beneficiary until the insured dies also you may name a contingent beneficiary who will receive the proceeds if the first beneficiary dies before the insured or a second or concurrent beneficiary who will receive a portion of the proceeds when the insured dies the beneficiary must live longer than the insured to qualify as a beneficiary and has no rights under the policy until the insured dies if the insured outlives all of the beneficiaries named in the policy then the policyowner or the policyowners estate becomes the beneficiary if you want to change the beneficiary you must give us your instructions in writing in a form acceptable to us your request must be signed and dated by all of the policyowners listed in our records the change is made effective on the date your request was signed but will not apply to any payments or actions taken before we receive your request  p r o s p e c t u s a b o u t t h e p o l i c y benefits and policy values no lapse guarantee the no lapse guarantee ensures that your policy will not lapse even if high surrender charges or poor investment performance means that the net cash surrender value of your policy is not enough to pay the policys monthly deductions in a given month this guarantee is in effect for the first three years of your policy so long as the no lapse guarantee premium test is met this test states that as of the most recent monthly date you must have paid at least as much into your policy minus any withdrawals surrender charges or policy debt as the minimum annual premiums up to this date as stated on page  of your policy to calculate your minimum annual premium for the current policy year divide the number of days since your policy anniversary by  then multiply your minimum annual premium by this figure if you change the face amount of your policy after the first policy year your minimum annual premium will change which in turn changes the amount that you must contribute in order to meet the no lapse guarantee premium test as of the most recent monthly date you must have paid at least as much into your policy minus any withdrawals surrender charges or policy debt as the original minimum annual premium for the period up to the increase or decrease plus the new minimum annual premium for the period after the increase or decrease in your policys face amount multiplied by the ratio obtained by dividing the number of days since the increase or decrease by  if your policy does not meet the no lapse guarantee premium test you will have a day grace period from the date of default to make a required premium payment or loan repayment if there is outstanding policy debt if you do not make the required payment the policy will lapse then if the policy is reinstated the no lapse guarantee will not be reinstated once this guarantee has been terminated it cannot be reinstated death benefit options you have a choice of two death benefit options with this policy if a fixed amount of insurance coverage and potentially lower monthly deductions best fits your needs you should choose option  if you want the potential to increase the amount of your insurance coverage beyond your policys face amount you should choose option  see accompanying text for details death benefit options you have a choice of two death benefit options with this policy you should choose the death benefit option that best meets your insurance needs and investment objectives if a fixed amount of insurance coverage and potentially lower monthly deductions best fit your needs you should choose option  if you want the potential to increase the amount of your insurance coverage beyond your policys face amount you should choose option  option  under option  your death benefit is the greater of o the face amount on the date of the insured persons death b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l u e s p r o s p e c t u s  o the minimum death benefit required under section  of the internal revenue code on the monthly date before the insureds death under this option if your investments perform well or you contribute more than the minimum annual premium and the policy account value increases by a sufficient amount then the net amount at risk will be lower when this happens the amount that we deduct for the cost of insurance charges each month may also go down option  under option  your death benefit is the greater of o the face amount on the date of the insured persons death plus the policy amount value as of the monthly date before the insureds death or o the minimum death benefit required under section  of the internal revenue code on the monthly date before the insureds death under this option if your investments perform well or you contribute more than the minimum annual premium your policy account value may increase enough to increase your death benefit if your investments perform poorly your death benefit could be lower but it will never be lower than the face amount the net amount at risk will not change unless we have to increase the death benefit to comply with section  of the internal revenue code regardless of which option you choose after the policy anniversary closest to the insureds th birthday the death benefit is the policy account value the tax consequences of continuing the policy beyond the insureds th birthday are unclear you should consult a tax adviser for more information if you make a partial withdrawal from your policy between the most recent monthly date and the death of the insured the death benefit under both options will be reduced by the amount of your withdrawal plus any applicable charges to qualify as insurance under the internal revenue code both option  and option  must pay at least the minimum death benefit required under section  we calculate this minimum using one of two methods the cash value accumulation test cash value test or the guideline premium and cash value corridor test guideline premium test you decide which method you want used when you complete your application once youve made your choice you cannot change it  p r o s p e c t u s b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l u e s both tests are explained below here are some guidelines for choosing between the cash value test and the guideline premium test test advantages  cash value test guideline premium test  o allows you to make more o allows later death benefit premium payments than the increases than the guideline premium test cash value test  o increases the death benefit earlier o develops larger policy than the guideline premium test account values  cash value test to satisfy this test the death benefit must be at least equal to the policy account value divided by the net single premium the premium which would be needed to pay for future benefits under the policy a table of net single premiums appears in your policy guideline premium test the guideline premium test consists of two parts the guideline premium test and the cash value corridor test to satisfy the guideline premium test the total of all premiums you pay must not exceed certain maximums the total of premiums paid minus the nontaxable portion of partial withdrawals must not be greater than the larger of the following o the guideline single premium on the date the calculation is done or o the sum of the guideline level premiums to the date the calculation is done for the purposes of this test the guideline single premium is the premium that would be necessary to pay for future benefits under the policy as calculated at the time the policy is issued its based on the mortality charges stated in the policy other current charges specified in the policy and an effective annual interest rate of  the guideline level premium is the level annual premium payable at least until the insured reaches age  its based on mortality charges and other current charges specified in the policy and an effective annual interest rate of  annual premiums paid may exceed the guideline premium test if those premiums are necessary to keep the policy in force b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l u e s p r o s p e c t u s  to satisfy the cash value corridor test the death benefit must at least equal the percentage of the policy account value shown in the following table percentage of policy attained age account value                                                     the percentage decreases uniformly as attained age increases within the age ranges the minimum death benefit required on any monthly date is as follows o under the cash value test one thousand times the policy account value on the monthly date divided by the net single premium per  for the insureds attained age sex unless the law requires the same rate for both sexes and underwriting class the net single premium is adjusted to the monthly date immediately before the date of death see the table of net single premiums in your policy o under the guideline premium test the policy account value on the monthly date immediately before the insureds death multiplied by the factor shown in the table of death benefit factors in your policy  p r o s p e c t u s b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l u e s changing your death benefit option after the first anniversary of your policy you may change your death benefit option once each policy year as long as the insured is alive when we make the change you must send us your instructions in writing at our executive offices such changes take effect on the business day that we approve them changing the death benefit option may have adverse tax consequences you should consult a tax adviser before doing so if you change the death benefit option we will change the policys face amount to keep the death benefit the same immediately before and after the change if youre changing from option  to option  the face amount will decrease by the amount of the policy account value on the date the change takes effect if youre changing from option  to option  the face amount will increase by the amount of the policy account value if you are changing from option  to option  you must prove that the insured meets our insurance requirements we wont approve any request to change the option if monthly deductions are being waived under the waiver of monthly deductions rider we wont deduct a surrender charge or impose new surrender charges in connection with changes in the death benefit option minimum death benefit the minimum death benefit required under section  of the internal revenue code on any monthly date is  multiplied by the policy account value then divided by the net single premium per  for the insureds attained age sex and underwriting class the net single premium on any monthly date is determined by interpolation between the net single premiums for the policy anniversaries immediately before and after that monthly date the net single premium is adjusted to the monthly date immediately before the insureds death you will find a table of net single premiums in your policy paying the death benefit we will pay a death benefit to the beneficiaries named in your policy when we receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was in effect if there is reason to dispute the policy then we may delay the payment of death benefits see limits to giacs right to challenge a policy policy values the following is a detailed breakdown of how we calculate the different values associated with your policy amounts in the separate account any net premiums that you allocate or transfer to a variable investment option are used to buy shares in the mutual fund corresponding to the variable investment option according to your instructions we will sell these shares when you make a withdrawal transfer or take a policy loan or when we withdraw your monthly deductions or make dollar cost averaging transfers based on the value of each share on the transaction date we will sell the number of shares needed to cover the cost of that transaction b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l u e s p r o s p e c t u s  each of the variable investment options has two unit values the first applies until the th policy anniversary when your policys mortality and expense risk charge is  after the th policy anniversary this charge falls to  to make this change on your th policy anniversary we will sell all of your units for which the  charge applies and buy new units which use a  charge with the proceeds to calculate the value of your investment in a particular variable investment option multiply the unit value of the option by the number of units you own unit values change based on the investment performance of mutual fund shares and the daily deductions that are made to cover our mortality and expense risks we calculate the unit value for each variable investment option at the end of each day note that you bear all risks associated with the investments in the separate account policy account value policy account value is the total value of the investments held in your policy this includes the value of your allocations to the fixedrate and variable investment options and any policy values that may be in the loan collateral account as collateral for a policy loan it is calculated as o net premiums that you contribute to your policy plus or minus o any profit or loss generated by your policy account value in the variable investment options plus o any interest you earn on allocations to the fixedrate option or interest we credit on the loan collateral account minus o your total monthly deductions minus o any partial withdrawals youve made minus o any surrender partial withdrawal or transfer charges cash surrender value and net cash surrender value cash surrender value is the policy account value minus any surrender charges there are no surrender charges after your policy has been in effect for  years net cash surrender value is the amount you would actually receive if you surrendered your life insurance policy cash surrender value and net cash surrender value this is the policy account value minus any surrender charges there are no surrender charges after your policy has been in effect for  years and for the first  years of each additional policy segment created by increasing the face amount net cash surrender value is the amount you would actually receive if you surrendered your life insurance policy it is your policy account value minus any surrender charges and policy debt  p r o s p e c t u s b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l u e s the value of any investments in the variable investment options may increase or decrease daily depending on how well the investments perform a combination of partial withdrawals policy loans unfavorable investment performance and ongoing monthly deductions can cause a policys net cash surrender value to drop below zero even if this happens the policy will not lapse during the first three policy years if the no lapse guarantee is in effect and the no lapse guarantee test is satisfied see no lapse guarantee certain rider benefits available under the policy may also prevent your policy from lapsing see appendix c net investment factor we calculate the unit value of each variable investment option by multiplying the options immediately preceding unit value by the net investment factor for that day we use two unit values for each of the variable investment options one that applies before your th policy anniversary and one that applies after we calculate the net investment factor as follows on each business day o the net asset value of one share of the mutual fund corresponding to the variable investment option at the close of the current business day plus o the amount per share of any dividends or capital gains distributed by the fund on the current business day divided by o the net asset value of one share of the same mutual fund at the close of the previous business day minus o the total daily charges we deduct from the variable investment option to cover mortality and expense risks which will not exceed  per day or  annually until the th policy anniversary and  per day or  annually thereafter as well as any federal state or local taxes on a day that is not a business day the net investment factor is calculated by subtracting the total daily charges deducted from the variable investment option to cover mortality and expense risks as well as any taxes from  currently we do not make daily deductions from the separate account to cover income taxes the accompanying prospectuses for each fund describe how they calculate the net asset values of their mutual fund shares b e n e f i t s a n d p o l i c y v a l

least one quarter of your minimum annual premium the minimum annual premium is outlined in your policy and is used to calculate your initial premium and compliance with the no lapse guarantee premium test when you set up your policy you must choose a planned premium this is the premium that you intend to pay periodically we will send you a reminder when your planned premium is due unless you are paying your premiums through a preauthorized checking plan you are under no obligation to pay this premium all premiums must be paid to giacs executive office each premium you pay must be at least

limit the amount that you can pay into your policy including refusing or refunding premiums you pay to ensure that your policy is considered life insurance under federal tax laws we have the right to refuse or refund any premium that increases your death benefit because of the requirements of section  of the internal revenue code but we will accept such a premium if o it does not increase your policys death benefit as a result of section  or o the sum of the policy premiums you have paid during the current policy year does not exceed  of your policys target premium or o the sum of the policy premiums you have paid during the current policy year does not exceed  of the target premium and  of your largest premium payment during the past three policy years or o you have chosen the

deductions and charges there are various deductions and charges required to maintain your park avenue vul policy the amount of a charge does not necessarily correspond to our costs in providing the service or benefits associated with a particular policy for example the sales portion of the premium charge and the surrender charge may not cover all of our actual sales expenses for the policies and proceeds from other charges including the mortality and expense risk charge and cost of insurance charges may be used in part to cover sales expenses once deductions and charges are taken from your policy they do not contribute to the value of your policy all of the deductions and charges are summarized and explained below premium charge a charge of  is deducted from each premium you pay until your premiums equal the amount of  target premiums for your policy once this amount has been reached the charge will fall to  it will fall again to  when your premiums equal the amount of  target premiums for your policy the premium charge covers a portion of our sales and promotional expenses commissions and local state and federal taxes you may not claim the portion of these charges used to pay taxes as a federal income tax deduction your policy has a separate target premium for the initial face amount and for any additional coverage you have added through policy segments the premium charge will be applied in the order that these were issued in order to calculate your premium charge we will allocate each premium you pay as follows o first to your policys initial face amount up to the target premium for that amount o then to any policy segments that are in force in the order that they were purchased up to the target premium for each segment o then proportionately based on the target premium among the initial face amount and any policy segments that are in force  p r e m i u m s d e d u c t i o n s  p r o s p e c t u s a n d c h a r g e s example a  yearold male preferred

the policy account value on the same date each month an amount to cover administration costs and the cost of insuring the insured these deductions are made proportionately from your investments in the fixedrate and variable investment options monthly deductions from the policy account value we deduct from the policy account value on the same date each month an amount to cover administration costs and the cost of insuring the insured these deductions are made proportionately from your policy account value in the fixedrate and variable investment options we do not make these monthly deductions after the policy anniversary closest to the insureds th birthday policy and administration charges on each monthly date we deduct a contract charge of  a month until the first anniversary of your policy then  a month after that we also deduct a coverage charge the amount of the coverage charge depends on your age when the policy is issued for issue ages  and above we deduct the coverage charge at the rate of  cents per  of face amount until the first anniversary of the policy theres also a coverage charge of  cents per  of any increase in the face amount until the first anniversary of the increase the coverage charge is lower if the insured is under  years of age at age  we deduct the coverage charge at the rate of  per  of face amount until the first anniversary of the policy theres also a charge of  per  of any face amount increase until the first anniversary of the increase below age  the rate decreases by  for each year in age down to the minimum of  per  at age  the policy administration charge helps compensate us for the cost of underwriting and issuing your policy and for the costs of maintaining the policy these costs include preparing and sending premium billing notices reports and statements to policyholders communications with insurance agents and other overhead costs related to policies cost of insurance charge cost of insurance charges enable us to pay death benefits especially in the early policy years when the policy account value is far below the death benefit we pay if the insured dies this charge is based on our cost of insurance rates for insured people of the same age sex face amount and underwriting class any additional rating charges which are applied to the insured because he or she does not satisfy our insurance requirements for standard insurance are added to the cost of insurance charge the maximum that we can charge for each  of net amount at risk is set out in your policy and is based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables  p r e m i u m s d e d u c t i o n s  p r o s p e c t u s a n d c h a r g e s published by the national association of insurance commissioners the cost of insurance rate generally increases as the insured gets older rates are lower for policies with an initial face amount at least equal to  or where there has been a face amount increase of at least  if the policy is eligible for the lower rates they will apply to the initial face amount and all policy segments our current cost of insurance rates are lower than the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance charge this charge allows us to pay death benefits especially in the early policy years when the policy account value is far below the death benefit we pay if the insured dies we calculate the cost of insurance charge by multiplying your policys net amount at risk each month by the current cost of insurance rate that applies to the insured and dividing the result by  your net amount at risk is determined after all other monthly deductions have been withdrawn from your policy account we may change the cost of insurance rates prospectively at our discretion up to the guaranteed maximum rate listed in your policy changes in the health of the insured will not cause your cost of insurance charge to increase increases in the cost of insurance rates are not made to an individual policy but are made equally to all policies where the insured people are of the same attained age sex and premium class we will increase this charge when we expect o a higher number of deaths among people in a certain group o higher expenses or federal income taxes o a higher number of policies that are allowed to lapse by their policyowners o changes in our federal income tax costs imposed on us by section  of the internal revenue code o changes in the premium taxes that we pay or o lower earnings in our general account generally reducing the net amount at risk results in lower charges for cost of insurance decreasing the net amount at risk partly depends on the death benefit option you choose the two options are explained under death benefit options if you choose option  in which the death benefit is the face amount of your policy you reduce the net amount at risk when you pay premiums thats because premiums increase the policy account value if you choose option  in which the death benefit can increase to more than the face amount paying premiums will not affect the net amount at risk p r e m i u m s d e d u c t i o n s  a n d c h a r g e s p r o s p e c t u s  the net amount at risk can increase for example when we increase a policys death benefit to meet the requirements of the internal revenue code see death benefit options having a higher net amount at risk results in higher deductions for cost of insurance there may be different cost of insurance rates for the initial face amount of your policy and for each subsequent increase in the face amount as a result we calculate the net amount at risk separately for each level of insurance your policy account value is allocated first to your policys initial face amount then to each policy segment in the order that they were acquired the maximum amount of your policy account value that will be allocated to any one policy segment or to the initial face amount is the amount that the policy segment or initial face amount provides as a death benefit divided by  for the purposes of determining the net amount at risk any increase in your policys death benefit that is caused by section  of the internal revenue code will be allocated to the initial face amount charges for additional insurance benefits if you acquire additional insurance benefits by buying one or more riders to the policy you must pay rider premiums we deduct these from the policy account value monthly transaction deductions from the policy account value when you ask us to make certain transactions we will take a transaction deduction from your policy account value except as described differently below we will make these deductions from your policy account value invested in the variable investment options until these are exhausted and then from your fixedrate option surrender charge during the first  years of the initial face amount and each policy segment you pay a surrender charge if you o surrender your policy o reduce your policys face amount either by asking us to reduce it or through a partial withdrawal o let your policy go into default or o let your policy lapse  p r e m i u m s d e d u c t i o n s  p r o s p e c t u s a n d c h a r g e s we will not deduct a surrender charge if your policys face amount is reduced because you change the death benefit option or if you reduce or eliminate your coverage under a term rider this charge is a flat rate for every  of your policys face amount the rate declines proportionally each year until it is zero after  years and varies from  to  per  depending on the insureds age when the policy started sex and underwriting class a separate surrender charge is also calculated for each new policy segment based on the coverage it provides and the insureds age when it was added to your policy this means that the total surrender charges under your policy will be the sum of the different surrender charges for your initial face amount and each policy segment the surrender charge compensates us for administrative and salesrelated expenses surrender charges for specific ages sex and underwriting classes are set out in appendix d of this prospectus we prorate the surrender charges in connection with a face amount decrease by multiplying the surrender charges by the following fraction to reduce the charges payable amount of decrease face amount just before decrease we deduct the adjusted surrender charge from the unloaned policy account value which is your policy account value minus any policy debt after we deduct any applicable surrender charge a policys net cash surrender value may be zero particularly in the early policy years p r e m i u m s d e d u c t i o n s  a n d c h a r g e s p r o s p e c t u s  surrender charges example policy with initial face amount only the example on the right shows how the surrender charge declines over a fifteen year period so that in year  it equals  male insured age   preferred plus underwriting class nonsmoker  face amount   surrender charge per  of face amount in policy year one from appendix d   surrender charge in policy year one is the surrender charge per  multiplied by  or  x  divided by    proportional reduction in surrender charge over  year period  divided by  or  per year  is rounded to  all figures in the table following are rounded to the nearest     surrender charge per actual  of face surrender policy amount charge year                                                                    assume in the above example the insured effects a face amount increase of  at the beginning of policy year  attained age  and another face amount increase of  at the beginning of policy year  attained age  at the time of the first increase the insured is again classified in the preferred plus underwriting class but at the time of the second increase he is classified in the preferred underwriting class for the purposes of calculating the applicable surrender charges each face amount increase is treated separately based on the insureds attained age and underwriting class at the time of the increase therefore for each increase the policy will incur a new set of surrender charges surrender charges are calculated as if the policyowner has purchased a policy with the amount of the increase being the face amount in other words they are calculated just as in the first example the total surrender charge for a particular policy year equals the sum of the surrender charge for the initial face amount and the applicable surrender charge for each policy segment first year annual age

when taking out a policy loan you should consider o amounts transferred out of the variable and fixedrate options and into our loan collateral account are no longer affected by the investment

interest rate repaying your policy loan you may repay all or part of any outstanding policy debt at any time while the insured is alive and the policy is in force the minimum loan repayment amount is  or the outstanding balance of your policy debt whichever is lower if the insured has died and the death benefit proceeds have not been paid either in cash or under a payment option you have  days after his or her death to repay any policy debt we will then increase the amount payable to the beneficiary by the amount of your repayment when you make a loan repayment we transfer out of the loan collateral account the amount of your repayment minus a proportional amount of any accrued interest owing plus a proportional amount of any accrued interest we owe you on the amount that was being held in the loan collateral account your repayment will be credited first to the fixedrate option up to the amount that was deducted for your loan then into the variable investment options according to your current allocation instructions the amount credited to the fixedrate option will earn the interest rate in effect at that time until the next policy anniversary transfers under your policy that are made in connection with policy loans are not subject to transfer charges also loan repayments are not subject to premium charges so it may be to your advantage if you have outstanding loans or interest to make loan repayments rather than premium payments if on any monthly date you owe more in loans and interest than your cash surrender value we will notify you that a loan repayment is

will pay at death or maturity decreasing the face amount after the first year of your policy you may request a reduction in its face amount which is the guaranteed minimum amount your policy will pay at death or maturity to do this we require that o you make your request in writing and we receive it at our executive office o the insured is alive when we receive your request o the reduction is at least  unless it is caused by a partial withdrawal in which case the partial withdrawal rules apply o the new face amount is not lower than our minimum face amount currently  and o the monthly deductions are not currently being waived under a waiver of monthly deductions rider we reduce your face amount on the monthly date coinciding with or next following the date we approve your request if you reduce the face amount in the first  years of your policy or within  years of increasing the face amount we will deduct a surrender charge from your policy account value to calculate the surrender charge for this transaction we add the surrender charge associated with the initial face amount and the surrender charges for any policy segments that are being decreased your death benefit option will determine how your policy is affected by a reduction in the face amount due to a partial withdrawal o under option  a partial withdrawal will typically cause an immediate reduction in your policys face amount o under option  a partial withdrawal will not reduce your policys face amount however the amount of your death benefit will decline with each partial withdrawal if you have made one or more increases to the initial face amount by adding policy segments and then request a face amount decrease we will apply the decrease to your policy segments first we start with the most recent policy segment followed by the next most recent and so on and finally reduce the initial face amount  p r o s p e c t u s s p e c i a l f e a t u r e s when you reduce your policys face amount we reduce the premiums benefits and certain charges that are calculated using the face amount these include o your minimum annual premium o surrender charges o policy account value o your monthly deductions o your target premiums and o any additional rider coverage we will send you new policy pages reflecting the changes resulting from your reduction in the face amount reducing the face amount of your policy may have tax consequences including possibly causing it to be considered a modified endowment contract under the internal revenue code see tax considerations if you reduce the face amount well monitor premium payments to make sure they conform to the requirements of section  of the code you can also reduce or cancel coverage provided by the level target death benefit term rider this does not affect the face amount of your policy likewise you can decrease the face amount of your policy without reducing the coverage of your term rider there is no surrender charge if you reduce your coverage under the term rider that could make it a cheaper option than decreasing the face amount of your policy on the other hand decreasing the face amount of your policy could result in lower cost of insurance charges consult your sales representative for advice on which option may be best for you see appendix c for more information on the level target death benefit term rider increasing the face amount on each policy anniversary you may ask us to increase your policys face amount up to the anniversary closest to the insureds th birthday to do this we require that o you make your request in writing and we receive it at our executive office at least  days before your policy anniversary o you prove that the insured meets our insurance requirements o the increase be for at least  and o the monthly deductions are not currently being waived under a waiver of monthly deductions rider s p e c i a l f e a t u r e s p r o s p e c t u s  if we approve the increase it will take effect on the policy anniversary after we receive the request provided the insured is alive on that date well send you revised policy pages reflecting the changes to your policy well issue the increase in the form of a separate policy segment each policy segment has its own underwriting class rate for cost of insurance surrender charges policy administration charge premium charge and target premium after an increase in the face amount takes effect to calculate premium charges we will allocate premium payments first to the initial face amount and then to each policy segment starting with the oldest policy segment and ending with the most recent one well allocate premiums in such a way that they wont exceed the annual target premium for the initial face amount or for each policy segment when the sum of the premiums paid during a policy year exceeds the target premium for the initial face amount we will allocate the excess to the first policy segment if the premiums you pay during a policy year exceed the target premiums for all the policy segments and the initial face amount well allocate the excess proportionately according to the target premium for the initial face amount and each policy segment if you increase the face amount of your policy it will be subject to new surrender charges well calculate the surrender charges as if you had bought a new policy for the increase in the face amount a new year surrender charge will apply to the policy segment that increased the face amount well notify you about the new surrender charge after any increase in the face amount as with buying a policy you have a right to cancel any increase in the face amount within certain limitations see right to cancel you dont have to pay an additional premium to increase the face amount however you may have to make a premium payment to prevent the policy from going into default thats because the new surrender charges triggered by an increase in the face amount would automatically reduce the net cash surrender value of the policy depending on your circumstances a premium payment may be necessary to keep the net cash surrender value above zero increasing the face amount of your policy may have tax consequences including possibly causing your policy to be considered a modified endowment contract the tax consequences associated with your policy being classified as a modified endowment contract are discussed in tax considerations  p r o s p e c t u s s p e c i a l f e a t u r e s partial withdrawals after the first year of your policy you may withdraw part of your policys

your request for withdrawal in writing and the insured must be alive when you make the withdrawal the minimum net partial withdrawal is  we have the right to limit the number of partial withdrawals you make in a policy year to  if we approve your request it will be effective as of the business day we receive it at our executive office the proceeds will normally be paid within seven days of the time we receive your request for exceptions to this general rule see policy proceeds we will not approve or process a partial withdrawal if after all related charges o your remaining net cash surrender value would be insufficient to cover three monthly deductions or o if you have chosen death benefit option  the partial withdrawal would cause your policys face amount to fall below our minimum face amount we will tell you if these conditions apply we will deduct a surrender charge if your partial withdrawal causes a reduction in the initial face amount or the face amount of any policy segment during the first  years see transaction deductions from the policy account value and reducing the face amount the face amount will be reduced by the amount of any partial withdrawal that exceeds your policys free withdrawal amount plus any applicable surrender charge if you have increased your policys face amount by adding policy segments we will reduce the face amount starting with the most recent policy segment and ending with your initial face amount we will calculate the amount that is eligible for a free partial withdrawal on the date we receive your request this amount will be affected by whether you chose the cash value test or the guideline premium test to calculate your minimum death benefit when you began your policy if you chose the cash value test to calculate your minimum death benefit the amount of your free partial withdrawal will be calculated as any positive amount resulting from o your policy account value minus o your policys face amount multiplied by the net single premium outlined in your policy if your request is not made on a policy anniversary we will calculate your net single premium by comparing the net single premiums on your last and upcoming policy anniversaries and adjusting for the number of days that your request is between these two dates s p e c i a l f e a t u r e s p r o s p e c t u s  if you chose the guideline premium test the amount of your free partial withdrawal will be calculated as any positive amount resulting from o your policy account value minus o your policys face amount divided by the death benefit factor outlined in your policy we will deduct the amount of your withdrawal and any charges as follows o first from the variable investment options that you specify o if this amount is insufficient to meet your withdrawal request plus applicable charges or you have not specified a particular variable investment option then proportionately from the other variable investment options in which your policy is invested o if these amounts are still insufficient to meet your withdrawal request the remainder of the withdrawal will be deducted from your policy account value in the fixedrate option in addition to reducing your net cash surrender value partial withdrawals reduce the amount of your policys death benefit on a dollarfordollar basis as follows o under option  each partial withdrawal will typically cause an immediate equal reduction in the face amount o under option  the reduction in your death benefit will generally be the same as the reduction in your policys net cash surrender value the tax consequences of making partial withdrawals are discussed under tax considerations  p r o s p e c t u s s p e c i a l f e a t u r e s surrendering your policy you may surrender your policy for its net cash surrender value while the insured is alive your policys net cash surrender value will normally be paid within seven days of the time we receive your request surrendering your policy you may surrender your policy for its net cash surrender value while the insured is alive we will calculate your policys net cash surrender value on the business day we receive your written request which must include your policy or an acceptable affidavit confirming that youve lost your policy at our executive office your policys net cash surrender value will normally be paid within seven days of the time we receive your request your policys net cash surrender value will be calculated as follows o your policy account value including any amount held in the loan collateral account minus o any surrender charge minus o any outstanding policy debt your total surrender charges will be the total of the surrender charges for the initial face amount and for any policy segments see deductions and charges a surrender is not eligible for the free partial withdrawal benefit described above example surrender in policy year  male insured age  preferred plus underwriting class face

the guardian cash fund to a particular variable investment option or options each month over a period of time dollar cost averaging may reduce the impact of price fluctuations on unit values of the variable investment options over the period that automatic transfers are made but cannot guarantee an increase in the overall value of your investments or offer protection against losses in a declining market when you request a transfer from the fixedrate option the amounts that you have held in the fixedrate option longest will be withdrawn first the maximum that you may transfer out of the fixedrate option each policy year is either   of your allocation in the fixedrate option on the policy anniversary on or immediately preceding the date of transfer or  whichever is higher if you have less than  in the fixedrate option you may transfer the entire amount dollar cost averaging transfer option under this option you transfer the same dollar amount from the guardian cash fund to a particular variable investment option or options each month over a period of time using dollar cost averaging you purchase more units in the variable investment options when their share prices are low and fewer units when prices are higher in this way dollar cost averaging may reduce the impact of price fluctuations on unit values of the variable investment options over the period that automatic transfers are made however this strategy cannot guarantee an increase in the overall value of your investments or offer protection against losses in a declining market the amount of your monthly transfer under this option must be at least  for each variable investment option you wish to invest in and it must remain in effect for at least  months amounts will be transferred automatically on each monthly date from the guardian cash fund into the variable investment options you have chosen before the program can begin you must submit an authorization form your policy account value in the guardian cash fund must also equal your monthly transfer amount multiplied by the number of months you have chosen for example  per month x  months   we will tell you if you have not met this requirement and will not begin the program until you have you can extend the dollar cost averaging program beyond the initial number of months chosen by adding to your policy account value in the guardian cash fund we will stop your dollar cost averaging program when o the period of time listed on your dollar cost averaging authorization form ends or o your policy account value in the guardian cash fund is insufficient to cover your monthly investment in the variable investment options you have chosen if this happens we will divide what you do have in the guardian cash fund among the variable investment options you have chosen leaving a balance of zero in the guardian cash fund s p e c i a l f e a t u r e s p r o s p e c t u s  o you tell us in writing to end the program and we receive this notice at least three days before the next monthly date o your policy lapses or you surrender it or o a policy value option takes effect you may change your transfer instructions or reinstate the dollar cost averaging program subject to the rules above if we receive a new authorization form at least three days before your policys next monthly date policy proceeds the amount that your beneficiaries will receive upon the death of the insured is determined as explained under death benefit options and is payable when we receive proof that the insured has died while the policy was in effect it will include o the death proceeds based on the death benefit option you have chosen plus o the proceeds of any coverage you have added to your policy through riders minus o any outstanding policy debt or monthly deductions we may adjust the death proceeds paid to the beneficiaries if o the age or sex listed on the policy application is incorrect o the insured commits suicide within two years of the policy issue date a change in the face amount or the date a change in the death benefit from option  to option  takes effect but only for any increase in the death benefit over your policys face amount that was a result of the change or o there are limits imposed by riders to the policy if the insured has reached the attained age of  or older the death proceeds will be the policy account value minus any policy debt as of the date of death the amount of all other transactions will be calculated at the end of the business day on which we receive the necessary instructions

insurance contract and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law a life insurance policy must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in section  of the internal revenue code for example the underlying investments must be adequately diversified in order for the policy to be treated as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes it is intended that the investment divisions of the separate account through the mutual funds will satisfy these diversification requirements this discussion of tax considerations for your park avenue vul policy is general in nature does not purport to be complete or to cover all tax situations and should not be considered as tax advice it is based on our understanding of the federal income tax laws as they are currently being interpreted we cannot guarantee that these laws will not change while this prospectus is in use or while your policy is in force if you are interested in purchasing a policy taking a policy loan or effecting policy transactions you should consult a legal or tax adviser regarding your particular circumstances tax status of the policy in order to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes and to receive the tax treatment normally accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law a life insurance policy must satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in section  of the internal revenue code guidance as to how these requirements are to be applied is limited accordingly there is some uncertainty about the application of section  to a policy particularly so with respect to policies issued on an insured who does not meet our standard insurance requirements nevertheless we believe it is reasonable to conclude that your policy should satisfy the applicable requirements if it is subsequently determined that a policy does not satisfy the applicable requirements we may take appropriate steps to bring the policy into compliance with such requirements and we reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary in order to do so in certain circumstances owners of variable life insurance policies have been considered for federal income tax purposes to be the owners of the assets of the separate account supporting their contracts due to their ability to exercise investment control over those assets where this is the case the policyowners have been currently taxed on income and gains attributable to separate account assets there is little guidance in this area and some features of the park avenue vul policy such as your flexibility to allocate premiums and the policy account value have not been explicitly addressed in published rulings while we believe that the policy does not give policyowners investment control over the separate accounts assets we reserve the right to modify the policy as necessary to prevent the policyowner from being treated as the owner of the separate account assets supporting the policy in addition the code requires that the investments of the investment divisions of our separate account be adequately diversified in order for the policy to be treated as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes it is intended that the investment divisions of the separate account through the mutual funds will satisfy these diversification requirements the following discussion assumes that the policy will qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes  p r o s p e c t u s t a x c o n s i d e r a t i o n s treatment of policy proceeds we believe that the death benefits under your policy should generally be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary generally under the existing federal tax laws increases in the value of your policy will not be taxed federally unless you make a withdrawal before the insured dies treatment of policy proceeds we believe that the death benefits under your policy should generally be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary generally under the existing federal tax laws increases in the value of your policy will not be taxed federally unless you make a withdrawal before the insured dies the money that you receive when the insured dies is not subject to federal income tax but may be subject to federal estate taxes or generation skipping taxes partial withdrawals surrenders and policy loans all result in money being taken out of your policy before the insured dies how this money is taxed depends on whether your policy is classified as a modified endowment contract under the internal revenue code certain life insurance contracts are classified as modified endowment contracts with less favorable tax treatment than other life insurance contracts due to the flexibility of the policy as to premiums and benefits the individual circumstances of each policy will determine whether it is classified as a modified endowment contract the rules are too complex to be summarized here but generally depend on the amount of premium payments made during the first seven policy years certain changes in a policy after it is issued could also cause it to be classified as a modified endowment contract you should consult with a competent tax adviser to determine whether a policy transaction will cause your policy to be classified as a modified endowment contract if your policy is not considered a modified endowment contract o money that you withdraw from your policy will generally be taxed only if the total that you withdraw exceeds your basis in the policy  which is generally equal to the total amount that you have paid in premiums the difference between what you have put in and what you take out will be taxed as ordinary income when you withdraw money from your policy your basis is reduced by any amount withdrawn that is not taxed o if you surrender your policy you will generally be taxed only on the amount by which the value of your policy including any policy debt is greater than your basis in the policy the tax consequences of surrendering your policy may vary if you receive the proceeds under one of the payment plans losses are generally not tax deductible o policy loans are generally not taxable because they must be paid back the interest you pay on these loans is generally not tax deductible however if your policy lapses while you have an outstanding policy loan you may have to pay tax on the amount that you still owe to your policy the tax consequences of a policy loan are unclear if the difference between the rate we charge on the loan and the interest rate earned on the loan is very small you should consult a tax adviser regarding these consequences t a x c o n s i d e r a t i o n s p r o s p e c t u s  if your policy is considered a modified endowment contract o all distributions other than death benefits including partial withdrawals surrenders assignments and policy loans will be treated first as distributions of gain taxable as ordinary income and as a tax free recovery of basis only after all the gain in the contract has been distributed o all modified endowment contracts issued by giac or its affiliates during any calendar year will be treated as one modified endowment contract to determine the taxable portion of any distribution o a  penalty tax will also apply to any taxable distribution unless it is made to a taxpayer who is   years of age or older is attributable to a disability or is received as substantially equal periodic payments made over the life of the taxpayer or the life of the taxpayer and a beneficiary exchanges generally there are no tax consequences when you exchange one life insurance policy for another as long as the same person is being insured paying additional premiums under the new policy may cause it to be treated as a modified endowment contract your policy may also lose any grandfathering privilege where you would be exempt from certain legislative or regulatory changes made after your original policy was issued if you exchange your policy you should consult with a tax adviser if you are considering exchanging any life insurance policy policy changes we will make changes to policies and their riders where necessary to attempt to ensure that they continue to qualify as life insurance under the internal revenue code and policyowners are not considered the direct owners of the mutual funds held in the separate account any changes will be made uniformly to all policies affected we will provide advance notice in writing of these changes when required by state insurance regulators federal state and local governments may from time to time introduce new legislation concerning the taxation of life insurance policies they can also change or adopt new interpretations of existing laws and regulations without notice if you have questions about the tax consequences of your park avenue vul policy please

a policyowner or beneficiary will determine how the ownership of a policy or the receipt of policy proceeds will affect their tax situation because the rules are complex a legal or tax adviser should be consulted for specific information other tax consequences park avenue vul policies can be used in various ways including o as nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuance plans o in splitdollar insurance plans and o as part of executive bonus plans retiree medical benefits plans or other similar plans the tax consequences of these plans will vary depending on individual arrangements and circumstances we recommend that anyone considering buying a park avenue vul policy with the expectation of favorable tax consequences should consult with a qualified tax adviser

repurchase and resale agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions are used to generate net investment income and facilitate trading activity these instruments are shortterm in nature

classification for the next  illustrations values are first given based on current charges and then based on the policys higher guaranteed charges each illustration is given first for a policy with an option  death benefit and then for a policy with an option  death benefit in addition the first  illustrations will show values based on the cash value test and the next  illustrations will show values based on the guideline premium test these illustrations may assist in the comparison of death benefits net cash surrender values and policy account values for park avenue vul policies with those under other variable life insurance policies that may be issued by giac or other companies prospective policyowners are advised however that it may not be advantageous to replace existing life insurance coverage by purchasing a park avenue vul policy particularly if the decision to replace existing coverage is based primarily on a comparison of policy illustrations death benefits net cash surrender values and policy account values will be different from the amounts shown if  the actual gross rates of return average   or  but vary above and below the average over the period and  premiums are paid at other than annual intervals benefits and values will also be affected by the policyowners allocation of the unloaned policy account value among the variable investment options and the fixedrate option if the actual gross rate of return for all options averages   or  but varies above or below that average for individual options allocation and transfer decisions can have a significant impact on a policys performance policy loans and other policy transactions such as partial withdrawals will also affect results as will the insureds sex smoker status and underwriting class death benefits net cash surrender values and policy account values shown in the tables reflect the fact that  deductions have been made from premiums for premium charges and  monthly deductions are deducted from the policy account value on each monthly date the net cash surrender values shown in the tables reflect the fact that a surrender charge is deducted upon surrender face amount reduction or lapse during the first  policy years the death benefits net cash surrender values and policy account values also reflect a daily charge assessed against the separate account for mortality and expense risks equivalent to an annual charge of  of the average daily value of the assets in the separate account attributable to the policies for the first  policy years and  thereafter see

charges attributable to the separate account since no charges are currently made if any such charges are imposed in the future the gross annual rate of return would have to exceed the rates shown by an amount sufficient to cover the tax charges in order to produce the death benefits net cash surrender values and policy account values illustrated see giacs taxes the fourth column of each table shows the amount which would accumulate if an amount equal to the target premium was invested to earn interest after taxes of  per year compounded annually there can be no assurance that a prospective policyowner would be able to earn this return giac will furnish upon request an illustration reflecting the proposed insureds age sex underwriting class and the face amount requested but a

illustrations net outlay will be equal to target premium from time to time advertisements or sales literature for park avenue vul may quote historical performance data of one or more of the underlying funds and may include cash surrender values and death benefit figures computed using the same methodology as that used in the following illustrations but with historical average annual total returns of the underlying funds for which performance data is shown in the advertisement or sales literature replacing the hypothetical rates of return shown in the following tables this information may be shown in the form of graphs charts tables and examples any such information is intended to show the policys investment experience based on the historical experience of the underlying funds and is not

illustrations may be based on the actual investment experience of the funds since their respective inception dates see investment performance of the funds the results for any period prior to the policies being offered would be calculated as if the policies had been offered during that period of time with all charges assumed to be those applicable to the policies thus the illustrations will

o s p e c t u s  appendix b uses of life insurance the following are examples of ways in which the policy can be used to address certain financial objectives bearing in mind that variable life insurance is not a shortterm investment and that its primary purpose is to provide benefits upon the death of the insured family income protection life insurance may be purchased on the lives of a familys income earners to provide a death benefit to cover final expenses and continue the current income to the family the amount of insurance purchase should be an amount which will provide a death benefit that when invested outside the policy at a reasonable interest rate will generate enough money to replace the insureds income estate protection life insurance may be purchased by a trust on the life of a person whose estate will incur federal estate taxes upon his or her death the amount of insurance purchased should equal the amount of the estimated estate tax liability upon the insureds death the trustee could make the death proceeds available to the estate for the payment of estate taxes education funding life insurance may be purchased on the life of the parents or primary person funding an education the amount of insurance purchased should equal the total education cost projected at a reasonable inflation rate in the event of the insureds death the guaranteed death benefit is available to help pay the education costs if the insured lives through the education years the cash value accumulations may be accessed to help offset the remaining education costs any policy loans or partial withdrawals will reduce the policys death benefit and may have tax consequences mortgage protection life insurance may be purchased on the life of the persons responsible for making mortgage payments the amount of insurance purchased should equal the mortgage amount in the event of the insureds death the guaranteed death benefit can be used to offset the remaining mortgage balance during the insureds lifetime the cash value accumulations may be accessed late in the mortgage term to help make the remaining mortgage payments any policy loans or partial withdrawals will reduce the policys death benefit and may have tax consequences key person protection life insurance may be purchased by a business on the life of a key person in an amount equal to a key persons value considering salary benefits and contribution to business profits upon the key persons death the business can use the death benefit to ease the interruption of business operations andor to provide a replacement fund for hiring a new executive business continuation protection life insurance may be purchased on the life of each business owner in an amount equal to the value of each owners business interest in the event of death the guaranteed death benefit may provide the funds needed to carry out the purchase of the deceaseds business interest by the business or surviving owners from the deceased owners heirs retirement income life insurance may be purchased on the life of a family income earner during his or her working life if the insured lives to retirement the cash value accumulations may be accessed to provide retirement payments in the event of the insureds death the proceeds may be used to provide retirement income to his or her spouse any policy loans or partial withdrawals will reduce the policys death benefit and may have tax consequences deferred compensation plans life insurance may be purchased to fund a deferred compensation plan or selective incentive plan for key employees a deferred compensation plan or selective incentive plan is a written agreement between an employer and an executive the employer makes an unsecured promise to make future benefit payments to a key executive if the executive meets certain stated requirements under this type of plan a company purchases a cash value life insurance policy insuring an executives life to   p r o s p e c t u s a p p e n d i c e s appendix b uses of life insurance informally fund the promised benefits and  recover its plan costs at the death of the executive the policy cash values may be used to help pay the promised benefits to the executive in the event that the executive dies prior to retirement the policy death benefits can be used to fund survivor benefits split dollar plans life insurance may be purchased by an employer on the life of an employee under a split dollar plan in a split dollar plan the employer advances the executive the premium on a life insurance policy both the employer and the executive share the cash value and death benefit under the policy generally the employer has rights to the cash value and death benefit equal to its advances the balance of the cash value and death benefit belong to the executive the executive receives an economic benefit for which he or she must contribute into the plan or pay income tax the economic benefit is equal to the term value of the death benefit assuming taxation under irs revenue rulings and irc section  different results are possible if these or other code sections are applied or amended executive bonus plans life insurance may be purchased by an employee with funds provided by his or her employer for that purpose an executive bonus plan involves an employer providing an executive with additional compensation to enable the executive to pay premiums on a life insurance policy the bonus is tax deductible by the employer and received as taxable income by the executive     because the policy provides a death benefit and cash surrender value the policy can be used for various individual and business planning purposes purchasing the policy in part for such purposes entails certain risks particularly if the policys cash surrender value as opposed to its death benefit will be the principal policy feature used for such planning purposes if policy premiums are not paid the investment performance of the variable investment options to which policy account value is allocated is poorer than anticipated or insufficient cash surrender value is maintained then the policy may lapse or may not accumulate sufficient values to fund the purpose for which the policy was purchased because the policy is designed to provide benefits on a longterm basis before purchasing a policy for a specialized purpose a purchaser should consider whether the longterm nature of the policy is consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered policyowners are urged to consult competent tax advisors about the possible tax consequences of predeath distributions from any life insurance policy including park avenue life a p p e n d i c e s p r o s p e c t u s  appendix c additional
