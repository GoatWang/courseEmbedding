hitting women he might one day be black spectre review james bond is back stylish camp and sexily prosnowden read more good news for those peeved by  drinking a beer in skyfall spectre is subtle in its product placement three brands are mentioned by name – two car manufacturers and a gunmaker – and only one is an official sponsor bond drinks a vodka martini but doesn’t ask for it by brand he doles out champagne but the label’s left hidden the closeups we get of logos are of a restaurant where m ralph fiennes is eating alone and a scene where he is reading in a newspaper about an escapade in mexico that’s gone awry that’s a shot of a copy of the guardian on to which m slaps a copy of the times advertising is at play still we are a long way from the grandscale product flog of “buy another day” facebook twitter pinterest the film team review spectre daniel craig not shy about advertising his feelings on the character and the franchise has described product placement in the bond films as “a fact of life” but increasingly sponsorship in bond – at least in the craig era – has become a fact of the real world while the fiction is left alone the use of the actors in selling stuff around the films is brazen and often crass but it’s allowed sam mendes and his writing team to avoid too much outandout endorsement in spectre it’s a fair trade for fans let naomie harris race around the southbank in pursuit of a mobile phone on the telly ads so that the film stays relatively unsullied the real world also offers moments of real people rejecting the script both mendes and craig expressed doubts about the quality of the studio’s choice of mobile phone for the character in spectre there’s something delightfully contradictory and not very suave about daniel craig being paid millions to clotheshorse all this swag while bitching about it in private very offbrand daniel facebook twitter pinterest bond – moneyed stylish aspirational – has always been a potent brand for advertisers to associate themselves with but with spectre it’s almost as if the brand has branched into two the bond of the film and the bond that can be used to sell it’s a canny strategy allowing craig mendes and producer barbara broccoli to bolster both their artistic credibility and their product placement fees spectre is cornier than skyfall less gripping than casino royale the plot is baggy the realworld concerns surveillance and civil liberties are as throwaway as ever the film has its problems but product placement isn’t one of them topics spectre product placement james bond

sponsorship by rob frappier   comments  shares shareon facebook tweet share email share share pin it share comment this may come as a shock to some but movies are expensive to make especially big action movies like the james bond films that’s why more and more studios are turning to “brand partners” to help get their movies made as director morgan spurlock explored in his recent documentary the greatest movie ever sold check out our review and our interview with spurlock but can too much product placement ruin a movie what happens if corporate brands invest so much money into a film that the filmmaker loses control of the finished product no film will answer these questions better than the asyetunnamed new james bond film bond  which will set new records in product placement spending according to a new report from the australian newspaper via thefilmstagecom bond  will get an eyepopping  million in funds from product placement agreements that amount equals onethird of the film’s production budget to put that figure in perspective the film that held the record previously was steven spielberg’s minority report which received  million from product placement agreements for the math haters out there bond  is getting over twice as much money from big brands with the exception of one long action sequence that took place in a lexus factory and conveniently ended with the construction of a sleek lexus car for tom cruise to drive away in i recall minority report being pretty good about hiding product placement in the context of the story the more recent bond films on the other hand have fallen into the trap of lingering on brand names in shots and other ostentatious product placement which can be very distracting to audiences i’m a bond fan and i’m pleased that bond  is finally going into production after the mgm bankruptcy saga i’m also very excited to see what director sam mendes brings to the venerable franchise however i won’t lie and say that the product placement figures don’t bother me aston martins a product that has long been placed in bond movies the james bond franchise is highly recognizable and thus is also easily marketable it’s no wonder that big brands want to be involved in the next film one has to wonder however just how much influence  million buys in a profitdriven town like hollywood i’m betting it’s a lot more than bond fans would like what do you think of this news is product placement nothing to worry about or is it risky to receive onethird of your budget from sponsors source the australian via thefilmstagecom

all sections sign inregister is product placement out of control the tactical advantage is questionable when more than  brands can share the screen by mindi chahal  jun   pm the number of product placements in this summer’s blockbuster films is set to soar but the tactical advantage is questionable when more than  brands can share the screen to be successful marketers must ensure the creative is right and exploit additional complementary content this summer is set to be full of blockbuster films with jurassic world and entourage already in the cinema and disney’s tomorrowland a new mission impossible and a fifth film in the terminator franchise all due for release all the films will inevitably be packed with product placements entourage based on the hbo tv show features a whopping  brands in its  minutes running time according to analysis by interbrand’s brandchannelcom so has product placement gone too far or is the screen time a brand gets worth the investment and if it is then how do brands maximise the impact beyond the money that is handed over in these deals the associations formed by brands and the authenticity of the placement are also in question as is the matter of whether the rising popularity of product placement is causing a dip in its credibility as a marketing channel find out more mark ritson – star wars is not the brand partnership you’re looking for product placement revenues in the us alone are set to grow  in  from more than bn last year according to pq media although no other market is close to matching it exploiting additional content analysis of films jurassic world and avengers age of ultron by amobee brand intelligence suggests that product placement can be effective – at least in creating awareness and engagement – particularly when the brand follows up with additional content “some of these projects can start two to three years before the film releases but it can help tell a brand story if done right” george clement chevrolet its data shows that ‘digital consumption’ increased for brands associated with these films the measure estimates audience interest based on how much related content is being viewed across the web mobile social and video channels the study shows that between may and june  of shaving foam brand barbasol’s digital consumption was related to jurassic world with  of it also mentioning the connection to the original  film jurassic park where it previously appeared barbasol has also more than doubled its digital footprint in the past month because of the association however lego is the brand most associated with the film not because of product placement but because of the jurassic world toy line it released barbasol and mercedesbenz which both did product placements come second and third amobee’s statistics also show that between march and june there was nearly five times as much avengersrelated digital consumption for gillette as barbasol achieved through jurassic world while gillette’s fusion proglide razor appeared in the latest avengers film briefly it is fair to assume most of this consumer activity was prompted by its parody press conference tv ad and youtube videos suggesting it had designed razors equipped with the same superpowers as the avengers characters httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpbjdgizwrlo the value of shareable content linked with product placement is being realised by some marketers general motor’s chevrolet brand for example filmed interviews with people who own its electric car volt at a prescreening of the tomorrowland film in which it appears hosted on the brand’s youtube channel general motor’s cadillac brand also ran a similar behindthescenes video with the cast of entourage and their thoughts on their ‘costar’ in the film the cadillac ciel “cinemagoers are emotionally engaged and ready to be told stories” says karen stacey ceo at digital cinema media “brands have an unrivalled opportunity to entertain and connect with them and can showcase their best brand stories alongside legendary filmmakers and characters” stacey believes there are several trends that are emerging that will get brands noticed in today’s fragmented media landscape first using effective advertising second building powerful emotional connections and third exploiting branded content see viewpoint below making product placements credible one sector that seems to have realised bigger potential in product placement in the past year is the automotive industry it is nothing new of course as james bond fans will know but cars are increasingly integrated into film storylines and the best branded content around films is getting sleeker and smarter not only drumming up interest in the film but also synchronising with key campaigns for brands find out more how heineken is using james bond to appeal to the “modern progressive male” this year’s releases will see mercedes race around with dinosaurs in jurassic world and bmw minis turn into ghosts from the arcade game pac man for adam sandler’s new film pixels – where villains from video games come to destroy earth for its tiein with tomorrowland chevrolet started talking to filmmakers in  as the technology and future theme were important to its ‘find new roads’ campaign – a concept that was part of the launch of a new global brand positioning “it’s great to be able to get in early to work with the filmmaker and find that natural connection within the story of the film” says george clement manager of branded entertainment at chevrolet “it’s important to get far upstream as you can some of these projects can start two to three years before the film releases but it can help tell a brand story if done right” the best branded content around films is getting sleeker and smarter and is synchronising with key brand campaignsthis does require involvement in the creative process particularly if the placement is arranged through a partnership model which the brand prefers clement says “we do have some say in that process but we are also respectful of the creative process” chevrolet has a long history of prominent product placement deals the bumblebee character in transformers is a chevrolet camero for example while tomorrowland is also not the first time the brand has teamed up with disney the manufacturer’s corvette tahoe silverado and impala models featured in disneyowned marvel studios’ captain america the winter soldier bridget mccarville branded entertainment manager at cadillac is not worried about the  other brands its going up against in the entourage film because it was “fortunate” that cadillac already featured with the escalade model in the hbo series “we loved that it took place in los angeles as la has a car culture” says mccarville “it was a great backdrop for us to feature” she adds “if you want to play in this space you have to realise that you are telling your brand story through an intermediary you have to trust their creative process you hand it over and put it in the world that they are creating so that the story comes through it connects and it’s organic” an ‘organic’ connection also saw volkswagen make an appearance in the recent film pitch perfect  about an american a capella singing group but the influence over the creative content was limited as the deal was not a paidfor partnership universal approached volkswagen with an opportunity to provide vehicles for the film and equipment for a scene where a rival german a capella group called das sound machine perform at an automotive show “there is great exposure for the brand” says jennifer clayton general manager for marketing at volkswagen “when we evaluate these types of partnerships we want to make sure it feels like a good fit is in line with our tonality and see whether there is an opportunity to do more with it” however she says “there is a fine line you walk” in product placement because there are risks in bombarding consumers with products “if you force your brand into a movie or piece of content where it doesn’t feel right consumers nine times out of  are going to call you out on that” she adds the film entourage features  brands including cadillacfor universal the appeal of the volkswagen product placement is cost savings on the staging equipment for the auto show scene vehicles for the film and the flexibility in creative choices as they do not have to treat the brand as a marketing partner because it is not a paidfor deal restrictive tv regulations the small screen is also getting savvy about the opportunities for brands and tv programming however in the uk there are tighter guidelines on what can be done in the tv format than on film which are set by telecoms regulator ofcom including what products can be used and where and how they can be placed programmes are also required to carry a product placement logo in the form of the letter p to inform viewers the programmemaker has been paid to include products its value however is under scrutiny as only four in  adult viewers are aware of product placement in television programmes and only  recognise that the ‘p’ symbol indicates product placement according to a study of  uk adults by ofcom product placement in tv is taking a similar road to film where brands are woven into storylines itv for example works with brands early in the process to “scope out opportunities on screen” explains katherine marlow senior product placement and branded content manager at itv she says brands need to “communicate objectives at the earliest stages” so it can work on finding relevant scenes and environments with production partners in the case of its visa contactless deal with coronation street and emmerdale the payments brand briefed itv in the last quarter of  and the broadcaster was able to agree a deal before filming started in december and transmission in february “under the ofcom guidelines all placements have to be editorially justified and cannot be unduly prominent” says marlow “product placement is the closest a brand can get to branded tv content and while the opportunity is hugely exciting we are always careful about the implementation above all we have to respect the viewers and maintain their trust and engagement” ofcom restrictions would also prevent overcrowding a programme with several brands so the bun fight between brands on the big screen does not happen on tv in the uk however marlow adds “some shows are big enough to sustain multiple pp deals such as the x factor which last year partnered with skype tresemmé and talktalk on screen” music is also an increasingly fertile ground for product placement a report published by the university of colorado in march found that references to products in lyrics had increased and that the practice of featuring brands in music videos was becoming more common partnering with lotus f will open up opportunities through tv coverage in emerging markets for pharrell williams’s brand i am otheras more artists look to create revenue in alternative ways considering the state of the music industry and the rise of streaming sites eating into recording revenues it is no wonder that more brands are paying to place products in songs and videos find out more why brands need to include music videos in their marketing mix musicians are also going the other way placing their own brands into televised entertainment “the truth is it’s about patronage rather than placement and finding two brands that work well together” says damon bryant executive creative director at lotus f team and partner at agency bacchus creative “quite often you will get a brand that will want to sign an artist just because they are big and they have a big song but you are paying a lot of money for a song to go on your ad campaign or into a feature film” he recently worked with singer and producer pharrell williams on placing his brand i am other which incorporates the star’s music film television apparel tech and multimedia into formula  bryant says pharrell “sees that tv audience and realises how he can push his music through” and also mentions that the star sees the merchandising partnerships art projects soundtracks made for the racetrack and opportunities in emerging markets that watch f including azerbaijan russia and mexico “that is a really exciting place where you are merging the music world tv and f” he adds bryant’s view on films reflects the same preference for “patronage not placement” he says “you have to engage with it in a beautiful way and make it part of the storytelling we all wear clothes wear a watch and drink – make it part of the story and that’s how it makes much more sense the brands have the money but don’t just slap them in for the sake of it because people get fed up of that” whether it is film music or tv brands that want to tap into the respective audiences of these genres will have to respect the creativity of each come early to the table to work alongside the creative and create the right interplay between the content on the screen and branded content surrounding it for brands looking to move into the content space they need to have an idea that’s pure and original while also understanding exactly who will watch it like it and share it advertisers must ensure they are using the right platforms available to them when launching their content while content will always be king brands need to start being braver bolder and more disruptive with their approach to ensure they are effectively engaging their target audience we believe that the rush to branded content that we are seeing today will see advertisers and agencies challenge themselves to make this content ever more cinematic we look at which brands sit in our world it’s being smart about it work out the demographic and find the brand that sits in the same world as you do that way you can lift each other because your audiences are similar consumers are looking for you to place your products in unique spots the key is where do we fit in and how does it work today’s consumer is savvy so if a brand can help enhance a story they will appreciate it hide

get the news sent straight to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close books   am et  updated apr   writers james bond and the perils of product placement by david gaughran for indiereadercom it’s one of the most recognizable quotes in the history of cinema “shaken but not stirred” the phrase perfectly encapsulated the nature of james bond and has since become synonymous with the suave british spy its first appearance was in ian fleming’s fourth bond novel diamonds are forever although bond himself didn’t utter the words until the sixth outing dr no – halfway through the muchloved series the movie franchise did a lot more to immortalize the phrase and it appeared from the very first installment dr no and in virtually every bond movie since with some notable exceptions it’s symbolic of james bond’s quintessential characteristics – sophistication – which explains why fans have reacted so angrily to reports that he will be trading his martini for a heineken in the upcoming skyfall this isn’t the first time that bond’s traditions have been tampered with his usual aston martin was swapped for a bmw in goldeneye presumably for a large check which caused a similar backlash critics argue that throughout the fleming novels numerous novelizations by other authors and twentytwo movies to date that have featured the spy there are only a few remaining signifiers that make bond who he is his code number  his looks and taste for amorous adventures and his sophistication and sense of style – of which the martini with its explicit instructions for preparation is a key part i’m sure the anger is compounded by the replacement beverage being something as unsophisticated as beer and something as universal and generic as heineken and i’m also confident that nobody is surprised to hear the release of the movie will be accompanied by a worldwide advertising campaign from heineken featuring bond swilling their lager aside from the muchderided temporary switch to bmw this is hardly the first instance of product or brand placement in bond movies since the very first installment in  bond movies have featured british airways panam perrier finlandia vodka smirnoff ford omega mattel calvin klein virgin atlantic revlon samsonite sony ericcson kodak and many more i’m sure ian fleming’s literary estate would defend the practice as monetizing something that was native to fleming’s writing anyway he often mentioned brands like cartier and received no compensation however fans would be justified in arguing that mentions of products have become increasingly shameless with a scene in casino royale namedropping omega attracting particular scorn product placement in movies and television has become so ubiquitous that it has led to widespread parody faux product placement the invention of fictional productsbrands such as kwikemart in the simpsons reverse placement the rebranding of reallife  stores as kwikemarts in  and product displacement where mercedezbenz asked the makers of slumdog millionaire to remove their iconic logo from scenes featuring their cars in slum settings such product placement isn’t as common in books but it has a long history when jules verne began serializing around the wold in eighty days in  transport and shipping companies lobbied to be mentioned it should be noted that verne claimed the novel was inspired by a thomas cook advertisement in a parisian newspaper however without a doubt the most shameless literary product placement was in a pulpy detective novel from  called never kill a client by brett halliday the book was part of a longrunning and hugely popular series featuring private detective mike shayne in one early scene in never kill a client shayne is on the scent of a case and boards a flight to los angeles taking a seat next to a passenger reading another of brett halliday’s books the narrator goes on to say “it wasn’t a rare occurrence for shayne to see some complete stranger reading one of halliday’s books with thirty million copies of them sold in soft cover editions it would have been queerer if you didn’t run into them now and then and shayne also knew that she woke to darkness had recently been reissued in a new cover and there were probably several hundred thousand copies of it in the hands of readers throughout the country” the conversation between shayne and the passenger about halliday’s oeuvre continues for another two pages such an aside is probably made easier by the fact that brett halliday was a penname the writer davis dresser was an interesting character who wore an eyepatch since a childhood accident with barbed wire aside from a voluminous writing output he was also a founding member of the mystery writers of america of which his wife fellow author helen mccloy later became the first female president there is no doubt that dresser’s tongue is firmly planted in his cheek in the above as fun is poked at several of his novels however it quite clearly shows the possibilities for advertisers to shoehorn their way into fictional narratives the advent of ebooks makes such marketing tieins a lot more attractive to brands as any author who has been interviewed for a newspaper will know a clickable link can make all the difference between a bump in sales and no effect whatsoever publishers and selfpublishers have been circling the idea of advertising in ebooks for some time straight advertising can be intrusive and can also provoke a negative reaction even if advertising in books is nothing new and has long been common in things like travel guides product placement is usually more subtle and allows marketers to tap into the emotional connection that people have with the writer’s characters the attraction of the idea is obvious it’s an additional revenue stream and potentially a very lucrative one while product placement in novels is unlikely to attract the kind of prices we are seeing in movies skyfall is aiming to bring in over m in product placement fees there is no doubt that the biggest selling books could command considerable prices for selfpublishers the attraction lies in monetizing free or cheap content after all a book could be permanently free if it was subsidized sufficiently by advertising or product placement fees however as the james bond outcry shows there are clear dangers here it seems there is a small step between getting paid for something you are doing anyway mentioning how much a character loves their converse and radically altering the characteristics of your hero or your plot to suit a corporate

moment in their lives — and the lives of their parents the children have the independence of choosing what they watch and the parents have the opportunity to stay in bed on a weekend morning this developmental stage has been in place for decades and i confess it’s one i secretly looked forward to and yet just  minutes into their morning viewing on a recent saturday my children shouted in annoyance they rousted me from bed complaining that something was wrong with the tv through the frenetic complaints i eventually realized that their program had been interrupted by ads this was a new experience for them they were used to watching on demand or recorded programs trying to explain to my children that there are advertising breaks so people can sell them things was a deflating experience i have since learned that i am not alone in this experience but that did not help me at the time their incomprehension was total my argument that ads are a minor but necessary annoyance was hardly persuasive while many have theorized about the decline of interruptionbased advertising i realized as i looked into my children’s faces that the end may be sooner than advertisers realize this is a fundamental shift not only for the tv channels which will have to completely rethink their revenue model but also for brands which find it incredibly and increasingly difficult to capture the attention of empowered impatient consumers an obvious solution is product placement a company paying for its product to be featured prominently in a film or television program as a form of advertising according to pqmedia the us product placement market grew by  in  to over  billion and is set to reach over  billion by  the trouble is that the huge success of product placement is causing a dip in its credibility and effectiveness as a marketing channel audiences are increasingly skeptical research by eva a van reijmersdal of the university of amsterdam suggests that when product placement becomes too prominent it affects attitudes negatively because viewers become aware of a deliberate selling attempt product placement can also lower audiences’ evaluations of the focal entertainment product the film or the show as recently demonstrated by andre marchand and colleagues and it’s particularly true when audiences like the film or show this leaves marketers scratching their heads if interruptionbased advertising is no longer an option and if traditional product placement is no longer the answer how can brands reach consumers while not offending their sense of empowerment and leveraging their desire for immediate gratification i have looked at brandtoconsumer interactions for the last  years and it is obvious that consumers are becoming more impatient more demanding and more marketingsavvy than ever before my research on product placement suggests two new routes that could leverage the evolution in consumer behavior the first is interactive product placement which is technologydriven and leverages the consumer desire for immediacy and relevance while watching a tv show the second is reverse product placement an innovative way of launching new brands that can protect the integrity of the show and respect the empowerment of the imaginative consumer interactive product placement the increasing ubiquity of digital communications technologies and the maturation of interactive video technologies mean that product placement could evolve from a simple promotional tool to a selling tool video technology now allows certain objects such as products to be “clickable” within the video this sometimes involves actual clicking such as when you’re watching a video on your laptop mobile device or smart tv it could also involve holding your phone’s camera up to a large screen and scanning an image of the thing being shown these interactive technologies allow the viewer to get more information on — or even buy — those brands if say james bond is wearing a shirt you like you will be able to buy it immediately this will have a significant impact on the design of future product and brand placement campaigns in addition to introducing a heretofore unknown flexibility to the design and timing of campaigns these technologies allow product placement campaigns to be targeted monitored and measured in real time as with other forms of internet advertising reverse product placement a number of fictional brands have been created in order to protect the integrity of the host show “red apple” cigarettes are a fictional brand of tobacco used by quentin tarantino in films such as pulp fiction kill bill and four rooms tarantino seeks to minimize relying on corporate sponsorship and to affirm the nonconformist nature of his movies the fictional brand conveys a “cool” image as it is associated with the characters and atmosphere of tarantino’s movies it cannot be purchased nor consumed — at least not as cigarettes — though the fake vintage ad here can be if these fictional brands possess brand equity is it possible to turn that equity into revenue the question is moot because it is already happening — and more regularly than you may think in  staples inc under license from nbc’s parent company comcast began to manufacture paper using the “dunder mifflin” brand name — the fictional paper company in the tv show the office avion tequila from the hit hbo show entourage has also been “defictionalized” and is now available as a real product in some of new york’s trendiest bars there’s no reason to think other brands won’t follow suit either licensing popular fictional brands from their creators or using popular shows to gauge consumer interest in their own forthcoming or proposed products fictional brands can be a method of protecting the integrity of the host show and introducing new brands but they also can provide an additional stream of revenue to the tv series and film producers seeking to make money in an era when interruptive advertising is dying reverse and interactive product placement could revolutionize the advertising industry both of those techniques further blur the lines between entertainment and advertisement and will accelerate the demise of interruptionbased advertising — much to the delight of our children laurent muzellec is an associate professor at trinity business school dublin where
