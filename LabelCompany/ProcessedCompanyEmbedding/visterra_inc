dengue vis for iga nephropathy collaborative programs vis for dengue vis our second product candidate vis is a monoclonal antibody or mab for the treatment of dengue dengue is a viral illness spread by aedes mosquitos that affects individuals of all ages the clinical features can range from fever headache and muscle aches to a severe lifethreatening infection characterized by uncontrolled bleeding and organ failure commonly known as dengue hemorrhagic fever dengue is caused by infection by any one of four genetically related but serologically distinct dengue viruses in preclinical studies vis was effective against all four serotypes of the dengue virus or denv we have also studied vis in several mouse models of dengue virus infection where we examined the ability of vis to reduce the circulating levels of the virus prevent enhanced disease and reduce thrombocytopenia or platelet loss we have observed in vivo activity by vis against all four dengue serotypes and vis has demonstrated consistent results in reducing the virus level across all of these mouse models furthermore we studied vis in a nonhuman primate nhp model of dengue virus infection where one serotype of the dengue virus was administered to nhps and  hours after detection of virus in circulation a single  mgkg dose of vis or control antibody was administered for nhps that received vis the blood levels of virus were undetectable after administration as compared to the nhps that received the control antibody and demonstrated circulating virus for approximately six days with peak levels of approximately  to  plaque forming units or infectious particles per milliliter of blood in august  we entered into an agreement with the serum institute of india private limited or siipl pursuant to which siipl will be responsible for developing manufacturing obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing vis in india pakistan bangladesh nepal bhutan maldives and sri lanka territories which we refer to collectively as the indian subcontinent we received an upfront payment from siipl and could receive development and if approved commercial milestone payments and royalties of net sales of vis in the indian subcontinent we retain the rights to commercialize vis outside the indian subcontinent we expect that phase  clinical trials of vis will be initiated by siipl in the first half of  based on the clinical data generated in our collaboration with siipl we will evaluate whether additional clinical trials are warranted andor needed to support regulatory approval of vis outside the indian subcontinent if the results of the ongoing and planned clinical trials of vis are successful we expect the submission of applications for marketing approval for vis for the treatment of dengue initially in the indian subcontinent and later in other countries where dengue is prevalent based on the need to conduct additional clinical trials and the regulatory approval requirements we intend to fund our vis development with third party financing and will continue to explore additional partnering opportunities to advance the development of vis for the treatment of dengue on a global basis outside of the indian subcontinent about dengue dengue is a viral illness spread by aedes mosquitos that affects individuals of all ages the clinical features can range from fever headache and muscle aches to a severe lifethreatening infection characterized by uncontrolled bleeding and organ failure commonly known as dengue hemorrhagic fever it is a growing global health problem and is the most common mosquitoborne disease in the world dengue is caused by infection by any one of the four genetically related but serologically distinct dengue viruses referred to as denv denv denv and denv according to an article published in  in a peerreviewed scientific journal over  million denv infections occur worldwide each year and approximately  million people manifest clinical disease resulting in approximately  deaths the increasing incidence and geographical spread of the disease has been linked to human population growth and urbanization expanded travel increasing globalization of the world economy and lack of effective mosquito control dengue is an acute disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild febrile illness to lifethreatening hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome denv infects cells of the human immune system leading to symptoms that include high fever severe headache eye pain joint pain muscle and bone pain rash and mild bleeding in severe cases plasma leaks out of the circulatory system and collects in body cavities a condition that can be fatal there is no specific treatment for dengue and prevention depends solely on effective mosquito control measures the global economic burden from dengue is estimated at approximately  billion annually as of  contact    sitemap visterra inc  one kendall square

influenza a vis our lead product candidate vis is a monoclonal antibody or mab that we have designed and engineered to target all known strains of influenza a and is being developed to treat hospitalized patients with influenza a vis is designed to terminate the viral replication cycle and is directed against a hierotope on hemagglutinin which is a surface protein of influenza viruses used for binding and entry into cells in our phase a challenge study of vis healthy subjects were inoculated with a pandemic hn strain of the influenza a virus and randomized to receive either a single treatment of vis or placebo  hours following infection this study achieved with statistical significance its primary endpoint of a median reduction in the level of virus in the nasal secretions over the course of the illness at a prespecified interim analysis following enrollment of  of a planned  healthy subjects we observed a  reduction in the level of virus in the nasal secretions in the vis group and as a result stopped the efficacy portion of the trial early the median time period for resolution of symptoms was two days shorter for the vis treatment group as compared to the placebo group there were no serious adverse events in the trial and vis was generally well tolerated with a pretreatment regimen containing generic antihistamines and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or nsaids we are conducting a global phase a clinical trial in approximately  ambulatory patients diagnosed with influenza a and plan to initiate a global phase b clinical trial in the second half of  in approximately  hospitalized patients diagnosed with influenza a who require oxygen support assuming positive results following the phase b clinical trial we plan to meet with the us food and drug administration or the fda and the european medicines agency or ema to discuss our phase  program and the possibility of one pivotal phase  clinical trial being sufficient to support a biological license application or bla in the united states and a marketing authorization application in the european union for vis for the treatment of hospitalized patients with influenza a we have been awarded a contract from the us biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda an agency of the us government’s department of health and human services that includes a fortymonth base period with committed funding of  million for the development of vis and options that if exercised in full by barda would extend the contract to sixty months and increase the total funding for the development of vis to  million if barda exercises all of its options under the terms of the contract we expect barda will reimburse us for a large portion of the development costs for vis for the treatment of influenza a under our contract with barda we retain the commercial rights to vis but have granted to the us government a nonexclusive worldwide royaltyfree license to practice or have practiced any patent on an invention that is conceived or first reduced to practice under the contract about influenza influenza is an infectious disease that causes illness in humans worldwide with symptoms that range in severity from mild to lifethreatening the majority of seasonal influenza infections result in mild illness with symptoms that include fever headache fatigue cough and sore throat some infections however result in severe disease which can involve rapidly progressive pneumonia respiratory failure and in some cases death severe disease is more commonly observed in highrisk groups including infants pregnant women the elderly individuals with underlying medical conditions such as chronic heart and lung disease and patients with disease or treatmentrelated immunosuppression each year human influenza a viruses cause epidemics which are sudden outbreaks that spread rapidly and affect many people at the same time with influenza a being responsible for the majority of such outbreaks influenza a viruses are categorized into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n there are  different hemagglutinin subtypes which are designated by the abbreviations h through h and  different neuraminidase subtypes which are designated by the abbreviations n through n immunity to influenza acquired from vaccination or previous natural exposure is usually specific to the strain of the virus and declines over time leading to the need for repeated annual vaccination according to the cdc approximately  million people suffer from influenza infections in the united states each year resulting in as many as  hospitalizations and as many as  deaths the who reports that globally there are as many as five million severe influenza cases annually leading to as many as  deaths our analysis of a large database of hospitalizations in the united states showed that  of hospitalized influenza patients require a supplemental oxygen support or positive pressure ventilator support during their hospitalization this analysis also showed that the average length of hospital stay for patients was seven days and the average charge per hospital day was approximately  for influenza patients requiring ventilator support and approximately  for influenza patients who did not require ventilator support in addition to seasonal infections epidemics that spread across countries and continents or pandemics are caused by influenza strains that have high humantohuman transmission and if the strain causes severe disease can lead to a high mortality rate an hn strain of the influenza a virus caused the  spanish influenza pandemic which is estimated to have resulted in approximately  million deaths worldwide evolving avian influenza or bird flu viruses such as hn and hn which have a high associated mortality rate and the potential to infect and readily transmit in humans pose a major health risk the avian hn influenza strains that emerged in  have mortality rates as high as  in infected individuals as of  contact    sitemap visterra inc  one kendall square suite b  cambridge ma       visterra inc all
