telmexs control of  of the mexican landline telephone market slims wealth is the equivalent of roughly  of mexicos annual economic output telmex of which  is owned by slim and his family charges among the highest usage fees in the world according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development the average mexican spends  pesos per day on slims goods and services for a total of roughly us million a day and the federal telecommunications institute a new mexican government antimonopoly watchdog said in april  that slims telecom businesses are monopolies slims business presence in
