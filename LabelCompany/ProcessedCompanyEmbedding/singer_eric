drumming together on stages all over the world pearl and kiss drummer eric singer recently collaborated to create a new limited edition signature drum with a nod to one of the great snares of pearl’s past “i collect classic and vintage pearl drums” says eric “i love the sound and feel of the original jupiter chrome‐over‐brass models from the ’s and really wanted to explore that sound with an updated feel” the result is eric’s new th anniversary limited edition signature snare released on the heels of singer and pearl’s successful charity drum auction for the lifeline charter school in  eric’s new snare begins with a dual‐beaded jupiter‐style mm chrome‐plated brass shell in contrast to the jupiter’s original parallel action strainer eric’s limited signature update features pearl’s compact click‐lock throw‐off for smooth sensitive response each drum is signed by eric and assures tuning accuracy with pearl’s low‐contact cl bridge lugs similar to last year’s auction drum all artist royalties from the sale of eric’s th anniversary limited snare will benefit school music and arts programs at the lifeline education charter school in compton ca “it has been an honor and pleasure to play pearl drums for over  years and counting” singer says “they have truly given me the best reason to play drums” pearl ″x″ limited edition eric singer snare sku esascadd to
