generate growth nielsen cfo jamere jackson jamere jackson jamere jackson cfo of nielsen holdings plc has three shortterm priorities for his finance team focus on allocating resources to deliver on strategic objectives become more digitally enabled to drive efficiencies and develop into growth leaders “having a technical mastery is table stakes for members of the nielsen finance team” says mr jackson who took over as cfo at the consumer measurement and analytics company two years ago “i want people who are focused on growing the business in addition to handling their typical fiduciary responsibilities” he adds mr jackson discusses how the finance team helps drive business performance the strategic role he plays in investor and board relations and how lessons from his time as a division i college athlete sharpened his leadership skills among other issues q how does the finance organization partner with the business to drive performance jamere jackson we’re at the table from the start helping the businesses think through strategic alternatives and growth opportunities and making sure that as we allocate resources we have a view of business priorities i personally spend time with our operations team on nielsen’s current growth strategy as well as growth over the next three five and  years i also play an active role in what our ceo mitch barns calls “center edge balance” which is maintaining equilibrium between what happens at the center of our company—the csuite and other corporate functions—and what happens at the edge of our company—the business units in the field the goal is to strike the appropriate balance between ideas strategy execution and tactics that requires having finance business partners that are in the plus countries where we operate to help business teams execute on strategy often finance business partners are the people we’ve hired locally typically a division cfo or a financial analyst who is intimately familiar with our business in a specific country and understands local business practices and growth opportunities we want them to be fullfledged business partners and not just focused on accounting reporting controllership and compliance we want them to be involved in corporate and commercial strategy such as how we price our products and allocate capital and resources to the business units q what role do you play in investment and acquisition decisions particularly in light of the pressures of a quickly evolving market jamere jackson one of my key roles as chief financial officer is to help manage capital allocation our capital allocation strategy is based on growing our business and returning cash to shareholders in an investorfriendly way the way you earn the ability to spend capital is demonstrating that you’re going to deliver an acceptable return on that investment in addition as part of the leadership team finance often has to make informed estimates about our future and generating returns that’s why it’s so important to be a business partner which allows finance to spend time with the operating teams and clients and with the marketplace so we understand where the industry is headed we don’t always operate with perfect information but the more engaged we are with internal and external operations the better chance we have of capital making the right decisions to invest capital in the right places q how do you balance the shorterterm view that is typically taken by investors and analysts in the united states with the longerterm view that stakeholders outside the us might take jamere jackson the only way that i can convince an investor that i’m going to deliver in the long term is by putting numbers on the scoreboard in the short term that gives them some confidence that i’ll be able to achieve longterm objectives we can’t be conflicted about the notion of whether decisions are good for the short or longterm they have to be good for both i’ll give you an example we invested in a technology platform for digital ad ratings in the  timeframe when the market was very fragmented and there wasn’t a big business opportunity that we could clearly identify but we were convinced that media fragmentation was going to hit the industry in a big way and digital viewing was going to accelerate in the future we had to stay focused on our strategy to measure the consumer rather than a particular distribution channel we placed a bet well ahead of the market opportunity materializing and we did that with conviction five years later the opportunity is here and we’re executing on it effectively in the marketplace another example is what we’ve done in emerging markets in light of rising populations emerging middle classes and urbanization we doubled down on investments in emerging economies ahead of opportunities and reduced our operating margins as a total company for a period of about three years we explained to investors that the payoff would be future growth opportunities the strategy required discipline stamina and the courage to make those kinds of decisions through market cycles from my view it was the right longterm move the last seven quarters we’ve seen margins come back and our businesses in emerging markets grow by  to  q while nielsen is known for its ratings business what is your role in educating investors about its information and analytics capabilities jamere jackson i spend time on the road with investors at least twice a quarter where i’m talking about the latest financial results and spreading the gospel about what we are and what we aspire to be in the future also we’ve made a concerted effort over the last couple of years to have other voices tell that story those voices come from our product leadership group and technology operations teams it’s important to allow our key external stakeholders and shareholders to see the depth and breadth of the talent inside nielsen when investors get to see that next tier of leaders talking about where nielsen is and where we’re going it gives them confidence in the things that the ceo and i have been saying there’s no better way to illustrate the bench strength of a company than putting rising leaders in front of investors and other stakeholders allowing them to go into depth about our strategy products and emerging industry trends complements the financial story that’s part of our investor roadshows q how do you work with the board jamere jackson while i report the financial results i also take the lead in helping the board understand the strategic choices we’re making what they mean for nielsen financially and the marketplace implications the ceo and i collaborate to develop the board agenda then i work with individual business leaders to prepare them for conversations with the board coaching them on the material and the level of conversation so information is communicated in a way that’s clear crisp and concise i also focus on what i call “winning in the offseason” i build relationships with individual directors outside the boardroom to discuss what we’re working on why we’re making certain choices and getting counsel from them on how to think about creating a fastergrowing highermargin company q what lessons from the hardwood as captain of notre dame’s basketball team have you brought to your business career

strengths and sharing best practices across our organization and the finance function to be successful the third lesson is getting to know the people on your team i spend a lot of time with our senior leadership and invest time getting to know individuals who work deep within our organization we have employee resource groups focused on diversity and inclusion and i’m a champion for many of those efforts i also spend time with our finance councils where i bring our top finance leaders together with talent two three or four levels below the cfo level so they have an opportunity to meet in person and discuss business i also have cfo dinners quarterly to bring top talent into our headquarters to expose them to how things work at the corporate level and to hear from them about what’s going on in the field the final lesson is to have fun when you’re playing sports and particularly if you’re winning you’re having fun i want our teams to enjoy helping our clients win in the
