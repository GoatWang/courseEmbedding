pierce david pierce gear date of publication   time of publication  am  am review google pixel googles new phone the pixelkelsey mcclellan for wired i write about gadgets which means everyone asks me what laptop or dishwasher or whatever to buy i struggle with this because the answer often starts with “it depends” unless you ask about a phone in that case i usually say get an iphone don’t get me wrong i love android but the phones can be… frustrating clever features too often seem overwrought or poorly designed or they’re buried beneath  verizon apps on the homescreen the iphone is the default phone the one you buy when you want a phone not a project the google pixel changes that it offers the look and competence of an iphone with a truly great camera and loads of innovative software and services it changes my answer to the question i hear most often what phone should you get you should get a pixel talk to me google’s new phone arrives thursday starting at  for the pixel and  for the pixel xl you can get it in blue black or silver with  or  gigs of storage from google or from verizon you should buy it directly from google and soon most models already are backordered not long after i got my pixel xl i flew to colombia for a week’s vacation it was a very googley getaway i had a project fi sim card i kept my itinerary in google trips and given what verizon charges for international data on my iphone  i relied entirely upon the pixel because project fi gives standard rates in most countries recommends  google pixel  learn how we rate wired google assistant is the first voice assistant that really works you cant take a bad picture with the pixel so what if it looks like the iphone the iphone looks great and so does the pixel tired every phone should be waterproof and this one isnt good as it is assistants hardly flawless buy it now     google how we rate a complete failure in every way sad really serious flaws proceed with caution downsides outweigh upsides recommended with reservations solid with some issues very good but not quite great excellent with room to kvetch nearly flawless metaphysical perfection the trip provided a perfect way of testing the limits of google assistant pixel’s distinguishing feature if the pixel is google’s iphone assistant is its soupedup siri longpress the onscreen home button or say “ok google” and ask it anything how many dollars is  colombian pesos how hot is it in the tatacoa desert where can i find coffee assistant was my guide translator and researcher it knew where i needed to go how to get there and when to leave it told me about simón bolívar and knew enough about current events to explain the recent protests in the plaza that bears his name assistant does share common stumbling blocks with siri and amazon’s alexa it likes to answer easy questions by showing web results and it speaks at unexpected often jarring moments “here are your events” is not a useful thing to yell when asked about my calendar i wish i could type questions into the popup prompt instead of saying everything aloud like a tourist or opening an app like a nerd in theory google’s deep knowledge of you and your life sets assistant apart but that didn’t always pan out assistant has all the information needed to handle me saying “wake me up  minutes before i need to leave for the airport” but it failed to do so on a later attempt it set the alarm for almost seven hours before my flight there’s traffic in bogotá but not that much traffic still assistant is the best voice assistant yet—though not as far ahead as advertised its lead is the difference between being surprised when siri works and being surprised when assistant doesn’t its speechtotext recognition is almost perfect even when i butchered villa de leyva i don’t open as many apps anymore i tell google to do stuff for me the biggest challenge to enjoying assistant has been my own inertia assistant makes everything faster and easier if you remember to use it kelsey mcclellan for wired the best camera you have with you i spent one night in the tatacoa desert at a small hotel miles from the nearest town returning to civilization our taxi driver hermes took us on a tour of photofriendly spots he’d lead us down some tiny side road point to a big rock or cool crevice and with two hands gesture for me to hand him my phone so he could take a picture i also took hundreds of megapixel photos and k videos and more selfies than i’m proud of using the megapixel front cam for the record i didn’t bring the selfie stick i just used it in every case the colors dynamic range and sharpness matched or exceeded every phone i’ve used you don’t get the cool zoom or softfocus features of the iphone  plus but you get killer photos nonetheless everything automatically goes into google photos where the pixel gets you unlimited free storage for fullresolution video and stills in fact the real difference between the pixel and the iphone’s camera is a matter of approach as much as of execution the iphone faithfully reproduces the exact light of the image even when it’s boring or flat or dark the pixel like most android phones subtly enhances everything to make it a little brighter a little more vibrant you can watch the automatic hdr processing in real time if you open a photo right after shooting most of the time the pixel takes a nicer photo than you’d expect some photographers prefer to make those creative decisions but i like that my photos look awesome on instagram no filters necessary i’ve never been more confident shooting with my smartphone slide   of  caption david pierce slide   of  caption david pierce slide   of  caption david pierce slide   of  caption david pierce slide   of  caption david

looks like an iphone and that’s totally ok my review unit is the inch pixel xl a teensy bit smaller in my hand than the iphone  plus but so similar that i confuse the two the beveled aluminum body is a little sharper and harder than the round smooth iphone but feels solid and nice to hold the pixel’s only standout hardware features are the large round rear fingerprint reader and the glass panel that takes up about a third of the back i’m of two minds about the fingerprint reader placement i love how easy it is to turn the phone on and unlock it with my index finger while sliding it out of my pants but it’s annoying to have to pick it up every time unless i want to manually enter the passcode the glass panel feels sort of pointless it is at least functionally i’m told it’s different for different’s sake i prefer the iphone’s unified monolithic feel you know what sucks about the pixel it’s not waterproof every phone should be waterproof beyond that my hardware complaints are nitpicky i think it’s dumb to only have one speaker and the headphone jack should be on the bottom edge but none of this matters to most people specswise it’s exactly what a phone this expensive should be and as fast as you’d expect it’s the first daydreamready phone prepared to handle google’s new vr platform but i haven’t tested that yet i suspect it’ll look better on the pixel xl’s inch × display rather than the pixel’s inch p screen though the battery on the pixel xl always survived a day of travel mapping menu translating and election news searching with  to  percent left when i went to bed i haven’t tried the pixel but i suspect that its lowerres screen means it should last about as long despite having a smaller battery otherwise the two devices are identical google clearly wanted to make something highend yet widely appealing it isn’t going after someone who loves a good stylus or who wants funky design touches or niche productivity features it’s just a really really good smartphone kelsey mcclellan for wired grownup android the pixel continues the tradition established by google’s discontinued nexus line of being the only way to enjoy the best of android in fact it’s even more extreme than that assistant is exclusive to the pixel for the foreseeable future it’s a shame because the pixel addresses almost all of the annoying little things about android for example until now app icons were different sizes which is a great litmus test for whether you’re a little ocd guilty on the pixel they’re uniform and most of them are round it feels carefully considered in a way android rarely does an unobtrusive icon that leads you into the google now stream replaces the giant google search bar you can swipe up from the bottom of the homescreen to access apps instead of tapping the fourdot button some people never even discover the software even uses app shortcuts which are basically like d touch for android—hardly any apps use it so far but i hope that changes pixel up close what makes the pixel’s camera so good software and lasers google pixel upends the android universe all that new google hardware it’s a trojan horse for ai daydream view is google’s plushy vr headset for the masses i’ve always loved android because it felt so much more alive and connected than ios the sharing menus are smarter and more prominent apps refresh in the background so they’re always up to date and widgets and notifications are useful and interactive but ios was always so much simpler with shallower learning curves it’s dictatorial but painless the pixel’s software doesn’t totally close that gap it’s still too easy to clutter your homescreens with multiple versions of the same icon and it’s still too hard to find cool features like the thing where you can swipe down on the fingerprint reader to see your notification shade but the pixel is the most coherent and cohesive android ever i’ve always been an iphone guy honestly i’ve used just about every flagship android phone ever made and always returned to apple that’s partly because i bought an iphone s in  and signed up for imessage and leaving imessage is a monumental pain in the ass but mostly i liked having a phone i didn’t have to think about the iphone always offers great hardware a good camera fantastic apps and data security i don’t want to worry about my phone or spend my time tinkering with it my phone’s too important to risk any extra effort or worse unreliability but i’m switching for real i’m turning off imessage rebuying apps and warning friends that i probably won’t get their texts for a few days i am a little worried about google’s longterm commitment to this new hardware push and the customer support that comes with it given its propensity for killing products that don’t get billions of users but i’m totally in love with the pixel i love this camera i love google assistant i love that i’ll get to use it with a comfy vr headset i love that i finally get a version of android that is both powerful and attractive i love that there’s a kickass android phone that probably doesn’t explode the immediate joke everyone including me made on twitter after the pixel launch was that google made an iphone well that’s true as it turns out an iphone running android is exactly what i’ve been waiting for update a few months later i recently had to switch back to the iphone because i needed a way to betatest apps for work and most companies only do their betas on ios tech writer problems i miss the pixel like crazy it took a few days to figure out how to make the most of android which is subtly but materially different from ios instead of relying on apps’ unread badges to tell you what’s new you keep notifications around until you’ve dealt with them in android anything you need is always a swipe down and your home screen should be more than just a bunch of app icons the change was harder than i thought but worth it there are still two places the iphone wins one is the apps which are generally both more updated and just better on ios than on android apple’s put a lot of time into developing this ecosystem and it shows the other is the accessories trying to find a decent pixel dock for my nightstand a case or anything else was a giant pain ultimately i think the pixel’s success will inspire more people to make accessories just as they have with samsung devices but if you’re an accessorizer the iphone is still unbeatable still i’m convinced the pixel’s the phone to buy right now over the last few months i’ve heard from a lot of people who read this review and bought a pixel they all told me it was my fault if they hated it that i’d owe them the  or whatever they spent nobody’s come back collecting yet related video business meet the
