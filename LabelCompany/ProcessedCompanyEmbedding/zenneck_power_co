wave at an airsilver interface the zenneck wave zenneck surface wave or sommerfeldzenneck surface wave is an inhomogeneous or nonuniform electromagnetic plane wave incident at the complex brewster angle onto a planar or spherical boundary interface between two homogeneous media having different dielectric constantsp  the zenneck wave propagates parallel to the interface and decays exponentially vertical to it a property known as evanescence it exists under the condition that the permittivity of one of the materials forming the interface is negative while the other one is positive as for example the interface between air and a lossy conducting medium such as the terrestrial transmission line below the plasma frequency arising from original analysis by arnold sommerfeld and jonathan

newsletter  wholesale book list  contact us  reference section  search  site map newsletter rediscovering the zenneck surface wave article list from feed line no  rediscovering the zenneck surface wave by gary peterson in  while speaking of his system for global transmission tesla cited the analysis of mathematician arnold n sommerfeld as verification of his explanations of observed radio phenomena  tesla was referring to his wireless system in which he claimed  to  of the electrical energy was manifested at the transmitters output as current waves with the remainder existing as dissipating electromagnetic radiation see antenna theory  in  another investigator by the name of johann zenneck while working to explain marconis transoceanic results showed that a unique type of surface wave could travel along the interface between the ground and the air  in the words of james corum the distinguishing feature of the zenneck wave was that the propagating energy didnt spread like radiation but was concentrated near the guiding surface  sommerfeld had shown that an electromagnetic wave could be guided along a wire of finite conductivity and zenneck conceived that the earths surface would perform in a manner similar to a single conducting wire see operating principles of the wardenclyffe apparatus in commenting on sommerfelds analysis of the surface wave james r wait states that the field amplitude varies inversely as the square root of the horizontal distance from the source     its interesting to note that sommerfeld made a point of distinguishing between the electrodynamic surface wave and its hertzian counterpart the space wave believing that both components could be present in varying proportion in the wave complex  it was teslas assertion that the exact composition of the emissions was dependent upon the design of the transmitter launching structure geometry for zenneck wave propagation according to james corums mathematical analysis of the zenneck wave the resulting wave is a surface guided single conductor transmission line mode which attenuates exponentially along the guide     there is no inverse square spreading or diffraction as with hertzian waves     with appropriate constitutive parameters a pure zenneck wave would seem to hold out the promise of guided propagation with no radiation field to waste energy as the study of radio propagation progressed and certain mathematical analyses excluded it some question as to the existence of zenneck surface waves began to develop  in  limited support was given to these doubts after tests showed simple antennas driven at  mhz produced  times lower field strength than predicted  more recent investigations show evidence that zenneck waves can indeed be generated  the lower the frequency the lower are the propagation losses  it is also apparent that they are not a major contributor to the field produced by an electric dipole or a quarter wave radiator however they might be excited by an energetic quarter wave resonator  to quote hill and wait as it turns out the zenneck wave is generally difficult to excite with a realistic source because it has a rather slow decay with height above the earths surface  but there is still an open question whether other types of sources may not be more favorable    an infinite vertical aperture with height variation corresponding to that of the zenneck wave will excite only the zenneck surface wave with no radiation field    hill d and jr wait excitation of the zenneck surface wave by a vertical aperture radio science vol  no  novemberdecember  pp  and to once again quote dr corum the  analysis provided by hill and wait examined the fields produced by a vertical sheet of horizontally directed magnetic current with an exponential variation in an infinite zenneck aperture    the analysis    showed that this field has no intrinsic merit at  to  mhz and we certainly agree  one wonders however and this is pure conjecture at this point if the disposition of teslas colorado springs high voltage  mv vlf resonator did in fact possess an effective vertical distribution of magnetic current which could launch a similar zenneck surface wave    plots of field strength vs frequency indicate that a zenneck wave propagates best at elf and vlf frequencies up to about  khz and begins to lose its advantage as frequency rises above this point predicted zenneck wave field strength decrease for aroundtheworld propagation as a function of frequency in khz the complex longitudinal propagation phase constant along the earths surface for the zenneck surface wave the zenneck surface wave vs the norton surface wave a wave dipole antenna in free spacethe hertz antennaapproaches an ideal source of electromagnetic radiation emitted in the form of space waves  these space waves can reach the receiver either by skywave propagation or by groundwave propagation the latter being the portion of the radiated space wave that propagates close to the earths surface  the ground wave has both directwave and groundreflected components and under certain conditions a tropospheric ducting component  the directwave is limited only by the distance to the horizon from the transmitter plus a small distance added by atmospheric diffraction around the curvature of the earth  the groundreflected portion of the radiated wave reaches the receiving antenna after being reflected from the earths surface there is also an induced groundhugging surfacewave component known as the norton surface wave  this wave is the result of electrical currents induced in the ground by refraction of a portion of the reflectedwave component at the earthatmosphere interface  upon reflection from the earths surface the reflected wave undergoes a deg phase reversal  when both transmitting and receiving antennas are on or close to the ground and the distance between them becomes great the direct and reflected components tend to cancel out and the resulting field intensity is principally that of this surface wave  because part of its energy is absorbed by the ground the electrical intensity of the surface wave is attenuated at a much greater rate than inversely as the distance  it is the conductivity of the underlying terrain that determines the attenuation of the surfacewave field intensity as a function of distance  the ground currents of a vertically polarized surface wave do not shortcircuit a given electric field but rather serve to restore part of the used energy to the following field  the better the conducting surface layer the more energy returned and the less energy absorbed antennas and radio propagation tm  dept of the army feb  pp  it is useful here to consider two additional forms of wireless telecommunications antennas or launching structures the marconi antenna a vertical wave monopole antenna element and the tesla antenna a vertical high aspectratio wave helical resonator with large capacitive top loading and small overall height compared to the electrical  wavelength  in both cases the structure is base fed and a ground connection is used the marconi antenna is a modified wave hertz antenna adapted to the realworld conditions encountered in the construction of medium and low frequency transmitters  these adaptations are imposed by the wavelength involved and the resulting physical dimensions required of the antenna  the dipole antenna is modified in that its lower half  wavelength long exists only as a mirror image of its upper counterpart  the resulting wave vertical monopole antenna takes advantage of the fact that at lower frequencies the ground acts as a mirror for the radiated energy  the ground reflects a large amount of the energy that is radiated downward from the antenna mounted over it  in the physical construction of the ground connection is important to have as high a conductivity as possible   the object is to provide the best possible reflecting surface for the energy radiated downward from the antenna  the ground consists of a number of bare conductors arranged radially and connected  wavelength long buried a short distance beneath the earths surface  in practice these conductors may act as part of the reflecting surface as well as making the connection to ground itself   an alternative type of ground is the counterpoise   it is a wire structure erected a short distance above the ground and insulated from the ground  the counterpoise operates by virtue of its capacitance to the ground   not unlike the hertz antenna the marconi antenna is a source electromagnetic radiation in the form of space wavesthe tesla antenna is a form of wireless antenna or wave launching structure developed by tesla in which the transmitted energy propagates or is carried to the receiver by a combination of electrical current flowing through the earth electrostatic induction and electrical conduction through plasma with an embedded magnetic field  of course it is also part of an electric dipole consisting of the elevated capacitance the helical resonator and master oscillator plus connections and the earth itself  the aboveground structure is not intended as a source of electromagnetic radiation rather it is designed to minimize the production of electromagnetic radiation  the principle that the ground acts as a mirror which reflects electromagnetic energy radiated downward by the antenna mounted over it is not applicable in operation the tesla launching structure induces an electrical current in the earth between the transmitting and receiving stations along with an associated surface wave that propagate the transmitted energy  a conducting path is also establish through the rarified upper level atmosphere between the transmitting and receiving stations elevated high voltage terminals leading tesla to coin the term disturbed charge of ground and air method  he stated that this method involves electrical conduction and that energy escapes from the system in the form of electromagnetic radiation  the conducting media are the earth and the atmosphere above  miles elevation  while the region from  miles up to the ionosphere is not an ohmic conductor the density or pressure is sufficiently reduced to so that according to teslas theory the atmospheres insulating properties can be easily impaired allowing an electric current to flow  his theory further suggests that the conducting region is developed through the process of atmospheric ionization shifting the effected portions thereof to a plasma state  a magnetic field is developed by each plants helical resonator meaning that an embedded magnetic field is also involved  the atmosphere below  miles is also viewed as a propagating medium for a portion of the above ground circuit and being an insulating medium electrostatic induction or displacement current would be involved rather than true electrical conduction  tesla felt that with a sufficiently high electrical potential on the elevated terminal the practical limitation imposed upon its height could be overcome  he anticipated that a highly energetic transmitter would charge the elevated terminal to the point where the atmosphere around and above it would break down and become ionized leading to a flow of true conduction currents between the two terminals through the troposphere path connectionnow sommerfeld described an electrodynamic wave that is guided along a wire of finite conductivity and zenneck expanded upon this description asserting that the earths surface performs in a manner similar to a conducting wire  and while the norton surface wave is the result of electrical currents induced in the ground by refraction of a portion of the reflectedwave component of the groundwave at the earthatmosphere interface the surface wave associated with teslas apparatus is the result of electrical ground currents flowing between two discrete points on the earths surface  unlike the lossy norton surfacewave that is excited by a conventional am radio transmitter it would seem that teslas surface wave would not diminish quite as significantly as the distance from the source facility increases  see a comparison of the tesla and marconi lf wireless systemsthis piece is derived from the zenneck surface wave appendix ii of the paper entitled nikola tesla lightning observations and stationary waves by k l corum and j f corum phd  presented at the  colorado springs tesla symposium  this and other papers are available through
