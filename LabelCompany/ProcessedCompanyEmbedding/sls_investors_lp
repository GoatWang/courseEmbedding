degree of risk you should consider the following risk factors carefully before deciding to purchase shares of our common stock risks related to our business we have incurred significant losses  if we are unable to improve our financial performance the price of our common stock will suffer      we incurred losses of  and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively although we have undertaken aggressive efforts to improve our profitability and increase our cash flows it is possible that the steps we have taken will not be successful or of sufficient impact for us to achieve an acceptable level of profitability or positive cash flow if we fail to do so the price of our common stock will suffer we expect our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter and as a result we may not meet the expectations of our investors and stock analysts which could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline      our revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations may be misleading you should not rely upon the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance our revenue and operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters our failure to meet these expectations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline      our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary depending on a number of factors including      the type timing and size of orders and shipments for major customers        demand for and acceptance of our new product offerings and returns or warranty costs from new product failures that exceed our established reserves        delays in the implementation and delivery of our products and services which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenue        writeoffs of receivables in excess of reserves        variations in product mix and margins during any period        inventory obsolescence    table of contents      development of new relationships and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers and strategic partners        manufacturing or production difficulties        deferral of customer contracts in anticipation of product or service enhancements        foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations        availability of financing and        industry and economic conditions including competition industry standards product certification requirements trade restrictions and other regulations the loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits      we have derived and believe that we may continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large customers for the fiscal year ended december   our two largest customers accounted for  of our net revenue and our five largest customers accounted for  of our net revenue as of december   three customers represented  or  million of our total backlog of  million our customers may buy less of our products or services depending on their own technological developments and internal budget cycles a major customer in one year may not purchase any of our products or services in another year which may negatively affect our financial performance our products may contain defects that may be difficult or even impossible to correct product defects could result in sales delays lost sales delays in our collection of receivables and claims against us      we offer technically complex products which when first introduced or released in new versions may contain software or hardware defects that are difficult to detect and correct the existence of defects and delays in correcting them could result in negative consequences including the following      delays in shipping products        loss of market acceptance for our products        product returns        additional warranty expenses        diversion of resources from product development        loss of credibility with distributors and customers and        lost sales      even though we test all of our products defects may continue to be identified after products are shipped in past periods we have experienced various issues in connection with product launches including the need to rework these products and stabilize product designs correcting defects can be a timeconsuming and difficult task software errors may take several months to correct and hardware errors may take longer such issues may result in sales delays delays in the collection of receivables and cancellation of orders which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and future business    table of contents we may accumulate excess or obsolete inventory that could result in unanticipated price reductions and write downs and adversely affect our financial condition      managing the proper inventory levels for components and finished products is challenging in formulating our product offerings we have focused our efforts on providing to our customers products with greater capacity and functionality which requires us to develop and incorporate the most current technologies in our products this approach tends to increase the risk of obsolescence for products and components we hold in inventory and may compound the difficulties posed by other factors that affect our inventory levels including the following      the need to maintain significant inventory of components that are in limited supply        buying components in bulk for the best pricing        responding to the unpredictable demand for products and        responding to customer requests for quick delivery schedules      if we accumulate excess or obsolete inventory price reductions and inventory write downs may result which could adversely affect our business and financial condition if we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology our competitors may develop products substantially similar to our products and use similar technologies which may result in the loss of customers      we rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality licensing and other contractual arrangements to establish and protect the proprietary aspects of our products our efforts may result in only limited protection and our competitors may develop market and sell products substantially equivalent to our products or utilize technologies similar to those we use if we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology these third parties will be able to compete more effectively against us which could result in the loss of customers and adversely affect our business our products and other proprietary rights may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties which may expose us to litigation      although we believe that our products do not infringe on any third partys patents we cannot be certain that we will not become involved in litigation involving patents or proprietary rights patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs and there can be no assurance that we will have the necessary financial resources to defend or prosecute our rights in connection with any such litigation responding to defending or bringing claims related to our intellectual property rights may require our management to redirect our human and monetary resources to address these claims a disruption in the manufacturing capabilities of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers would negatively impact our ability to meet customer demands      we rely on thirdparty manufacturers to manufacture and assemble our products we also depend upon thirdparty suppliers to deliver components that are free from defects competitive in functionality and cost and in compliance with our specifications and delivery schedules since we generally do not maintain large inventories of our products or components any termination of or significant disruption in our relationship with our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers may prevent us from filling customer orders in a timely manner      we have occasionally experienced and may in the future experience delays in delivery of products and delivery of products of inferior quality from thirdparty manufacturers although alternate manufacturers and suppliers are available to produce our products and product components the number of manufacturers or suppliers of some of our products and components is limited and qualifying a replacement manufacturer or supplier could take several months in addition our use of thirdparty manufacturers reduces our direct control over product quality manufacturing timing yields and costs disruption of the manufacture or supply of our products and    table of contents components or a thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers failure to remain competitive in functionality quality or price could delay or interrupt our ability to manufacture or deliver our products to customers on a timely basis which would have a material adverse effect on our business force majeure events such as terrorist attacks other acts of violence or war and health epidemics may affect the markets in which our common stock trades the markets in which we operate and our profitability      recent terrorist attacks and the war in iraq have caused instability in the global financial markets and contributed to downward pressure on securities prices of united states publicly traded companies future terrorist attacks or armed conflict and epidemics such as sars could result in economic political and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and further depress securities prices including the price of our common stock terrorist attacks have disrupted the global insurance and reinsurance industries and we may experience delays in renewing some insurance policies and may not be able to obtain insurance at historical levels for all of our facilities future terrorist attacks armed conflicts and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewhere our primary facilities include administrative sales and rd facilities in the united states and manufacturing facilities in china acts of terrorism wars and epidemics may make transportation of our supplies and products more difficult or cost prohibitive any impairment of our financial performance as a result of such events would increase the risk of noncompliance with the financial covenants under our senior secured credit facility and other lending arrangements resulting in events of default and the possible acceleration of our indebtedness our results of operations could be harmed if our operating expenses do not correspond with the timing of our revenue      most of our operating expenses such as employee compensation manufacturing and rental expense for properties are either relatively fixed in the shortterm or incurred in advance of sales moreover our spending levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue as a result if revenue for a particular quarter is below expectations we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter a shortfall in revenue therefore could have a disproportionate effect on our expected operating results for that quarter and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline if we cannot manage the additional challenges presented by our international operations our revenues and profitability may suffer      we derived approximately  of our total net revenues from sales outside the united states principally in latin america and europe for the year ended december   we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenue in the foreseeable future because a substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from foreign customers we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance and results of operations these risks include the following      we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that may change without notice        our expenses related to sales and marketing and research and development may increase        we are subject to various importexport restrictions and importexport licenses may not always be available        we are subject to foreign tariffs and other trade barriers        some of the foreign countries that we deal with suffer from political and economic instability    table of contents      some of the foreign currencies that we deal with fluctuate significantly and are subject to inflationary pressures        we may have difficulty staffing and managing our foreign operations        there is a tendency for international payment cycles to be longer than for our north american operations        we may have difficulty collecting accounts receivable and        we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations we are dependent on current management and key personnel the loss of certain of these individuals could cause material harm to the operation and future prospects of our business      christopher alexander our chairman president and chief executive officer john w smolak our executive vice president chief financial and administrative officer and jairo gonzalez president of hypercom transactions systems group are instrumental in the development growth and operations of hypercom the loss of any of these key executives could have a material adverse effect on the operation and future prospects of our business      we also believe our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highlyskilled hardware and software engineers managerial and sales and marketing personnel we compete against numerous companies including larger more established companies for our personnel we do not know if we will be successful in attracting or retaining skilled personnel further the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could negatively affect our financial performance we have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions and strategic investments which will involve numerous risks we may not be able to address these risks without substantial expense delay or other operational or financial problems      we may acquire or make substantial investments in related businesses technologies products or services in the future these acquisitions or investments involve various risks such as      the difficulty of assimilating the technologies operations and personnel of the acquired business technology product or service        the potential disruption of our ongoing business including the diversion of management attention    table of contents      the possible inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment        the loss of key employees of an acquired business and        the possibility of our entering markets and offering products or services with which we have limited prior experience      future acquisitions and investments could also result in substantial cash expenditures potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities our incurring of additional debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets that could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition our prior acquisitions have consumed and will continue to consume management attention and company resources and will continue to require significant efforts and involve ongoing risks in the integration of these operations to date we have not achieved expected results from certain of our acquisitions we will be dependent on the retention and performance of these businesses existing management and employees for the daytoday management and future operating results of these businesses risks related to the industry the markets in which we compete are highly competitive maturing and subject to price erosion      the markets in which we operate are maturing and highly competitive increased competition from manufacturers or distributors of products similar to or competitive with our products or from service providers that provide services similar to our services could result in price reductions reduced margins and a loss of market share or could render our products obsolete      we expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future with respect to our pos payment system products we compete primarily on the basis of easeofuse product performance price features quality the availability of application software programs the number of thirdparty network host and telecommunication system certifications we have obtained for our products and application programs rapid development release and delivery of software products and customer support and responsiveness software products compete on the basis of functionality scalability quality and support      in the pos terminal segment our global competitors are ingenico a francebased company verifone inc a privatelyheld domestic company and lipman an israelbased company in any particular market we may also find ourselves in competition with local or regional manufacturers and distributors        in the electronic cash register market we compete with companies such as ibm siemens ncr icl and micros        in the specialty network products niche of the marketplace our primary competitors are cisco com motorola and suntec all of which are usbased        we often face additional competitive factors in foreign countries including preferences for national vendors and difficulties in obtaining necessary certifications and in meeting the requirements of government policies some of our competitors and potential competitors are more established benefit from greater name recognition and have significantly greater resources than we do moreover there are limited barriers to entry that could keep our competitors from developing products or services and technology similar to ours or from selling competing products or services in our markets    table of contents we are subject to industry and technology changes and are dependent on development and market acceptance of new products if we are unable to adequately respond to these changes and to market demands in a timely manner our business will not be successful      the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid changes in technology and numerous new product introductions our success particularly in this industry depends to a large degree upon our continued ability to offer new products and enhancements to our existing products to meet changing market and industry requirements the introduction of new products and technologies by third parties could have an adverse effect on the sales of our existing products and technologies we cannot be certain of our ability to successfully      identify develop or manufacture new products and technologies        market or support these new products and technologies        eliminate defects in new products        control delays in introducing new products        gain market acceptance for the new products and technologies or        respond to technological changes new industry standards and announcements of new products by competitors      developing new products and technologies is a complex uncertain process requiring innovation and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends when changes to the product line are announced we will be challenged to manage possible shortened life cycles for existing products continue to sell existing products and prevent customers from returning existing products our inability to respond effectively to any of these challenges may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial success we may suffer other business and financial losses if we are not successful in marketing new products and responding to industry changes and new product introductions or enhancements by our competitors we are subject to extensive industry standards and government regulations our failure to properly comply with these standards and regulations could adversely affect our production and sales      our product sales are subject to a substantial and complex array of industry driven standards and governmental regulation both domestic and foreign including      industry standards imposed by europay international mastercard international visa international and others        certification standards required for connection to some public telecommunications networks        federal communications commission regulations and        underwriters laboratories regulations      our failure to properly comply with these standards and regulations could result in lost product sales significant costs associated with required remedial measures or production stoppages any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects    table of contents risks related to our common stock our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile your purchase of our stock will subject you to that volatility and to the risk of a substantial loss of your investment      the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile when we or our competitors announce new customer orders or services change pricing policies experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results announce strategic relationships acquisitions or dispositions change earnings estimates experience government regulatory actions or suffer from generally adverse economic conditions our stock price is often affected recently companies similar to ours have experienced extreme price fluctuations often for reasons unrelated to their performance we are subject to antitakeover effects of certain charter and bylaw provisions and delaware law      we have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which      make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us        may limit the price some investors are willing to pay for our common stock        enable us to issue preferred stock without a vote of our stockholders or other stockholder action        provide for a classified board of directors and regulate nominations for the board of directors        make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and        may delay or prevent a change of control      these and other provisions of our charter documents as well as certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make more difficult certain types of transactions involving a change of control of hypercom or our management as a result the price of our common stock may be adversely affected our stock price could be affected because a substantial number of shares of our common stock are available for sale      as of october   we had  shares of our common stock outstanding all of which were eligible for trading on the new york stock exchange we also had outstanding as of october   options and warrants to acquire an additional  shares of our common stock all of the shares underlying the outstanding options and warrants have been registered for resale future public sales of such common stock or the availability of such shares for sale including the shares subject to outstanding options and warrants and the shares registered under this transaction could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we do not plan to pay any dividends on our common stock      we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future our credit agreements restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock    table of contents risks related to our indebtedness our indebtedness and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to respond to changes in our business      as a result of the terms of our senior secured credit facility      our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and competitive pressures is heightened        we are and will continue to be governed by restrictive covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit our ability to among other things borrow additional funds make capital expenditures pay dividends make investments purchase our stock consummate asset sales or conduct mergers and acquisitions        our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry will be limited        we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates because some of our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates and        our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired      we cannot assure you that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities in addition we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when required or if available will be on terms satisfactory to us further even if we were able to obtain additional financing we may be required to use proceeds to repay a portion of our debt our loan agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants and if we are unable to comply with these covenants we will be in default a default could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness which would have an adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock      our senior secured credit facility contains customary covenants that require us to maintain certain specified financial ratios and consolidated net worth and restrict our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock prepay other debt or undertake various other corporate activities for example our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that subject to specified exceptions prohibit us from      incurring any additional indebtedness        incurring or permitting to exist any additional liens on our assets        engaging in a change of control transaction or other fundamental change such as a merger recapitalization or liquidation        disposing of our assets including equipment and inventory outside the ordinary course of business        prepaying or modifying the terms of our existing indebtedness except in connection with a permitted refinancing        redeeming or paying dividends or other distributions on our capital stock        engaging in certain transactions with our affiliates    table of contents      failing to maintain specified levels of ebitda and tangible net worth and ratios of senior debt and total debt to ebitda and        issuing or selling any prohibited preferred stock      if we are unable to comply with any of these covenants we will be in default which could cause crossdefaults under other loans or agreements a default if not waived by our lenders could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable if we were required to obtain waivers of defaults we may incur significant fees and transaction costs if waivers of defaults are not obtained and acceleration occurs we may not be able to repay our debt and we may not be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance this debt even if new financing is made available to us it may not be available on acceptable terms    table of contents use of
