include the following  we depend on reliable sources of raw materials and other supplies at a reasonable cost but availability of such materials and supplies could be interrupted andor the prices charged for them could escalate  the markets in which we participate are highly competitive and subject to intense price competition  we are striving to improve operating margins through sales growth price increases productivity gains and improved purchasing techniques but we may not be successful in achieving the desired improvements  we are engaged in restructuring programs to improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce costs if we are not successful in the execution of our restructuring programs we will not realize the expected cost savings  our products are sold into industries where demand is unpredictable cyclical or heavily influenced by consumer spending  the global scope of our operations exposes us to risks related to currency conversion and changing economic social and political conditions around the world  we have a growing presence in the asiapacific region where it can be difficult for an american company to compete lawfully with local competitors  regulatory authorities in the us european union and elsewhere are taking a much more aggressive approach to regulating hazardous materials and those regulations could affect sales of our products  our operations are subject to stringent environmental health and safety regulations and compliance with those regulations could require us to make significant investments  we depend on external financial resources and any interruption in access to capital markets or borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition  interest rates on some of our external borrowings are variable and our borrowing cost could be affected adversely by interest rate increases  many of our assets are encumbered by liens that have been granted to lenders and those liens affect our flexibility in making timely dispositions of property and businesses  we are subject to a number of restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and those covenants could affect our flexibility in funding strategic initiatives  we have significant deferred tax assets and our ability to utilize these assets will depend on our future performance  we are a defendant in several lawsuits that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition andor financial performance unless they are successfully resolved  our businesses depend on a continuous stream of new products and failure to introduce new products could affect our sales and profitability  employee benefit costs especially postretirement costs constitute a significant element of our annual expenses and funding these costs could adversely affect our financial condition  we are exposed to risks associated with acts of god terrorists and others as well as fires explosions wars riots accidents embargoes natural disasters strikes and other work stoppages
