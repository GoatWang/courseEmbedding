morgensonjan   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo the tahoe beach  ski club a timeshare resort on lake tahoe calif credit grand pacific resorts for more than  years mary ann gutierrez  has spent several weeks a year at on the southern shore of lake tahoe calif often playing host to her children and grandchildren at one of two timeshare units she ownswhen she checked into one of the properties last year she was stopped at the front desk a  gift card would be hers if she attended a presentation by diamond resorts international the company that owns the resort but first she had to fill out some papers and supply her credit card informationthe gift card came with a cost as ms gutierrez soon learned for five hours she said diamond representatives pushed her to give up both of her timeshare deeds including one at the nearby tahoe beach  ski club a resort that diamond does not own with the upgrade and membership in diamond’s ownership points system they said she would keep her maintenance costs low and could use her points at other resorts in the company’s network it would cost just  upfront they saideven when representatives suggested her maintenance fees would rise if she didn’t switch ms gutierrez kept declining saying that the cost was too high undeterred the diamond representatives suggested that she ask her children to pay for the upgrade she continued to say no and at last they let her go advertisement continue reading the main story “they weren’t going to let me out that door” ms gutierrez said “i was shaking i was so nervous” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the feeling turned to shock however when a diamond representative handed her a record of a voided charge in the amount of  on her credit card the representatives had been so certain that she would agree to the offer that they had charged her card for the down payment — even though she had not given approvalafter crashing in the financial collapse timeshare sales are rising again and with them highpressure sales practices such as those ms gutierrez described perhaps acknowledging these problems some in the industry have cautioned in recent months that regulators from the consumer financial protection bureau could increase their oversight new rules would affect all operators including big players like diamond interval leisure group marriott vacations worldwide and wyndham worldwide but tighter regulation might have an especially big impact on diamond because its business is devoted solely to timeshare sales and managementinterviews with timeshare owners lawyers and other specialists in the arena moreover suggest that diamond’s sales practices can be especially forcefuljeff weir is a diamond timeshare owner and journalist who writes about the industry for redweek an online timeshare site and regularly attends sales presentations to keep tabs on tactics employed by timeshare companies“in my experience diamond is much more ambitious aggressive and downright nasty in their sales presentations compared to marriott and westin” he said in an interview “diamond just has an amazing reputation of being tough on people”david f palmer diamond’s chief executive sees its sales methods in a very different light in an interview mr palmer described how diamond tries to bring fun to its customer interactions both before an initial sale and once a member buys in “the industry didn’t quite realize that you have to engage and create intimacy and pervasiveness with somebody that you don’t really know” he said “our lifetime subscription model creates a series of systems where you can track that engagement and make sure you are constantly providing a series of experiences that exceed their expectations over many many years”neither mr palmer nor the company’s spokeswoman would discuss ms gutierrez’s experience but on the topic of highpressure sales tactics mr palmer said “i have belligerently zero tolerance for anyone who goes off script” advertisement continue reading the main story diamond has had great success in the industry in less than  years the company’s revenue reached  million last year more than double the  figure its average timeshare transaction price was  last year up from  in but while diamond’s growth has benefited its executives — mr palmer received a total of  million in compensation in the most recent two years for which figures are available — the company’s business practices seem to have alienated some customers photo jacob bercu a retired silicon valley software engineer and a timeshare owner and board member at tahoe beach  ski has fought efforts by diamond resorts international to control the board credit preston gannaway for the new york times in lawsuits and in interviews customers complain not only of highpressure sales but also of skyhigh maintenance fees and frustration at procedures that block club members from taking vacations where and when they want perhaps most distressing to owners is the fact that once you buy into a timeshare it is almost impossible to get outlarry vicks a retired engineer in upstate new york is a disgruntled diamond resort member who read the transcript of a diamond conference call with wall street analysts and investors “it made me laugh how they are making boatloads of money” he said in an interview “the reason i’m laughing is that it’s all at my expense”‘we love to say yes’about nine million households in the united states own timeshares and sales have increased about  percent since  in a typical timeshare deal a buyer pays for an interval at a resort condominium maybe one or two weeks a year and agrees to pay homeowners’ association dues covering maintenance and taxes on the property some buyers pay upfront while others finance their purchases often through the company selling the unitsin the early years of timeshares owners received deeds specifying their ownership now the industry has moved to a system where buyers receive a certain number of points they can use for time and amenities rather than a deedmany timeshare buyers say they like being assured time at a resort they enjoy without the hassle of owning a second home using their points for a vacation at a different location managed by their timeshare company is another potential benefitdiamond which was created in  by stephen j cloobeck a veteran of the vacation ownership industry has its headquarters in las vegas the company operates  resorts worldwide and has associations with an additional  resorts and four cruise itineraries that it says its members can use the company’s tagline “we love to say yes” advertisement continue reading the main story but two lawsuits filed against diamond suggest a less solicitous attitude one that reflects the experience of ms gutierrez in lake tahoe one case was filed in october  in california in it  timeshare owners said they had agreed to pay to upgrade their membership in the diamond resorts after the upgrade the lawsuit says the members were unable to use the resorts they had hoped to and their maintenance fees rose even though diamond’s representatives had told them they would falla florida lawsuit filed in march  said that diamond tried to pressure the plaintiffs to upgrade to what amounted to “programs to fleece more and more money out of the plaintiffs”the two suits seek cancellation of the contracts money back and unspecified damagesdiamond declined to comment on the california case it said that the litigants in the florida suit “never made a purchase from diamond” but were owners in a resort company it had purchased without assuming such liabilitiesnot all of diamond’s customers are unhappy of course six members whose names were supplied by diamond were all complimentarywalter hunter a retired chemist who lives in fort collins colo is one a member of the homeowners’ association board at daytona beach regency a diamond resort in florida mr hunter  said in an interview that he was happy with the company’s management with diamond “we’ve been more pleased the resort is better managed” he said although he acknowledged that maintenance costs rose significantly after diamond came in he said “we are convinced that they are doing a good job”a potential liabilityowners of timeshares in desirable resorts with unusual attributes like a private beach can often sell their ownership interests on the secondary market but in areas glutted with condos for sale or rent selling a timeshare can be almost impossible in these cases timeshare ownership can become an almost perpetual liabilitya recent search on ebay for example showed more than  timeshare listings for sale many from pennsylvania to hawaii to florida can be purchased for  in its financial filings diamond acknowledges that “generally members of the clubs do not have the right to terminate their membership”rubén peña’s experience is a case in point an engineering consultant with pro data inc in jersey city mr peña has never been inside the las vegas timeshare he bought  years ago after spending roughly  to buy and maintain the property over those years mr peña stopped paying his loan which had an original interest rate approaching  percent and maintenance fees he bought the timeshare from a company called pacific monarch resorts which went bankrupt diamond now owns and manages the resort photo rubén peña of jersey city has spent about  on a las vegas timeshare in a property diamond now owns he has tried unsuccessfully to deed it back to the company credit yana paskova for the new york times “i wanted to deed back the property to diamond and get my equity of about  out” mr peña said in an interview “but i got no response whatsoever” advertisement continue reading the main story before he stopped paying his loan in  mr peña was being charged  a year in interest taxes and maintenance fees for his ownership interest in the timeshare expediacom offers a week at the propertyfor at most a little over diamond declined to comment on mr peña but the company said that one reason it doesn’t buy back members’ stakes is that it would create accounting problems related to how diamond had booked the revenue newsletter sign up continue reading the main story

company’s suggestion he said that he was pleased with diamond’s resort management but he added that he was troubled by the company’s refusal to buy back timeshare holdings from customers who can no longer afford them or just want out acknowledging that this practice is industrywide he said changing it would be an “ownerfriendly” move by diamond“if it’s paidup on the principal they could purchase that from an owner at maybe a reduced market value that helps the person who wants to say goodbye” he said not making that effort he added “could be something that blows up in their face”companies like diamond benefit from the lack of an organized buyers’ market for timeshares the company’s most recent annual financial filing noted that if such a market “were to become more organized and liquid” the resulting availability of vacation units “could adversely affect our sales and our sales prices”and even if an owner defaults and walks away from maintenance fees diamond can prosper it simply repossesses the unit at little cost and tries to resellthis “inventoryrecapture model” is industrywide and allows companies to acquire units far more cheaply than it costs to build properties or buy resorts in a company presentation last november diamond said it typically pays  to the homeowners’ association to take back a timeshare week then it sells the space for an average of  it saidlast year the company introduced a “relinquishment option” for members of its european resorts if they agree to pay two years of maintenance costs they can escape their obligations advertisement continue reading the main story customer complaints across the industry have grown loud and in recent months the stocks of diamond and other timeshare companies have fallen in the face of market chatter that the consumer financial protection bureau might write new rules to address industry practices even as diamond’s earnings almost tripled in the first nine months of  over the same period a year earlier the company’s shares are down  percent from their high of last marchan official at the bureau declined to comment on the industryaggressive sales tactics are among the most common complaints typically potential timeshare buyers are invited to a free or lowcost minivacation at a resort if they agree to attend a sales presentation during their stay participants say fasttalking commissionpaid sales representatives often run these events emphasizing the merits of timeshares as investments and downplaying their shortcomingscustomers are told the meetings will last less than two hours but they often go on far longer and participants find it difficult to leavemichael d finn is a partner at the finn law group in largo fla whose busy practice consists solely of helping timeshare owners walk away from their obligations “every timeshare contract i have ever seen contains a clause with a phrase something like ‘i did not rely on any oral representations in order to make my decision to purchase this timeshare’” mr finn said in an interview “i call that the salesman’s licensetolie clause because that encourages them to do whatever they have to do to close that person that day”speaking about the industry generally mr finn said that buyers are often led to believe they are making a real estate deal and that their holding will have a value that they can recoup in a resale or pass on to their children photo stephen j cloobeck founded diamond in  and earned  million as a director in  the company which is based in las vegas operates  resorts worldwide credit jeffrey r staabcbs via getty images “nothing can be further from the truth” mr finn saidin november diamond said that over the last  months it had conducted about  tours at its  sales offices around the world the company says that  percent of tours result in salesdiamond says its innovative programs “infuse hospitality into our sales and marketing efforts” its “events of a lifetime” include golf outings with a professional spring training with reggie jackson the baseball hall of famer or tickets to a show near a diamondowned resortin the interview mr palmer said he was proud that roughly  percent of the company’s sales came from existing customers “i wear it like a badge of honor” he said “these people bought from us and they want to own more” advertisement continue reading the main story in addition he noted sales are regulated by state authorities “no one stumbles into a purchase here” he said “people have five to  days to think about it”but even fans of diamond recognize that accusations of highpressure sales tactics in the industry can be problematic for property managers “there’s some natural tension between management who wants to create the best experience possible and the sales organization — they are motivated to want different things” said terry timm a diamond timeshare owner who is chief administrative officer of thrivent a financial services company “the way timeshare sales are structured have really really incentivized the wrong things”a  profitdiamond often buys resorts that have fallen into bankruptcy acquiring timeshare owners as part of the deals after diamond takes over a resort it usually becomes the management company and often raises maintenance feessome of these increases reflect the costs of necessary improvements at resorts that have fallen on hard times but diamond members who are critical of the company say that it typically gains control of the resort’s governing board known as the homeowners’ association giving timeshare owners little say in how money is spentowners at some resorts are wary about ceding any board control to diamond jacob bercu is a retired silicon valley software engineer and longtime resort owner at tahoe beach  ski a few years ago some of the resort’s roughly  owners noticed that diamond was buying up defaulted timeshare segments at county tax auctions last september he won a board seat sought by a diamond representative “we took aggressive action to keep them away from the ownership to convince our owners not to sell out and instead to vote for us so we keep control” mr bercu saidtimeshare owners of the grand beach resort a unit property in orlando fla on the other hand learned in a letter in september that their annual maintenance fee would rise  percent this year management fees paid by the resort members the letter said are expected to jump to a total of  million from about  in diamond said the increases at grand beach resulted from a new management contract consistent with the company’s deals elsewhere and higher operating costs and reserves for renovationsthe chief beneficiary of these cost increases is diamond which levies management fees at the properties it owns and operates diamond tells investors that it typically reaps a fee equal to as much as  percent more than the costs of running a resort labor utilities taxes and other overhead including the reserve funds kept for emergencies advertisement continue reading the main story “anything that is put in the budget that gets expended on an annual basis we get our  percent fee” mr palmer explained to investors at a september  conference according to a transcript “that is basically a  percent profit business”in the interview mr palmer added that the company was completely transparent with owners about its charges “all the costs are disclosed on a private website” he said “there are no hidden fees”diamond’s founder mr cloobeck is something of a celebrityhe has appeared on the cbs television show

diamond resorts and its perpetual mortgage machine  southern investigative reporting foundation diamond resorts and its perpetual mortgage machine – southern investigative reporting foundation southern investigative reporting foundation  indepth financial investigative reporting for the common good southern investigative reporting foundation httpsirfonlineorg stories diamond resorts and its perpetual mortgage machine by roddy boyd  march   since  the website of diamond resorts international has made people think their personal sixnight stay in heaven is only a few clicks away online the company’s resorts full of beaches and golf courses still beckon but diamond is a stcentury timeshare operation and investors ought to be wary of any company using the controversial vacation concept that has provided decades of fodder for comedy writers while troubling state and federal regulators indeed what las vegasbased diamond is selling is a sleeker more expensive iteration called a vacationownership interest or voi and it seems to have proved successful for diamond at least thus far as is the case with buying a timeshare customers purchase from diamond the right to an annual oneweek vacation at a resort there are some important differences though customers aren’t receiving a deeded right to a week’s stay at a specific resort rather they gain the right to stay at a collection of companyowned properties in the united states south america europe or asia they can also buy a membership in a “trust” that allows for stays at other venues when buying the vacationownership interest they receive “points” that can be redeemed for a week’s stay — even at resorts and on cruises with which diamond is affiliated but doesn’t own the concept of points is key think of them as a virtual currency albeit one for which diamond is both the dealer and the federal reserve purchasing more points means that a member has greater latitude to book a vacation especially during peak seasons it also means that the customer has spent a good deal of money in contrast having a lower point total may require a member to reserve certain properties as much as  months in advance determining the price of points is part of the voi negotiation process when a new member signs up thus a point does not have a fixed dollar value a chart with data culled from member lawsuits against diamond seems to indicate that over the past three years the dollar value of a point has been trending lower customers can expect to pay about  for a voi for one week a year and about  in annual maintenance fees and a voi is a socalled perpetual use product with a lifetime contract that’s difficult for a member to be extricated from — and there’s no resale market that he or she could tap for cash the mandatory five to day cooling off period after a member first signs up is the only chance a customer has for canceling the contract before entering a lasting financial commitment to diamond the company has said it may make some modifications to this policy in the future diamond faces considerable challenges in selling its main product — the voi — given the current economics of the travel industry travel websites and apps like expediacom hotelscom and airbnb frequently let wouldbe vacationers procure the equivalent of a diamond resort stay for less than the company’s annual voi maintenance fees many diamond resorts even allow nonmembers to reserve rooms through consumer travel sites but when a member relies on diamond’s financing banks don’t do voi financing this can push the combined annual maintenance fee and loanpayment expense to more than  a mighty price tag for a week’s stay diamond disagreed with this assessment arguing at length that focusing solely on cost sacrifices the value of convenience and flexibility one fact that diamond’s management might not dispute is the warm reception investors and brokerage analysts have bestowed thus far rare indeed is the brokerage analyst who has not been impressed by diamond has sustained growth trajectory the company booked more than  million in sales last year a spike from ’s  million and diamond’s share price has steadily ticked northward from  during its july  initial public offering to  a year ago this resulted in a  billion market capitalization when the company’s shares reached their peak value in february  for the founding management and investment group that still owns more than  percent of the shares outstanding this translated into over a  million stake at that time yet in late january a new york times investigation showed that some of diamond’s rapid growth might be due to overly aggressive sales practices the times article roundly spooked investors and almost  million of market capitalization was lost for more than three weeks before diamond’s share price recovered in response the company issued a press release emphasizing its “zero tolerance” policy toward misleading sales tactics the southern investigative reporting foundation spent two months investigating diamond’s murky soup of public accounting and disclosures to explore the financial mechanics of the company’s success this investigation found that the financial statements have a very large red flag simply put there are a lot of close parallels to how subprime mortgage finance companies rapidly expanded in the last decade the most obvious similarity lies in the drive to ensure a steady stream of borrowers whose downpayment cash will keep a company operating diamond faces four interconnected problems the company cannot survive on the amount of cash sales it makes so it needs to finance sales diamond has to securitize those loans to bring cash in the door or run the risk of losing money on every sale to retain favorable terms for monetizing its debt the company has to use its own cash to make up shortfalls in the securitization pools since the realized value on customers’ loans is less than the amount diamond has borrowed against them it needs to monetize new loans faster and faster recent history suggests that the fate of a company like this is not pretty in an effort to provide readers a clearer view of diamond’s responses the company’s replies in full to specific questions have been embedded throughout this story of special interest are the replies supplied on feb  feb  feb  feb  and march    ———————– since  diamond has experienced a decline in its voi sales to new members as a percentage of the company’s entire voi sales although the percentage did modestly increase last year from  according to the justfiled k annual report for   percent of last year’s voi unit revenue came from new members in  that figure was  percent what’s the reason for the broad decline it’s not immediately clear diamond dismissed a reporter’s recent question about the possibility of a decline in voi sales to new members citing the dollar growth of their purchases the estimated dollar value of new member sales did increase to about  million last year from  million in  by contrast new members at diamond’s two biggest rivals marriott vacations worldwide and wyndham worldwide accounted for  percent and  percent respectively of their companies’ voi revenues last year common sense would suggest that absent large blocks of new members arriving organically or through a purchase of a rival company diamond’s continually pushing current members to upgrade their vois will eventually result in diminishing returns in addition the number of “owner families” has decreased in three of the past four years as owner families drop away from diamond the prospect of enticing existing members to upgrade their vacation owner interest becomes threatened diamond stopped reporting the number of owner families in the third quarter of  without notice an archived investorrelations web page from june   tallied the number of owner families at  which is a decline to the level in early    source diamond resorts sec filings   when asked why the company abruptly stopped disclosing the number of “owner families” in its public documents diamond replied that it has stopped providing the number because a large amount of its paying customers are hotel guests or use a socalled timeshare exchange network like rci or interval ceo david palmer’s remarks about industry consolidation made during the company’s thirdquarter conference call this past fall seemed to indicate that diamond might be seeking additional acquisitions when diamond released its annual earnings report in late february however the company disclosed it had retained centerview partners to “explore strategic alternatives” — wall street shorthand for seeking a buyer selling a company when its revenue grew at almost  percent last year and net income more than doubled is an unusual approach for a board of directors to take especially since the shares nearly  percent off their highs managers with conviction about company prospects would ordinarily be seeking to add capital and expand the business or to borrow money to take the firm private instead diamond’s leaders seem to want an exit what follows below is probably the reason why the  k shows  percent of voi sales had what the company calls “a financing component” which can be compared with  percent in       source diamond resorts sec filings figures expressed in thousands   the trend over the second half of last year is even more pronounced in the third quarter customers relied on company financing for  percent of voi purchases and in the fourth quarter  percent of voi purchases were financed this way what should shareholders be concerned that almost  percent of diamond’s customers last year borrowed money for their week in the sun the credit crisis of  is evidence that consumers with high fixedcost debt can in the aggregate do grave damage to a company whose sales are reliant on financing when one checks numbers culled from diamond’s november securitization it takes little imagination to see how a voi membership can quickly turn into a dangerous burden for a consumer consider this the average loan in this securitization pool is for  when that amount is coupled with an  percent interest rate for a year term this locks a member into a  monthly payment that’s  annually for the member — with at least another  in annual maintenance fees the  k said the average voi transaction size in last year was  and the average down payment was  percent or  diamond told the southern investigative reporting foundation that these are not regulated loans like mortgages but rather socalled righttouse contracts it described as a prepaid subscription product without a real estate component it’s worth noting that several paragraphs disclosing potential risks for investors were added to diamond’s new k about the potential for expanded consumer financial protection bureau regulation of voi sales diamond argued in its filings that other members of the voi industry offer their customers financing but unlike marriott worldwide vacation and wyndham worldwide which financed  percent and  percent of their voi sales last year respectively diamond’s customer base appears to be dependent on it make no mistake offering customers financing of as much as  percent of the price of a voi has enabled diamond’s rapid sales growth with the amount of cash sales a paltry  percent to  percent in the second half of last year this kind of financing keeps a stream of money from down payments flowing so to ensure working capital and manage risk diamond set up a securitization program chief financial officer alan bentley explained why securitization is crucial to the company’s needs during a presentation in march  shown on page  of the official transcript “if i use an example that the customer did a  transaction with us they’ve made a  down payment which means we did a  loan … well that  is on the  transaction right so you look that and say ‘okay you got — you did  deal’ you’ve got  out of pocket because you’re paying for your marketing costs you’re paying for your sales commissions et cetera so that part’s outofpocket so effectively you’re upside down remember so you got  down got  outofpocket so how do we monetize that and get the cash during the quarters what we will do is remonetize that by placing those receivables into a conduit facility now that conduit of course is we have a  million facility and that  million conduit facility is we will quarterly place those receivables into that conduit for which we receive an  advance rate right so we get that cash back at that  level on that — on the conduit” whatever diamond borrows from the conduit facilities is repaid when it securitizes its receivables when one looks from a distance the program seems to have put diamond in a virtuous cycle — of issuing highinterest highfee loans bringing in interest income and freeing up cash for its sales force to secure additional sales moreover the bonds that emerge from these securitizations have performed well to date then again they should diamond typically has the option to repurchase or substitute in a new loan when a loan defaults and use its own cash to make up a shortfall according to the kroll bond rating agency “diamond has historically utilized these options resulting in no defaults on their securitizations” these voi loans do have one truly unusual characteristic though diamond’s members are paying off the loans much faster than their rivals’ customers wyndham’s voi loans are paid off on average in about four years diamond members are paying off their loans in about  years in  diamond’s members retained a loan for about  years on average but the problem with virtuous cycles is that they can spin the other way too if there are broad economic problems borrowers might start wrestling with job losses or wage pressures and then the speed of prepayment might sharply decline when that happens typically the number of loans in arrears increase if the prepayment speeds stay lower for long enough diamond — which has used its own cash and fresh loans in the past to help the loans in the securitization pools avoid defaults — might have to come up with a serious cash injection diamond said its assetbacked bonds are prepaid so quickly because its customers tend to make voi purchases while on vacation and upon returning home quickly pay off the loans sirf’s reporting laid out in detail below suggests an entirely different answer after weeks of investigation the southern investigative reporting foundation came across an obscure accounting rule called accounting standards codification topic  which went into effect in december  that allows diamond — or any timeshare company — to recognize revenue from upgraded sales even if the member doesn’t put any money down newmember sales in contrast are accounted for only when at least  percent of the voi’s value has been received if asc ’s logic is counterintuitive to outsiders for diamond’s management it is surely heaven sent on the view that a timeshare purchase is a real estate transaction an upgrade to a vacation ownership interest is considered a “modification and continuation” of the existing sales contract how does this work in real life say a new member purchases his or her voi for  and puts  down a  percent equity stake if six months later that member seeks to upgrade to an expanded membership level that costs  and signs a sales contract to that effect diamond could account for this as a sale even if no money is put down that  percent equity stake which is really now  percent given the  additional financed is all the legal cover the diamond accountants need since the upgrade is considered a modification and continuation of the initial timeshare purchases contract diamond’s computers can now record a new  loan to pay off the initial  loan and book  in new revenue this appears to be why diamond has such high prepayment of its loans if the whole things seems circular that’s because it is a lending facility that diamond controls loans an existing member  and it goes on the books as revenue but not a penny of cash has gone into the coffers — yet plus that initial  loan is now accounted for as fully repaid even if it is not the member still owes  plus the hefty interest rate and it’s completely legal so who is responsible for this accounting stroke of genius none other than the senior accounting staff from the timeshare industry’s leading companies who proposed this new rule in  at the very minimum asc  should give investors pause about diamond’s quality of earnings when asked if the new accounting rule had spurred the high prepayment speeds of its loans diamond pointed to its customers’ creditworthiness as the cause   ————————   evidence is beginning to mount that some of diamond’s borrowers are struggling with their obligations less than two weeks ago diamond disclosed a  percent increase in the amount of its provisions for uncollectible sales revenue in the fourth quarter of  to  million from  million a year prior in the company’s release the jump was attributed to a change of certain portfolio statistics during the quarter” suggesting some degree of credit performance woes the southern investigative reporting foundation asked the company to elaborate on the “certain portfolio statistics” that proved nettlesome and in a lengthy answer it ignored the request to discuss the specific statistics behind the spike in uncollectible sales reserves but merely referenced issues that might have informed its decision nor is that the only data point that suggests looming headaches the default rate on diamond’s loan portfolio last year was  percent the highest the company ever reported source diamond resorts sec filings analyzing the health of diamond’s loan portfolio is not a cutanddried exercise its rivals marriott vacation and wyndham worldwide wait  days and  days respectively before they charge off their bad loans diamond uses  days a full two months longer asked about why the company waits  days diamond said it’s a matter of internal policy and that there is no rule governing time frames for charging off bad loans the more diamond’s securitization program has expanded the deeper underwater the company has become in  it reported  million in securitized notes and funding capacity against  million in receivables this means that if the company had to pay off its bonds it had a nearly  million surplus of money owed it to draw upon as the securitization program doubled in size however that surplus evaporated last year diamond borrowed  million against a net receivables balance of  million amounting to a  million deficit in other words diamond would have to come up with cash rather than substituting loans to make its bondholders whole the southern investigative reporting foundation excluded adjustments because they were noncash accruals and assumed that receivables that weren’t securitized have a zero net realizable value otherwise the  million deficit would be greater during the same fiveyear period the average seasoning of loans the amount of time that the loans are kept on diamond’s books before they are placed in a securitization pool dropped to three

months from jan  it asks members to go for purely information updates and then tells you that prices will e locked for  months at £x pp and the price will go up during that time by a factor of  during this charade an accountant comes in and tells you thatquite inexplicably a previous offer which is  of x is still on the books he tells you to sign a price of paper withdrawing from this and to sign another locking you into the higher price you will probably then refuse and this will open the doors for you to exercise you fortunate option on the lower price this happened to me and we were even put under pressure to buy half the number of points that we had been offered just one big scam and many brits are electively blind to it thank you reply ↓ dear mike thanks for that we attended a presentation  a diamond discovery overview according to their t and cs last week even after reading what you had to say we were taken by surprise the second salesman came up with a document showing we had attended a ‘points auction’ at a holiday in cromer we took in  and could still buy at £ per point unfortunately he chose a holiday which we had booked for our daughter so we weren’t actually there thanks to you we signed his waiver form quite happily despite all protestations we found the presentation very worrying and intimidating and we will not be going back for another anthony reply ↓ my husband and i are diamond owners we have repeatedly asked to be taken off their call list when we checked into grand beach orlando in  we were asked to attend a group presentation three times i asked if we would be paired with a commissioned sales person and three times we were told no they said we would talk to a commissioned agent only if we had questions in the last ten minutes the appointment form for the “nonsales” presentation said in fine print we were agreeing to be “robo” called we did not sign the form but are still called almost daily when we went to the reception area for the nonsales presentation we were greeted by a commissioned sales agent after the  minute guaranteed nonsales presentation we were high pressured for another three hours by increasingly sophisticated sales people there needs to be greater disclosure calling it what it is it’s not an owner’s update it’s a sales presentation why have an owner sign off on a  minute presentation when they are held hostage for an additional three hours no one asked us to sign a form agreeing to that i encourage people thinking about investing in diamond to google diamond resorts complaints and drip which stands for diamond resorts international protesters the website was started by  british owners trying to get out of their ownership if life lands you a hard blow owners are charged  interest the day they are late on an investment they can’t sell diamond encourages their owners to think of their points as a second home what second home would you buy that could not be sold we are not unhappy with the program but would get out if we could due to very high pressure tactics we would like to stay in nyc but points required would be  in february this would be equal to  in our maintenance fees for a room at the same hotel that could be booked for  for the same week including taxes we have no problem with availability if we want to stay in orlando or the ozarks which we don’t we enjoyed time share for  years until we learned what we will have to go through every time we check in at diamond my husband just turned  yesterday he received a happy birthday time share solicitation to buy more points i would be ashamed to own stock in this company or any of their competitors after reading complaints from real people behind the  million th quarter uncollected vacation interest provision from diamond and from their competitors it’s just a number to them until there is a legitimate secondary market too many people can be hurt reply ↓ you don’t have to do the owner updates you can say no and after  minutes i got up and left and told them i was told  minutes and i had other plans i left with my “gift” and have never done another owner update even though they ask me each time i check in reply ↓ dear irene i have read a number of your articles about diamond membership my wife and i have deliberately avoided attending any of their presentations since the fractional ownership sales pitch several years ago this year we were offered by e mail a reduced rate vacation at pine lake one of the t and cs being that we attend a presentation a diamond discovery overview having read what mike above had to say we went along it went just as he said and we signed their waiver form quite happily despite their protestations as a diamond member from across the pond if there is any useful information i can provide for you let me know anthony reply ↓ great writeup even a slow brain like mine now understands the intricacies of drii’s business which i never had explored looks like investors are extremely worried about their business as well with short interest steadily climbing over the past year httpwwwnasdaqcomsymboldriishortinterest reply ↓ this report is misleading at best and full of inaccuracies as listed below in summary your article does not articulate a reason that diamond’s equity drii should trade for a  discount to its peers marriot vacations vac and wyndham wyn i suggest readers carefully review the author’s notes which are provided through links throughout the report to provide better context and a clearer picture  you stated “troubling state and federal regulators” and provided a link that leads to an article about fraud in timeshare resale which are “telemarketing companies that market their advertising services to timeshare owners interested in selling or renting their timeshare interests” this is effectively the opposite of diamond’s business which is selling the timeshare ownership to these owners initially  you stated “the dollar value of a point has been trending lower” and provide a link to a chart the chart is difficult to read without headings but the annual decline in “value per point” from your first data point in  to your last in  is  this equates to it costing a consumer  more each year to buy the same number of points stated differently it is inflation coupled with pricing power how many good companies do you know that have raised prices  per year to be clear the “value of points” has not declined but only the cost of those has risen if i buy  points for  today those  points will always get me access to the same resorts however someone next year will have to pay more for those same  points i am confident that you’ll find all of diamond’s peers like most good companies raise prices each year  “one fact that diamond’s management might not dispute is the warm reception investors and brokerage analysts have bestowed thus far” false and to my initial comment diamond’s shares trade at a  discount to peers and only briefly at its peak did they trade inline so i would not characterize that as a “warm reception”  “the company cannot survive on the amount of cash sales it makes so it needs to finance sales” false in fact from  to  it did just this with  sales paid in cash economics  would tell you that your preference would be to allow consumers to finance sales once you are comfortable with their credit profiles because they are able to generate cash off the sale and financing of those providing financing also enables more consumers to have access to timeshare ownership  “diamond has to securitize those loans to bring cash in the door or run the risk of losing money on every sale” false they have conduit facilities that provide financing and could rely on these but the advance rates are better on securitizations  “to retain favorable terms for monetizing its debt the company has to use its own cash to make up shortfalls in the securitization pools” false they have never injected cash into their securitizations in fact they have among the highest rated securitizations in the industry  “since  diamond has experienced a decline in its voi sales to new members as a percentage of the company’s entire voi sales” misleading and as you correctly then state because sales to existing members has grown also the inverse of this comment is sales to existing members as a  of the total has increased if the company is so terrible then why are more existing members adding points  “by contrast new members at diamond’s two biggest rivals marriott vacations worldwide and wyndham worldwide accounted for  percent and  percent respectively of their companies’ voi revenues last year” misleading those peers did not acquire  resorts in the past five years part of diamond’s strategy has been to acquire resorts and then bring those members into their system including these acquired members sales to nonexisting members is   “in addition the number of “owner families” has decreased in three of the past four years” not clear that is true they had been including families of acquired entities that were not current on maintenance fees which should not have been included in the first place  “ceo david palmer’s remarks about industry consolidation made during the company’s thirdquarter conference call this past fall seemed to indicate that diamond might be seeking additional acquisitions” falsemisleading hence the company made two acquisitions following these comments  “selling a company when its revenue grew at almost  percent last year and net income more than doubled is an unusual approach for a board of directors to take especially since the shares nearly  percent off their highs managers with conviction about company prospects would ordinarily be seeking to add capital and expand the business or to borrow money to take the firm private instead diamond’s leaders seem to want an exit” misleading as you so aptly pointed out the company’s financial results have been impressive yet the stock is down  management recognizes this disconnect and is therefore pursing strategic alternatives to find a private buyer that appreciates their true value given their significant ownership stake and appreciation for their true value i believe it is highly unlikely that management will “exit” and instead will borrow to effectuate a buyout it is standard for a board to run a formal process once management expresses an interest in a buyout because management and the board do not want to be sued by shareholders claiming management “stole the company” at a low price this potential for a buyout is the greatest risk to shorting this stock  “but unlike marriott worldwide vacation and wyndham worldwide which financed  percent and  percent of their voi sales last year respectively diamond’s customer base appears to be dependent on it” misleading unlike its peers diamond does not include cash down payments in its calculation  of sales financed with debt with an average down payment of  this implies that  of diamond’s sales are paid with cash so much closer to its peers  “if the prepayment speeds stay lower for long enough diamond — which has used its own cash and fresh loans in the past to help the loans in the securitization pools avoid defaults — might have to come up with a serious cash injection” false it has never injected cash it has simply replaced loans refinanced with new loans also and more importantly diamond is not required to use cash and loans but to simply remarket for new loans to replace those under default  “the default rate on diamond’s loan portfolio last year was  percent the highest the company ever reported” false pg  of its most recent k specifically states it has ranged from  to  since   “its rivals marriott vacation and wyndham worldwide wait  days and  days respectively before they charge off their bad loans diamond uses  days a full two months longer” misleading it should not change the calculation of net receivables and simply means the bad debt reserve should be lower for peers as articulated in the note you provide in a link  “the more diamond’s securitization program has expanded the deeper underwater the company has become… as the securitization program doubled in size however that surplus evaporated last year diamond borrowed  million against a net receivables balance of  million amounting to a  million deficit in other words diamond would have to come up with cash rather than substituting loans to make its bondholders whole” misleading and false the company had mm of gross receivables as of  which is the appropriate number to compare as opposed to net receivables a company that has grown free cash flow per share by doubledigits for each of the past few years while issuing some of the highestrated securitizations does not describe one that is going “deeper underwater”  “during the same fiveyear period the average seasoning of loans the amount of time that the loans are kept on diamond’s books before they are placed in a securitization pool dropped to three months last july from  months in an april  offering” misleading last year marked the first year that they had sufficient receivables due to successful growth to access the securitization market twice which is a positive because it results in loans being converted to more cash quicker reply ↓ thank you for the facts but you aren’t mentioning a few simple observations if the vacation club ownership was any type of a great deal then how can you explain that they have zero value people are trying to simply give their ownerships away go to facebook google it under dri groups forums with regard to maintenance fees even more ridiculous is the  increase of fees if it were merely  a large number of owners would not be looking to give their ownership away if you had a membership in  or  your maintenance fees are  to  more than they were so your numbers are incorrect again if they had all this cash on hand it’s because of the ridiculous yearly maintenance fee increases again not  a year in some cases they have increased the number of points needed at certain resorts they also changed the rules on how they operate for silverplatinum ownerships they used to have points discounted at all resorts within  days or less of reservation date no longer is this the case unless they want to they now charge to add a guest to a reservation a benefit that was free until this year they are also manipulating inventory i have known a few people including myself where my points were missing from our accounts one person it was  months before points were return and another it was  months i’m on month  the manipulation of inventory is obvious because you can look online at on the online booking sites to see diamond resortsproperties available through these venues but there is no availability for an owners to use their points from their ownership plenty of units and unit sizes available to rent yeah they are going to try to say something about developer units well then i guess it’s ok to rent units by anyone if the developermanagement is allowed to do rentals so that doesn’t make it right what’s worse the amount they are charging for the rentals are less than what it would cost for an owners maintenance fee cost in other words for  nights it may cost  pts or the equivalent to about  in maintenance fees but yet the online rental may cost  for the same  nights this again is just plain wrong for the sake of making a higher profit to eventually sell the company again obviously when an owner can’t find availability in their ownership dashboard online more and more owners are realizing what they own would be a lot cheaper if they just rented directly from an online booking source heaven forbid if an owner has a mortgage and yearly maintenance a double whammy no wonder so many owners would rather just get rid of their ownership than recoup any money with regard to the notion they aren’t using owner updates to pay off one loan to get an owner into another loan is blatantly naive that piece of work makes it look like  of a loan was paid off then another loan was activated for accounting purposes which you can use to slant to your best advantage such as knowing you were going to sell to make your company look a lot more valuable there possibly has already been a lawsuit against diamond in the eu or some sort of regulation in the eu because of there predatory actions against their timeshare owners when someone speaks of other ownerships marriott ownerships may cost nearly the same as a new diamond owner the marriott properties are much nicer than the diamond properties therefore it’s not really apples to apples marriott also doesn’t mark up their yearly maintenance fees at  per year they also aren’t trying to rent out their owners use online wyndham diamond bluegreen all do the deceptive practice of renting owners use with online booking sources wyndham raises their yearly fees just as diamond does they are nearly identical in their predatory practices against owners bottom line diamond got out in the nick of time with a high valuation they have already priced their product out of the market place a low amount of points good enough for  weeks a year best case scenario cost over  to finance plus maintenance fees will be over yr in this day and age of internet discount pricing and being able to book instantly there is no way they can keep raising their prices or refinance people into a larger ownership of k with a great amount of success the cash they get as down payment will not recover enough for expenses of the entire company so going public was the perfect escape plus previous financing all that mumbo jumbo is just that this is just like a home mortgage except you own a few days to a few weeks and the costs rise and you own nothing you can’t sell it for any amount of money to recoup money so it’s not an investment of any sort it’s throwing money down the drain ultimately google online diamond points sales and people are just wanting out when enough of your customer base wants out sooner or later there is a tipping point of no return reply ↓ hello to all who read this on august   we brought into diamond international resortdir in virginia beach at the discovery center at that time we purchased a  points package which we were told was more than enough point to stay during peak season in va beach just this weekend nov  we were scheduled to go back for our first orientation to see how the program worked when we sat down with the first representative tino piazzola he told us that we have a problem…how were we able to buy  points when they start at  point red flag automatically went up we replied they was sold to us by the vp of dir introduced to us as tony milazzo tino piazzola got up from the table and went an got another rep who was identified as the manager above him eric last name unknown we explained to eric the same scenario…eric then went and got another rep who was introduced to us as mike hill neither of those managers did not provide any help after that another manager who was introduced as james swetson second to the vp he stated that the packages do not go lower than  points all four reps agreed that we was under sold our vacation package but they could not do anything about it the only resolve they offered was to contact corporate or to purchase additional points however purchasing additional points meant we had to triple the additional points needed to stay during peak season if the correct package was presented in the beginning this would not be an issue you would think with all theses managers and vp someone should have the authority to correct a mistake made by dir instead we continuously got the run around a  minute presentation turned into  hours with no help from any of them the time we sat in the discovery center listening to sell pitch after sell pitch giving to different visitors throughout the center they falsely being lead to believe in dir just a way of making the quota bottom line is this…what ever happen to service before self i was lead to belief in dir and mislead by the vp of the company we even asked for help to register our account no one knew what to do and the response we got was that’s not my job sorry to say to you mr ceo david palmer at your virginia beach location you have a group of incompetent people working at that location reply ↓ the management at diamond resorts are absolutely crooked they pay off legislatures to remain in business the government need to step in and straighten it our before more innocent victims get screwed out of ’s of thousands of dollars over the past  or  years most of the timeshare companies have taken actions to make the timeshare or points you buy absolutely worthless as soon as the grace period of  days is over so the  or  goes to absolute zero value in  days you will even have to pay someone to take it from you if you have to get a loan the screwing is much more terrible the agreements you sign to get these investments are also worthless and you have to sue them to live up to them figure  for lawyer fees the rules you are supposed to follow change on a daily basis renting out your point or timeshare week that are in some old contracts are no prohibited and their response it to cancel any open reservations they will then take back your points or timeshare and resell it for  or  dollars a point to some other sucker they should be put in jail for a long time reply ↓ through ebay and and timeshare rental sites i have been able to stay in many  or  bedroom condos for spring and summer vacation for weeks at a time for a fraction of what many “owners” are charged for their annual maintenance fees i have been doing so successfully for the last  years i have stayed in condos in cancun mx florida keys orlando fl destin fl myrtle beach sc gatlinburg tn hot springs ar branson mo  ozarks french lick in etc sometimes multiple times at each destination and always when i wanted to regardless of “peak” or “offpeak” seasonal conditions – spring and summer breaks and always via rental i am not currently nor have i ever been a timeshare owner oftentimes the weekly rates averaged less than week and most frequently were for two bedroom untis although occasionally i have also opted for  bedroom or even studios apts for my family of four as an example this spring break i am staying at the diamond resort mystic dunes for  nights in a  bedroom condo for which i paid  on ebay so that works out to about night i do not know how the timeshare business stays afloat as even the cheapest motel  in kissimmee is night not to mention hotel  sales taxes etc i have attended any number of timeshare presentations but at this point with all of the options available to me including now air bnb why would i ever pay for a timeshare or a deed i am wondering when the “house of cards” that is the timeshare industry finally collapses under it’s own weight and the abuse of it’s owners in the mean time those unfortunate owners who have grossly overpaid for deeds have helped subsidize many of my family’s vacations by virtue of the resale of excess or unused inventory thank you timeshare owners one and all reply ↓ leave a reply cancel reply your email address

decreased  million or  to  million for the second quarter of  this period included  million of expenses primarily incurred in connection with the strategic review that resulted in the execution of the merger agreement we compute adjusted ebitda for debt covenant measurement purposes on june   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with affiliates of certain funds the apollo funds managed by affiliates of apollo global management llc together with its consolidated subsidiaries apollo nyse apo pursuant to which the apollo funds will acquire diamond resorts for  per share or approximately  billion subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement the acquisition this transaction is expected to close in the fall of  correction in application of relative sales value model in the accounting for vacation interests cost of sales restatement of certain prior financial statements as previously reported in connection with its review of the companys second quarter  financial statements the companys independent registered public accounting firm bdo usa llp expressed the view that the company may not have correctly applied the relative sales value inventory valuation model in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for  and subsequent periods in light of this the company reevaluated its accounting treatment of its us collections under the relative sales value method and management has now determined that a change related to the companys internal vacation interests inventory management strategy in  should have been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate under applicable accounting standards as a result the company has restated certain of its historical consolidated financial statements and other financial information to reflect its correction in the application of the relative sales value model in accounting for vacation interests cost of sales the restatement as reflected in amendments to the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   and quarterly reports on form q for the quarters ended september   and march   collectively the amendments for further information see the companys current report on form k and the amendments filed by the company contemporaneously with this release as indicated in the restated financial statements the change resulted in an increase in net income of  million for the year ended december   and decreases in net income of  million for the year ended december   and  million for the quarter ended march   in each case from amounts originally reported the change in accounting treatment was noncash in nature and because vacation interests cost of sales is not included in the computation of adjusted ebitda under the companys credit agreements the change did not impact adjusted ebitda nor did the change impact compliance with financial covenants under the companys credit agreements the impact of the restatement on the companys operating results for the periods presented in this release other than the three months ended june   for which financial information is not being restated is reflected in the tables
