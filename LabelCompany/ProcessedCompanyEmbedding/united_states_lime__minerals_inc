am image source getty images sleepy materials maker us lime  minerals nasdaquslm reported another quiet quarter that is after increasing demand for the companys core lime and limestone products led to midsingledigit growth on both the top and bottom lines while weak commodity prices continue to weigh down the companys energysensitive revenues it is more than making up for it with stronger demand from other customer segments us lime results the raw numbers metric  q  actuals q  actuals growth yoy revenue  million  million  net income  million  million  earnings per share    data source us lime  minerals yoy  year over year what happened with us lime this quarter  environmental and roof shingle customers picked up the slack this quarter the companys core lime and limestone operations continue to do the heavy lifting revenue was up  to  million on increased sales volumes to environmental and roof shingle customers which offset reduced demand from oil and gas customers that said while demand was up pricing was somewhat lower from the yearago quarter meanwhile revenue from the companys natural gas interests finally stopped plunging overall revenue was basically flat at  million while production declined from  mcf to  mcf the average price increased from  per mcf to  per mcf gross profit in the companys lime and limestone operations rose from  million to  million while gross profit from its natural gas segment edged up as well what management had to say  ceo timothy byrne commented on the quarter by saying we are pleased that overall demand for our lime and limestone products increased in the third quarter  although pricing remains a challenge in the current competitive environment byrne laments that us lime does not have much pricing power in the current environment that said while aggregate producing rivals vulcan materials nysevmc and martin marietta materials nysemlm have yet to report their thirdquarter results both have pushed through price increases this year in vulcans case its aggregates shipments expanded  during the second quarter while aggregates pricing rose  martin marietta likewise saw a  increase in aggregates pricing in the second quarter on  volume growth these higher prices could be due to their much larger scale which provides greater diversity of product type and more pricing power looking forward  while us lime did not offer any forward guidance in its earnings release we can look at what rivals are saying to get an idea of what to expect for example martin mariettas ceo ward nye said last quarter that his company remains highly optimistic as we look toward the second half of the year and well beyond likewise tom hill ceo of vulcan materials said last quarter that the fundamentals of our aggregatesfocused business remain attractive which reinforced his confidence in the outlook for both  and the longer term given that us limes thirdquarter results did not disappoint this would imply that like its rivals it should continue to see steady growth in the quarters ahead matt dilallo has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends us lime and minerals try any of our

jul   at am us lime  minerals nasdaquslm continues to benefit from a rebound in oil and gas prices not only is it fueling demand for its lime and limestone products but those higher prices are also

to  million thanks to a rebound in sales to both construction and oil and gas services customers however one of the drivers of the yearoveryear improvement in demand from construction customers is that heavy rain negatively affected last years second quarter the company also benefited from slightly higher realized prices for its lime and limestone products higher natural gas prices drove a  increase in revenue from its natural gas interests overall the company realized  more for its gas in the quarter which enabled it to overcome a  drop in volumes resulting from the natural decline of production those dual fuels helped drive profit growth for the company overall its lime and limestone operations reported  million in gross profit for the quarter up from  million in the yearago period meanwhile gross profit in its natural gas interests rose to  million which reversed a yearago loss of  million what management had to say  ceo timothy byrne commented on the companys secondquarter results we are pleased that our secondquarter  revenues and operating results improved over last years second quarter as our lime and limestone operations continued to see a rebound in demand from our oil and gas services customers as well as increased demand from our construction customers last year at this time the companys customers were battling heavy rain and weak oil and gas prices which muted demand however with those headwinds abating this year customers were able to get back to work which drove up demand for us limes products looking forward  despite the good news the improving demand in the oil patch might start fading later this year because of the slump in oil prices over the past few months in fact according to leading oilfield service company halliburton nysehal us drillers are already tapping on the brakes while halliburton doesnt expect drilling activities to decline it does see the rig count showing signs of plateauing that suggests that us limes

lime  minerals incs q results the lime and limestone product maker continued to benefit from both higher limestone sales to oil and gas services customers and the impact that improving gas prices has on its natural gas interests matthew dilallo tmfmd jul   at am us lime  minerals nasdaquslm continues to benefit from a rebound in oil and gas prices not only is it fueling demand for its lime and limestone products but those higher prices are also providing a boost to the profitability of its natural gas interests us lime results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear change revenue  million  million  net income  million  million  eps    data source us lime  minerals image source getty images what happened with us lime this quarter  demand picked up in the second quarter revenue from the companys lime and limestone operations jumped  to  million thanks to a rebound in sales to both construction and oil and gas services customers however one of the drivers of the yearoveryear improvement in demand from construction customers is that heavy rain negatively affected last years second quarter the company also benefited from slightly higher realized prices for its lime and limestone products higher natural gas prices drove a  increase in revenue from its natural gas interests overall the company realized  more for its gas in the quarter which enabled it to overcome a  drop in volumes resulting from the natural decline of production those dual fuels helped drive profit growth for the company overall its lime and limestone operations reported  million in gross profit for the quarter up from  million in the yearago period meanwhile gross profit in its natural gas interests rose to  million which reversed a yearago loss of  million what management had to say  ceo timothy byrne commented on the companys secondquarter results we are pleased that our secondquarter  revenues and operating results improved over last years second quarter as our lime and limestone operations continued to see a rebound in demand from our oil and gas services customers as well as increased demand from our construction customers last year at this time the companys customers were battling heavy rain and weak oil and gas prices which muted demand however with those headwinds abating this year customers were able to get back to work which drove up demand for us limes products looking forward  despite the good news the improving demand in the oil patch might start fading later this year because of the slump in oil prices over the past few months in fact according to leading oilfield service company halliburton nysehal us drillers are already tapping on the brakes while halliburton doesnt expect drilling activities to decline it does see the rig count showing signs of
