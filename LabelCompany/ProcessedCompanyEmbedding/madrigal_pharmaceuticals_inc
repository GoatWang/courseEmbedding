financial condition and results of operations the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q and this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited financial statements and accompanying notes for year ended december   and the related managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations both of which are included in our annual report on form k in addition to historical information this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended or the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur for the full fiscal year or any other future period overview we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular metabolic and liver diseases our lead product candidate mgl is a proprietary liverdirected selective thyroid hormone receptor � or thr� agonist that can potentially be used to treat a number of disease states with high unmet medical need we are developing mgl for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or nash and we have initiated a phase  clinical trial in this indication we are also developing mgl for dyslipidemia particularly genetic dyslipidemias such as familial hypercholesterolemia or fh including both homozygous and heterozygous forms of the disease we have initiated a phase  clinical trial in heterozygous fh hefh patients and we are planning to conduct a proofofconcept clinical trial in homozygous fh hofh patients mgl is a oncedaily oral pill that has been studied in four completed phase  trials in a total of  subjects mgl appeared to be safe and welltolerated in these trials which included a single ascending dose trial a multiple ascending dose trial and two drug interaction trials with statins basis of presentation research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with our research activities including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates we expense our research and development expenses as incurred we contract with clinical research organizations to manage our clinical trials under agreed upon budgets for each study with oversight by our clinical program managers we account for nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received manufacturing expense includes costs associated with drug formulation development and drug production we do not track employee and facility related research and development costs by project as we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development programs we believe that the allocation of such costs would be arbitrary and not be meaningful our research and development expenses consist primarily of  external expenses paid to clinical trial sites contract research organizations laboratories database software and consultants that conduct clinical trials  expenses related to development and production of nonclinical and clinical trial supplies including fees paid to contract manufacturers  expenses related to preclinical studies  expenses related to compliance with drug development regulatory requirements and  other allocated expenses which include direct and allocated expenses for depreciation of equipment and other supplies we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our development activities for the foreseeable future as we conduct our phase  clinical program manufacturing and toxicology studies product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials additional drug manufacturing requirements and later stage toxicology studies such as carcinogenicity studies our research and development expenses increased between  and  and we table of contents expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in the future the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming the probability of success for each product candidate is affected by numerous factors including preclinical data clinical data competition manufacturing capability and commercial viability accordingly we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates completion dates and costs for our clinical development programs as well as our research program can vary significantly for each current and future product candidate and are difficult to predict as a result we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty the costs we will incur in connection with the development of our product candidates at this point in time we expect that we will make determinations as to which programs and product candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program and product candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific success of early research programs results of ongoing and future clinical trials our ability to enter into collaborative agreements with respect to programs or potential product candidates as well as ongoing assessments as to each current or future product candidates commercial potential general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of management costs costs associated with obtaining and maintaining our patent portfolio professional fees for accounting auditing consulting and legal services and allocated overhead expenses we expect that our general and administrative expenses may increase in the future as we expand our operating activities maintain and expand our patent portfolio and incur additional costs associated with being a public company and maintaining compliance with exchange listing and us securities and exchange commission or sec requirements we expect these potential increases will likely include management costs legal fees accounting fees directors and officers liability insurance premiums and expenses associated with investor relations critical accounting policies and estimates our managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and judgments including those related to accrued research and development expenses we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions there have been no significant and material changes in our critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates during the three months ended march   as compared to those disclosed in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   filed with the sec on march   results of operations three months ended march   compared with three months ended march   revenues we had no revenues for the three months ended march   and march   table of contents the following table provides comparative unaudited results of operations for the three months ended march   and  three months ended march  increase  decrease     dollars in thousands research and development expenses        general and administrative expenses      interest expense income               research and development expenses our research and development expenses were  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   research and development expenses increased in  due primarily to the expenses incurred to conduct and support the two phase  studies for mgl which commenced in the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of  respectively our increased research and development expenses include a  million increase in contract research organization costs directly associated with the two phase  studies these increases also include  million in compensation expense related to employee hiring that occurred upon and following the consummation of the merger we expect our research and development expenses to increase over time as we advance our clinical and preclinical development programs for mgl general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   the increase in general and administrative expenses in  was primarily due to a  million increase in compensation expense related to employee hiring that occurred upon and following consummation of the merger additional increases were a result of expenses related to operating a public company we believe our general and administrative expenses may increase over time as we advance our technology into clinical programs and as a result of our obligations as a public reporting company both of which will likely result in an increase in our headcount consulting services and certain overhead needed to support those efforts interest expense and income our net interest income was approximately  million and our net interest expense was  million for the three months ended march   and  respectively the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the conversion of all outstanding promissory notes to equity upon the consummation of the merger liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of  million to date we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible debt the proceeds from the merger and proceeds from sales of our common stock under our atthe market issuance agreement with cowen and company llc or the atm program we believe that our cash and cash equivalents at march   will be sufficient to fund our operations past one year from the issuance of these financial statements table of contents our primary uses of capital are and we expect will continue to be funding our research efforts and the development of our product candidates compensation and related expenses hiring additional staff including clinical scientific operational financial and management personnel and costs associated with operating as a public company we expect to incur substantial expenditures in the foreseeable future for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates we plan to continue to fund losses from operations and capital funding needs through future equity andor debt financings as well as potential additional collaborations or strategic partnerships with other companies the sale of additional equity or convertible debt could result in additional dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we can provide no assurance that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us if at all if we are not able to secure adequate additional funding we may be forced to delay make reductions in spending extend payment terms with suppliers liquidate assets where possible andor suspend or curtail planned programs any of these actions could materially harm our business cash flows the following table provides a summary of our net cash flow activity three months ended march    dollars in thousands net

operating activities was  million for the three months ended march   compared to  million for the three months ended march   the use of cash in these periods principally resulted from our losses from operations as adjusted for noncash charges for stockbased compensation and changes in our working capital accounts net cash used by investing activities was  million for the three months ended march   compared to zero for the three months ended march   net cash used by investing activities for the three months ended march   consisted of  million of purchases of marketable securities for our

source madrigal pharmaceuticals inc  pen positioned to begin clinical trials in  –  total potential payments to madrigal may exceed  million – conshohocken pa and watertown mass sept   globe newswire   madrigal pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqmdgl and tarveda therapeutics inc today announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement providing for the discovery development and commercialization by tarveda of products based on madrigal’s hsp drug conjugate program including the lead clinical candidate pen madrigal is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular metabolic and liver diseases and tarveda therapeutics inc is a biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing pentarins™ as a new class of targeted anticancer medicines to advance the treatment of patients with solid tumors hsp drug conjugates are designed to increase cancer cell killing while reducing collateral damage to normal cells and overcome the challenges of current chemotherapies and other payloads which are commonly limited by insufficient drug exposure in the tumor andor systemic toxicities hsp drug conjugates are smallmolecule conjugates consisting of an hsp targeting molecule joined to an anticancer payload via a linker that is optimized for controlled release of the payload inside cancer cells the conjugate’s sustained antitumor effect comes from selectively accumulating and retaining the conjugate and importantly its potent payload in tumors hsp drug conjugates contrast with previous hsp inhibitors that were designed to only inhibit hsp madrigal acquired the drug conjugate platform via its recent merger with synta pharmaceuticals inc the lead hsp drug conjugate pen is a smallmolecule drug conjugate that comprises an hsp ligand conjugated to sn the highlypotent active metabolite of the chemotherapeutic agent irinotecan pen binds with high affinity to the intracellular hsp target once bound to its target pen delivers the tumorkilling sn payload pen has shown an impressive degree of efficacy and durability of response in multiple preclinical tumor models including patientderived xenograft models studies demonstrate that sn released from pen accumulated at high levels within the tumors and was associated with increased and widespread cancer cell death when compared with irinotecan alone under the terms of the agreement madrigal will receive an upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to an aggregate of  million of contingent payments based upon the achievement of specified development regulatory and sales milestones related to the first hsp drug conjugate product developed under the agreement madrigal is also eligible to receive a tiered singledigit royalty based on future worldwide sales of hsp drug conjugate products  potential development regulatory and sales milestone payments related to a second hsp drug conjugate product would be lower tarveda will be responsible for all of the development costs for the hsp drug conjugate program “we are pleased to have completed this important and potentially valuable agreement with tarveda” said paul a friedman md chairman and ceo of madrigal  “this transaction is a key element of madrigal’s strategy to outlicense our novel oncology assets to organizations with the oncology focus and resources to fully exploit the opportunity for product development and commercial success” the tarveda team is comprised of seasoned oncology leaders scientists and drug developers who are taking a novel approach to cancer treatment by creating pentarins™ which are miniaturized drug conjugates uniquely designed to target penetrate and eradicate solid tumors creating pentarin drug conjugates that drive efficacy in solid tumors is the core expertise and focus of the team at tarveda “tarveda is developing therapeutics to overcome the limitations of current cancer treatments through our pentarin platform pentarins leverage their miniature size and improved pharmacokinetics to penetrate into solid tumors and cause cancer cell death with highly selective cell surface and intracellular targeting tuned linkers and potent payloads” said drew fromkin president and ceo of tarveda  “the hsp drug conjugate platform with its lead drug candidate pen which is scheduled to be in the clinic during the first half of  is an ideal fit for our growing pentarin pipeline of novel oncology therapeutics the tarveda pipeline also includes pen our pentarin conjugate that binds to the somatostatin cell surface receptor after which the conjugate’s potent payload is internalized into the cancer cell pen is scheduled to enter phase i trials this year to treat patients with neuroendocrine and smallcell lung cancer tumors we look forward to advancing both of these novel pentarin drug candidates into clinical studies in the near term and expanding the pentarin platform pipeline by developing new conjugates linked to other potent payloads including challenged but promising payloads being developed by potential pharmaceutical partners” about madrigal pharmaceuticals

patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the

phrma’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies in a new video dr bernie zeiher president of development of astellas discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient “i am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen” dr zeiher says in the video “now with more personalizedtype therapies you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond” dr zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of america’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments although there were only  fdaapproved personalized medicines in  today there are more than  additionally personalized medicines accounted for more than  percent of fda approvals last year marking a record year for these innovative therapies cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers like nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc in fact research has shown nearly twothirds of nslcs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers like dr zeiher  percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized while the science has never been more complex the future of
