the  ruby ridge incident mcveigh hoped to inspire a revolt against the federal government he was convicted of eleven federal offenses and sentenced to death his execution was carried out in a

united states army in  mcveigh grew increasingly transient at first he worked briefly near his hometown of pendleton as a security guard for pinkerton government services at calspan in cheektowaga where he spoke daily to his coworker carl lebron jr about his loathing for government deciding the buffalo area was too liberal he left his job and began driving around the country seeking out his old friends from the army mcveigh wrote letters to local newspapers complaining about taxes taxes are a joke regardless of what a political candidate promises they will increase more taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement they mess up we suffer taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels with no slowdown in sight  is a civil war imminent do we have to shed blood to reform the current system i hope it doesnt come to that but it might mcveigh also wrote to representative john j lafalce d new york complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace it is a lie if we tell ourselves that the police can protect us everywhere at all times firearms restrictions are bad enough but now a woman cant even carry mace in her purse while visiting friends in decker michigan mcveigh

to the government inviting them to go ahead take everything i own take my dignity feel good as you grow fat and rich at my expense sucking my tax dollars and property mcveigh introduced his sister to antigovernment literature but his father had little interest in these views he moved out of his fathers house and into an apartment that had no telephone which had the advantage of making it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments he also quit the nra viewing its stance on gun rights as too weak  waco siege and gun showsedit in  he drove to waco texas during the waco siege to show his support at the scene he distributed progun rights literature and bumper stickers such as when guns are outlawed i will become an outlaw he told a student reporter the government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times once you take away the guns you can do anything to the people you give them an inch and they take a mile i believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government the government is continually growing bigger and more powerful and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control for the five months following the waco siege mcveigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed up with lon horiuchis name and address in the hope that somebody in the patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter horiuchi is an fbi sniper and some of his official actions have drawn controversy specifically his shooting and killing of randy weavers wife while she held an infant child he wrote hate mail to the sniper suggesting that what goes around comes around mcveigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the murrah building to target horiuchi or a member of his family instead mcveigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows mcveigh found that the further west he went the more antigovernment sentiment he encountered at least until he got to what he called the peoples socialist republic of california mcveigh sold survival items and copies of the turner diaries one author said in the gun show culture mcveigh found a home though he remained skeptical of some of the most extreme ideas being bandied around he liked talking to people there about the united nations the

buying property in seligman arizona which he determined to be in a nuclearfree zone mcveigh lived with michael fortier in kingman arizona and they became so close that he served as best man at fortiers wedding mcveigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia however he was never as interested in drugs as fortier was one of the reasons they parted ways was mcveighs boredom with fortiers drug habits with nichols waco siege radicalization and first explosive devicesedit in april  mcveigh headed for a farm in michigan where terry nichols lived in between watching coverage of the waco siege on tv nichols and his brother began teaching mcveigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials specifically they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs the destruction of the waco compound enraged mcveigh and convinced him that it was time to take action the governments use of cs gas on women and children angered mcveigh he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects the disappearance of certain evidence such as the bulletriddled steelreinforced front door to the complex led him to suspect a coverup mcveighs antigovernment rhetoric became more radical he began to sell bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf hats riddled with bullet holes and a flare gun which he said could shoot down an atf helicopter he produced videos detailing the governments actions at waco and handed out pamphlets with titles like us government initiates open warfare against american people and waco shootout evokes memory of warsaw  he began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by patrick henry such as give me liberty or give me death he began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices the government also imposed new firearms restrictions in  that mcveigh believed threatened his livelihood mcveigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend steve hodge by sending him a page farewell letter he proclaimed his devotion to the united states declaration of independence explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him mcveigh declared that those who betray or subvert the constitution are guilty of sedition andor treason are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly it also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty i have sworn to uphold and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and i will and i will because not only did i swear to but i believe in what it stands for in every bit of my heart soul and being i know in my heart that i am right in my struggle steve i have come to peace with myself my god and my cause blood will flow in the streets steve good vs evil free men vs socialist wannabe slaves pray it is not your blood my friend mcveigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies he visited area  in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to gulfport mississippi to determine the veracity of rumors about united nations operations these turned out to be false the russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in unsponsored humanitarian aid efforts around this time mcveigh and nichols also began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer for resale to survivalists since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it plan against federal building or individualsedit mcveigh told fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building but fortier declined to participate fortier also told his wife about the plans mcveigh composed two letters to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the first titled constitutional defenders and the second atf read he denounced government officials as fascist tyrants and storm troopers and warned atf all you tyrannical people will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the constitution of the united states remember the nuremberg war trials mcveigh also wrote a letter of recruitment to a customer named steve colbern a man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energyanger can be focused toward a commonrighteous goal what im asking you to do then is sit back and be honest with yourself do you have kidswife would you back out at the last minute to care for the family are you interested in keeping your firearms for their currentfuture monetary value or would you drag that  through rock swamp and cactus to get off the needed shot in short im not looking for talkers im looking for fighters and if you are a fed think twice think twice about the constitution you are supposedly enforcing isnt enforcing freedom an oxymoron and think twice about catching us with our guard down – you will lose just like degan did – and your family will lose mcveigh began announcing that he had progressed from the propaganda phase to the action phase he wrote to his michigan friend gwenda strider i have certain other militant talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded mcveigh later said he considered a campaign of individual assassination with eligible targets including attorneygeneral janet reno judge walter s smith jr of federal district court who handled the branch davidian trial and lon horiuchi a member of the fbi hostagerescue team who shot and killed vicki weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at ruby ridge idaho in  he said he wanted reno to accept full responsibility in deed not just words such an assassination seemed too difficult and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers according to mcveighs authorized biography he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building after the bombing he was ambivalent about his act as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead oklahoma city bombingedit main article oklahoma city bombing the alfred p murrah federal building two days after the oklahoma city bombing working at a lakeside campground near mcveighs old army post he and nichols constructed an annm explosive device mounted in the back of a rented ryder truck the bomb consisted of about  pounds  kg of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane on april   mcveigh drove the truck to the front of the alfred p murrah federal building just as its offices opened for the day before arriving he stopped to light a twominute fuse at  a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building it killed  people including nineteen children in the day care center on the second floor and injured  others mcveigh said that he had no knowledge that the federal offices also ran a daycare center on the second floor of the building and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it nichols disputed this saying that he and mcveigh knew there was a daycare center in the building and that they did not care mcveighs biographers lou michel and dan herbeck quote mcveigh with whom they spoke for  hours on his attitude to the victims to these people in oklahoma who have lost a loved one im sorry but it happens every day youre not the first mother to lose a kid or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter it happens every day somewhere in the world im not going to go into that courtroom curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that during an interview with ed bradley for television news magazine  minutes in  bradley asked mcveigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children mcveigh stated i thought it was terrible that there were children in the building according to the oklahoma city memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism mipt more than  buildings were damaged more than  volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue recovery and support operations following the bombing in reference to theories that he had assistance from others mcveigh quoted a well known line from the film a few good men you cant handle the truth and added because the truth is i blew up the murrah building and isnt it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell arrest trial conviction and sentencingedit fbi forensic sketch of mcveigh and his fbi mugshot by tracing the vehicle identification number vin of a rear axle found in the wreckage the fbi identified the vehicle as a ryder rental box truck rented from junction city kansas workers at the agency assisted an fbi artist in creating a sketch of the renter who had used the alias robert kling the sketch was shown in the area lea mcgown manager of the local dreamland motel identified the sketch as timothy mcveigh shortly after the bombing while driving on i in noble county near perry oklahoma mcveigh was stopped by oklahoma state trooper charles j hanger hanger had passed mcveighs yellow  mercury marquis and noticed that it had no license plate mcveigh admitted to the police officer who noticed a bulge under his jacket that he had a gun and mcveigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession mcveighs concealed weapon permit was not legal in oklahoma mcveigh was wearing a tshirt at that time with a picture of abraham lincoln and the motto sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants the supposed words shouted by john wilkes booth after he shot lincoln on the back it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the thomas jefferson quote the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants three days later while still in jail mcveigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt mcveigh about to be led out of a perry oklahoma courthouse two days after the oklahoma city bombing on august   mcveigh was indicted on eleven federal counts including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction use of a weapon of mass destruction destruction with the use of explosives and eight counts of firstdegree murder on february   the court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from oklahoma city to the us district court in denver colorado to be presided over by us district judge richard paul matsch mcveigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense but they ended up not doing so because they would have had to prove that mcveigh was in imminent danger from the government mcveigh himself argued that imminent did not necessarily mean immediate they would have argued that his bombing of the murrah building was a justifiable response to what mcveigh believed were the crimes of the us government at waco texas where the day siege of the branch davidian complex resulted in the deaths of  branch davidians as part of the defense mcveighs lawyers showed the jury the controversial video waco the big lie on june   mcveigh was found guilty on all eleven counts of the federal indictment after the verdict mcveigh tried to calm his mother by saying think of it this way when i was in the army you didnt see me for years think of me that way now like im away in the army again on an assignment for the military on june   the jury recommended that mcveigh receive the death penalty the us department of justice brought federal charges against mcveigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for mcveigh they could not bring charges against mcveigh for the remaining  murders in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the state of oklahoma because mcveigh was convicted and sentenced to death the state of oklahoma did not file murder charges against mcveigh for the other  deaths before the sentence was formally pronounced by judge matsch mcveigh addressed the court for the first time and said if the court please i wish to use the words of justice brandeis dissenting in olmstead to speak for me he wrote our government is the potent the omnipresent teacher for good or for ill it teaches the whole people by its example thats all i have incarceration and executionedit florence admax usp where mcveigh was incarcerated while imprisoned mcveigh had the federal bureau of prisons bop register number  mcveighs death sentence was delayed pending an appeal one of his appeals for certiorari taken to the supreme court of the united states was denied on march   mcveighs request for a nationally televised execution was also denied an internet company also unsuccessfully sued for the right to broadcast it at adx florence mcveigh and nichols were housed in bombers row the same cell block as ted kaczynski luis felipe and ramzi yousef yousef made frequent unsuccessful attempts to convert mcveigh to islam mcveigh said i am sorry these people had to lose their lives but thats the nature of the beast its understood going in what the human toll will be he said that if there turned out to be an afterlife he would improvise adapt and overcome noting if there is a hell then ill be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war he also said i knew i wanted this before it happened i knew my objective was stateassisted suicide and when it happens its in your face you just did something youre trying to say should be illegal for medical personnel united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana the site of the federal death row for men and the federal execution chamber death certificate of timothy mcveigh the bop transferred mcveigh from adx florence to the federal death row at united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana in  mcveigh dropped his remaining appeals saying that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison on january   the federal bureau of prisons set may   as mcveighs execution date mcveigh stated that his only regret was not completely leveling the federal building six days prior to his scheduled execution the fbi turned over thousands of documents of evidence it had previously withheld to mcveighs attorneys as a result us attorney general john ashcroft announced mcveighs execution would be stayed for one month the execution date was reset for june   mcveigh invited california conductorcomposer david woodard to perform prerequiem mass music on the eve of his execution he requested a catholic chaplain he requested two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream for his last meal mcveigh chose william ernest henleys poem invictus as his final statement just before the execution when he was asked if he had a final statement he declined jay sawyer a relative of one of the victims wrote without saying a word he got the final word larry whicher whose brother died in the attack described mcveigh as having a totally expressionless blank stare he had a look of defiance and that if he could hed do it all over again mcveigh was executed by lethal injection at  am on june   at the us federal penitentiary in terre haute indiana the first federal prisoner to be executed by the united states federal government since victor feguer was executed in iowa on march   on november   president bill clinton had signed s  special legislation introduced by senator arlen specter to bar mcveigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery his body was cremated at mattox ryan funeral home in terre haute his ashes were given to his lawyer who said that the final destination of mcveighs remains would remain privileged forever mcveigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood but decided that would be too vengeful too raw too cold he had expressed willingness to donate organs but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations psychiatrist john smith concluded that mcveigh was a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible violent act mcveighs iq was assessed at  associationsedit according to cnn his only known associations were as a registered republican while in buffalo new york in the s and a membership in the national rifle association while in the army and there is no evidence that he ever belonged to any extremist groups religious beliefsedit mcveigh was raised roman catholic during his childhood he and his father attended mass regularly mcveigh was confirmed at the good shepherd church in pendleton new york in  in a  interview mcveigh professed belief in a god although he said he had sort of lost touch with catholicism and i never really picked it up however i do maintain core beliefs in mcveighs biography american terrorist released in  he stated that he did not believe in a hell and that science is his religion in june  a day before the execution mcveigh wrote a letter to the buffalo news identifying himself as agnostic however he took the last rites administered by a priest just before his execution father charles smith ministered to mcveigh in his last moments in death row motivations for the bombingedit why mcveigh told us at eloquent length but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic crazed monster  who had done it for the kicks —gore vidal  mcveigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at waco texas and ruby ridge mcveigh visited waco during the standoff while there he was interviewed by student reporter michelle rauch a senior journalism major at southern methodist university who was writing for the school paper mcveigh expressed his objections over what was happening there  mcveigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel the turner diaries he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms photocopies of pages sixtyone and sixtytwo of the turner diaries were found in an envelope inside mcveighs car these pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the us capitol in washington in a word essay dated march  from the federal maximumsecurity prison at florence colorado mcveigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was morally equivalent to us military actions against iraq and other foreign countries the handwritten essay submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine media bypass was distributed worldwide by the associated press on may   this was written in the midst of the  iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before operation desert fox the administration has said that iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons weapons of mass destruction — mainly because they have used them in the past well if thats the standard by which these matters are decided then the us is the nation that set the precedent the us has stockpiled these same weapons and more for over  years the us claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its cold war with the soviet union why then it is invalid for iraq to claim the same reason deterrence with respect to iraqs real war with and the continued threat of its neighbor iran the administration claims that iraq has used these weapons in the past weve all seen the pictures that show a kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons but have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from hiroshima or nagasaki i suggest that one study the histories of world war i world war ii and other regional conflicts that the us has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of weapons of mass destruction remember dresden how about hanoi tripoli baghdad what about the big ones — hiroshima and nagasaki at these two locations the us killed at least  noncombatants — mostly women and children — in the blink of an eye thousands more took hours days weeks or months to die if saddam is such a demon and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of mass destruction — like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above the truth is the us has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction the essay which marked the first time that mcveigh publicly discussed the oklahoma city bombing continued hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children in oklahoma city it was family convenience that explained the presence of a daycare center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building yet when discussion shifts to iraq any daycare center in a government building instantly becomes a shield think about it when considering morality and mens rea criminal intent in light of these facts i ask who are the true barbarians  i find it ironic to say the least that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on iraq is dubbed the spirit of oklahoma this leads me to a final and unspoken moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction when a us plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise what a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake unfortunately the morality of killing is not so superficial the truth is the use of a truck a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself these are weapons of mass destruction — and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons whether you wish to admit it or not when you approve morally of the bombing of foreign targets by the us military you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in oklahoma city  mcveigh included photocopies of a famous vietnam warera picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs and of nuclear devastation in japan he said in a preface that the essay was intended to provoke thought — and was not written with malevolent intent on april   mcveigh wrote a letter to fox news i explain herein why i bombed the murrah federal building in oklahoma city which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack mcveigh read unintended consequences and said that if it had come out a few years earlier he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building accomplicesedit mcveighs accomplice terry nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime at nichols trial evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved several residents of central kansas including real estate agent georgia rucker and a retired army nco testified at terry nichols federal trial that they had seen two trucks at geary lake state park where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled the retired nco said he visited the lake on april   but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively the operator of the dreamland motel testified that two ryder trucks had been parked outside her grandview plaza motel where mcveigh stayed in room  the weekend before the bombing terry nichols is incarcerated at adx florence in florence colorado an atf informant carol howe told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of elohim city oklahoma were planning a major bombing attack mcveigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time other than this speeding ticket there is no evidence of a connection between mcveigh and members of the midwest bank robbers at elohim city in february  the fbi announced it would review its investigation after learning that agents in the investigation of the midwest bank robbers an alleged aryanoriented gang had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger the oklahoma city bomb agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the midwest bank robbers investigation mcveigh declined further delays and maintained until his death that he had acted alone in the bombing some witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect and there was a search for a john doe  but none was ever found see alsoedit united states

increase more taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement they mess up we suffer taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels with no slowdown in sight  is a civil war imminent do we have to shed blood to reform the current system i hope it doesnt come to that but it might mcveigh also wrote to representative john j lafalce d new york complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace

began looking for a state without heavy government regulation or high taxes he became enraged when the government told him that he had been overpaid  while in the army and he had to pay back the money he wrote an angry letter to the government inviting them to go ahead take everything i own take my dignity feel good as you grow fat and rich at my expense sucking my tax dollars and property mcveigh introduced his sister to antigovernment literature but his father had little interest in these views he moved out of his fathers house and into an apartment that had no telephone which had the advantage of making it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments he also quit the nra viewing its stance on gun rights as too weak  waco siege and gun showsedit in  he drove to waco texas during the waco siege to show his support at the scene he distributed progun rights literature and bumper stickers such as when guns are outlawed i will become an outlaw he told a student reporter the government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times once you take away the guns you can do anything to the people you give them an inch and they take a mile i believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government the government is continually growing bigger and more powerful and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control for the five months following the waco siege mcveigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed up with lon horiuchis name and address in the hope that somebody in the patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter horiuchi is an fbi sniper and some of his official actions have drawn controversy specifically his shooting and killing of randy weavers wife while she held an infant child he wrote hate mail to the sniper suggesting that what goes around comes around mcveigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the murrah building to target horiuchi or a member of his family instead mcveigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows mcveigh found that the further west he went the more antigovernment sentiment he encountered at least until he got to what he called the peoples socialist republic of california mcveigh sold survival items and copies of the turner diaries one author said in the gun show culture mcveigh found a home though he remained skeptical of some of the most extreme ideas being bandied around he liked talking to people there about the

attacks and considered buying property in seligman arizona which he determined to be in a nuclearfree zone mcveigh lived with michael fortier in kingman arizona and they became so close that he served as best man at fortiers wedding mcveigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia however he was never as interested in drugs as fortier was one of the reasons they parted ways was mcveighs boredom with fortiers drug habits with nichols waco siege radicalization and first explosive devicesedit in april  mcveigh headed for a farm in michigan where terry nichols lived in between watching coverage of the waco siege on tv nichols and his brother began teaching mcveigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials specifically they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs the destruction of the waco compound enraged mcveigh and convinced him that it was time to take action the governments use of cs gas on women and children angered mcveigh he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects the disappearance of certain evidence such as the bulletriddled steelreinforced front door to the complex led him to suspect a coverup mcveighs antigovernment rhetoric became more radical he began to sell bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf hats riddled with bullet holes and a flare gun which he said could shoot down an atf helicopter he produced videos detailing the governments actions at waco and handed out pamphlets with titles like us government initiates open warfare against american people and waco shootout evokes memory of warsaw  he began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by patrick henry such as give me liberty or give me death he began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices the government also imposed new firearms restrictions in  that mcveigh believed threatened his livelihood mcveigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend steve hodge by sending him a page farewell letter he proclaimed his devotion to the united states declaration of independence explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him mcveigh declared that those who betray or subvert the constitution are guilty of sedition andor treason are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly it also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty i have sworn to uphold and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and i will and i will because not only did i swear to but i believe in what it stands for in every bit of my heart soul and being i know in my heart that i am right in my struggle steve i have come to peace with myself my god and my cause blood will flow in the streets steve good vs evil free men vs socialist wannabe slaves pray it is not your blood my friend mcveigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies he visited area  in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to gulfport mississippi to determine the veracity of rumors about united nations operations these turned out to be false the russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in unsponsored humanitarian aid efforts around this time mcveigh and nichols also began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer for resale to survivalists since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it plan against federal building or individualsedit mcveigh told fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building but fortier declined to participate fortier also told his wife about the plans mcveigh composed two letters to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the first titled constitutional defenders and the second atf read he denounced government officials as fascist tyrants and storm troopers and warned atf all you tyrannical people will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the constitution of the united states remember the nuremberg war trials mcveigh also wrote a letter of recruitment to a customer named steve colbern a man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energyanger can be focused toward a commonrighteous goal what im asking you to do then is sit back and be honest with yourself do you have kidswife would you back out at the last minute to care for the family are you interested in keeping your firearms for their currentfuture monetary value or would you drag that  through rock swamp and cactus to get off the needed shot in short im not looking for talkers im looking for fighters and if you are a fed think twice think twice about the constitution you are supposedly enforcing isnt enforcing freedom an oxymoron and think twice about catching us with our guard down – you will lose just like degan did – and your family will lose mcveigh began announcing that he had progressed from the propaganda phase to the action phase he wrote to his michigan friend gwenda strider i have certain other militant talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded mcveigh later said he considered a campaign of individual assassination with eligible targets including attorneygeneral janet reno judge walter s smith jr of federal district court who handled the branch davidian trial and lon horiuchi a member of the fbi hostagerescue team who shot and killed vicki weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at ruby ridge idaho in  he said he wanted reno to accept full responsibility in deed not just words such an assassination seemed too difficult and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers according to mcveighs authorized biography he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building after the bombing he was ambivalent about his act as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead oklahoma city bombingedit main article oklahoma city bombing the alfred p murrah federal building two days after the oklahoma city bombing working at a lakeside campground near mcveighs old army post he and nichols constructed an annm explosive device mounted in the back of a rented ryder truck the bomb consisted of about  pounds  kg of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane on april   mcveigh drove the truck to the front of the alfred p murrah federal building just as its offices opened for the day before arriving he stopped to light a twominute fuse at  a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building it killed  people including nineteen children in the day care center on the second floor and injured  others mcveigh said that he had no knowledge that the federal offices also ran a daycare center on the second floor of the building and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it nichols disputed this saying that he and mcveigh knew there was a daycare center in the building and that they did not care mcveighs biographers lou michel and dan herbeck quote mcveigh with whom they spoke for  hours on his attitude to the victims to these people in oklahoma who have lost a loved one im sorry but it happens every day youre not the first mother to lose a kid or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter it happens every day somewhere in the world im not going to go into that courtroom curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that during an interview with ed bradley for television news magazine  minutes in  bradley asked mcveigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children mcveigh stated i thought it was terrible that there were children in the building according to the oklahoma city memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism mipt more than  buildings were damaged more than  volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue recovery and support operations following the bombing in reference to theories that he had assistance from others mcveigh quoted a well known line from the film a few good men you cant handle the truth and added because the truth is i blew up the murrah building and isnt it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell arrest trial conviction and sentencingedit fbi forensic sketch of mcveigh and his fbi mugshot by tracing the vehicle identification number vin of a rear axle found in the wreckage the fbi identified the vehicle as a ryder rental box truck rented from junction city kansas workers at the agency assisted an fbi artist in creating a sketch of the renter who had used the alias robert kling the sketch was shown in the area lea mcgown manager of the local dreamland motel identified the sketch as timothy mcveigh shortly after the bombing while driving on i in noble county near perry oklahoma mcveigh was stopped by oklahoma state trooper charles j hanger hanger had passed mcveighs yellow  mercury marquis and noticed that it had no license plate mcveigh admitted to the police officer who noticed a bulge under his jacket that he had a gun and mcveigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession mcveighs concealed weapon permit was not legal in oklahoma mcveigh was wearing a tshirt at that time with a picture of abraham lincoln and the motto sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants the supposed words shouted by john wilkes booth after he shot lincoln on the back it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the thomas jefferson quote the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants three days later while still in jail mcveigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt mcveigh about to be led out of a perry oklahoma courthouse two days after the oklahoma city bombing on august   mcveigh was indicted on eleven federal counts including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction use of a weapon of mass destruction destruction with the use of explosives and eight counts of firstdegree murder on february   the court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from oklahoma city to the us district court in denver colorado to be presided over by us district judge richard paul matsch mcveigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense but they ended up not doing so because they would have had to prove that mcveigh was in imminent danger from the government mcveigh himself argued that imminent did not necessarily mean immediate they would have argued that his bombing of the murrah building was a justifiable response to what mcveigh believed were the crimes of the us government at waco texas where the day siege of the branch davidian complex resulted in the deaths of  branch davidians as part of the defense mcveighs lawyers showed the jury the controversial video waco the big lie on june   mcveigh was found guilty on all eleven counts of the federal indictment after the verdict mcveigh tried to calm his mother by saying think of it this way when i was in the army you didnt see me for years think of me that way now like im away in the army again on an assignment for the military on june   the jury recommended that mcveigh receive the death penalty the us department of justice brought federal charges against mcveigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for mcveigh they could not bring charges against mcveigh for the remaining  murders in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the state of oklahoma because mcveigh was convicted and sentenced to death the state of oklahoma did not file murder charges against mcveigh for the other  deaths before the sentence was formally pronounced by judge matsch mcveigh addressed the court for the first time and said if the court please i wish to use the words of justice brandeis dissenting in olmstead to speak for me he wrote our government is the potent the omnipresent teacher for good or for ill it teaches the whole people by its example thats all i have incarceration and executionedit florence admax usp where mcveigh was incarcerated while imprisoned mcveigh had the federal bureau of prisons bop register number  mcveighs death sentence was delayed pending an appeal one of his appeals for certiorari taken to the supreme court of the united states was denied on march   mcveighs request for a nationally televised execution was also denied an internet company also unsuccessfully sued for the right to broadcast it at adx florence mcveigh and nichols were housed in bombers row the same cell block as ted kaczynski luis felipe and ramzi yousef yousef made frequent unsuccessful attempts to convert mcveigh to islam mcveigh said i am sorry these people had to lose their lives but thats the nature of the beast its understood going in what the human toll will be he said that if there turned out to be an afterlife he would improvise adapt and overcome noting if there is a hell then ill be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war he also said i knew i wanted this before it happened i knew my objective was stateassisted suicide and when it happens its in your face you just did something youre trying to say should be illegal for medical personnel united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana the site of the federal death row for men and the federal execution chamber death certificate of timothy mcveigh the bop transferred mcveigh from adx florence to the federal death row at united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana in  mcveigh dropped his remaining appeals saying that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison on january   the federal bureau of prisons set may   as mcveighs execution date mcveigh stated that his only regret was not completely leveling the federal building six days prior to his scheduled execution the fbi turned over thousands of documents of evidence it had previously withheld to mcveighs attorneys as a result us attorney general john ashcroft announced mcveighs execution would be stayed for one month the execution date was reset for june   mcveigh invited california conductorcomposer david woodard to perform prerequiem mass music on the eve of his execution he requested a catholic chaplain he requested two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream for his last meal mcveigh chose william ernest henleys poem invictus as his final statement just before the execution when he was asked if he had a final statement he declined jay sawyer a relative of one of the victims wrote without saying a word he got the final word larry whicher whose brother died in the attack described mcveigh as having a totally expressionless blank stare he had a look of defiance and that if he could hed do it all over again mcveigh was executed by lethal injection at  am on june   at the us federal penitentiary in terre haute indiana the first federal prisoner to be executed by the united states federal government since victor feguer was executed in iowa on march   on november   president bill clinton had signed s  special legislation introduced by senator arlen specter to bar mcveigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery his body was cremated at mattox ryan funeral home in terre haute his ashes were given to his lawyer who said that the final destination of mcveighs remains would remain privileged forever mcveigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood but decided that would be too vengeful too raw too cold he had expressed willingness to donate organs but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations psychiatrist john smith concluded that mcveigh was a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible violent act mcveighs iq was assessed at  associationsedit according to cnn his only known associations were as a registered republican while in buffalo new york in the s and a membership in the national rifle association while in the army and there is no evidence that he ever belonged to any extremist groups religious beliefsedit mcveigh was raised roman catholic during his childhood he and his father attended mass regularly mcveigh was confirmed at the good shepherd church in pendleton new york in  in a  interview mcveigh professed belief in a god although he said he had sort of lost touch with catholicism and i never really picked it up however i do maintain core beliefs in mcveighs biography american terrorist released in  he stated that he did not believe in a hell and that science is his religion in june  a day before the execution mcveigh wrote a letter to the buffalo news identifying himself as agnostic however he took the last rites administered by a priest just before his execution father charles smith ministered to mcveigh in his last moments in death row motivations for the bombingedit why mcveigh told us at eloquent length but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic crazed monster  who had done it for the kicks —gore vidal  mcveigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at waco texas and ruby ridge mcveigh visited waco during the standoff while there he was interviewed by student reporter michelle rauch a senior journalism major at southern methodist university who was writing for the school paper mcveigh expressed his objections over what was happening there  mcveigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel the turner diaries he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms photocopies of pages sixtyone and sixtytwo of the turner diaries were found in an envelope inside mcveighs car these pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the us capitol in washington in a word essay dated march  from the federal maximumsecurity prison at florence colorado mcveigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was morally equivalent to us military actions against iraq and other foreign countries the handwritten essay submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine media bypass was distributed worldwide by the associated press on may   this was written in the midst of the  iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before operation desert fox the administration has said that iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons weapons of mass destruction — mainly because they have used them in the past well if thats the standard by which these matters are decided then the us is the nation that set the precedent the us has stockpiled these same weapons and more for over  years the us claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its cold war with the soviet union why then it is invalid for iraq to claim the same reason deterrence with respect to iraqs real war with and the continued threat of its neighbor iran the administration claims that iraq has used these weapons in the past weve all seen the pictures that show a kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons but have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from hiroshima or nagasaki i suggest that one study the histories of world war i world war ii and other regional conflicts that the us has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of weapons of mass destruction remember dresden how about hanoi tripoli baghdad what about the big ones — hiroshima and nagasaki at these two locations the us killed at least  noncombatants — mostly women and children — in the blink of an eye thousands more took hours days weeks or months to die if saddam is such a demon and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of mass destruction — like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above the truth is the us has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction the essay which marked the first time that mcveigh publicly discussed the oklahoma city bombing continued hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children in oklahoma city it was family convenience that explained the presence of a daycare center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building yet when discussion shifts to iraq any daycare center in a government building instantly becomes a shield think about it when considering morality and mens rea criminal intent in light of these facts i ask who are the true barbarians  i find it ironic to say the least that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on iraq is dubbed the spirit of oklahoma this leads me to a final and unspoken moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction when a us plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise what a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake unfortunately the morality of killing is not so superficial the truth is the use of a truck a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself these are weapons of mass destruction — and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons whether you wish to admit it or not when you approve morally of the bombing of foreign targets by the us military you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in oklahoma city  mcveigh included photocopies of a famous vietnam warera picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs and of nuclear devastation in japan he said in a preface that the essay was intended to provoke thought — and was not written with malevolent intent on april   mcveigh wrote a letter to fox news i explain herein why i bombed the murrah federal building in oklahoma city which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack mcveigh read unintended consequences and said that if it had come out a few years earlier he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building accomplicesedit mcveighs accomplice terry nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime at nichols trial evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved several residents of central kansas including real estate agent georgia rucker and a retired army nco testified at terry nichols federal trial that they had seen two trucks at geary lake state park where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled the retired nco said he visited the lake on april   but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively the operator of the dreamland motel testified that two ryder trucks had been parked outside her grandview plaza motel where mcveigh stayed in room  the weekend before the bombing terry nichols is incarcerated at adx florence in florence colorado an atf informant carol howe told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of elohim city oklahoma were planning a major bombing attack mcveigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time other than this speeding ticket there is no evidence of a connection between mcveigh and members of the midwest bank robbers at elohim city in february  the fbi announced it would review its investigation after learning that agents in the investigation of the midwest bank robbers an alleged aryanoriented gang had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger the oklahoma city bomb agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the midwest bank robbers investigation mcveigh declined further delays and maintained until his death that he had acted alone in the bombing some witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect and there was a search for a john doe  but none was ever found see alsoedit united states

ammonium nitrate and nitromethane fertilizer truck bomb timothy james mcveigh april   – june   was an american domestic terrorist convicted and executed for the detonation of an ammonium nitrate fertilizer and nitromethane truck bomb in front of the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city on april   commonly referred to as the oklahoma city bombing the attack killed  people and injured over  according to the united states government it was the deadliest act of terrorism within the united states prior to the september  attacks and remains the most significant act of domestic

increase more taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement they mess up we suffer taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels with no slowdown in sight  is a civil war imminent do we have to shed blood to reform the current system i hope it doesnt come to that but it might mcveigh also wrote to representative john j lafalce d new york complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace

introduced his sister to antigovernment literature but his father had little interest in these views he moved out of his fathers house and into an apartment that had no telephone which had the advantage of making it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments he also quit the nra viewing its stance on gun rights as too weak  waco siege and gun showsedit in  he drove to waco texas during the waco siege to show his support at the scene he distributed progun rights literature and bumper stickers such as when guns are outlawed i will become an outlaw he told a student reporter the government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times once you take away the guns you can do anything to the people you give them an inch and they take a mile i believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government the government is continually growing bigger and more powerful and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control for the five months following the waco siege mcveigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed up with lon horiuchis name and address in the hope that somebody in the patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter horiuchi is an fbi sniper and some of his official actions have drawn controversy specifically his shooting and killing of randy weavers wife while she held an infant child he wrote hate mail to the sniper suggesting that what goes around comes around mcveigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the murrah building to target horiuchi or a member of his family instead mcveigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows mcveigh found that the further west

attacks and considered buying property in seligman arizona which he determined to be in a nuclearfree zone mcveigh lived with michael fortier in kingman arizona and they became so close that he served as best man at fortiers wedding mcveigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia however he was never as interested in drugs as fortier was one of the reasons they parted ways was mcveighs boredom with fortiers drug habits with nichols waco siege radicalization and first explosive devicesedit in april  mcveigh headed for a farm in michigan where terry nichols lived in between watching coverage of the waco siege on tv nichols and his brother began teaching mcveigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials specifically they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs the destruction of the waco compound enraged mcveigh and convinced him that it was time to take action the governments use of cs gas on women and children angered mcveigh he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects the disappearance of certain evidence such as the bulletriddled steelreinforced front door to the complex led him to suspect a coverup mcveighs antigovernment rhetoric became more radical he began to sell bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf hats riddled with bullet holes and a flare gun which he said could shoot down an atf helicopter he produced videos detailing the governments actions at waco and handed out pamphlets with titles like us government initiates open warfare against american people and waco shootout evokes memory of warsaw  he began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by patrick henry such as give me liberty or give me death he began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices the government also imposed new firearms restrictions in  that mcveigh believed threatened his livelihood mcveigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend steve hodge by sending him a page farewell letter he proclaimed his devotion to the united states declaration of independence explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him mcveigh declared that those who betray or subvert the constitution are guilty of sedition andor treason are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly it also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty i have sworn to uphold and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and i will and i will because not only did i swear to but i believe in what it stands for in every bit of my heart soul and being i know in my heart that i am right in my struggle steve i have come to peace with myself my god and my cause blood will flow in the streets steve good vs evil free men vs socialist wannabe slaves pray it is not your blood my friend mcveigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies he visited area  in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to gulfport mississippi to determine the veracity of rumors about united nations operations these turned out to be false the russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in unsponsored humanitarian aid efforts around this time mcveigh and nichols also began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer for resale to survivalists since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it plan against federal building or individualsedit mcveigh told fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building but fortier declined to participate fortier also told his wife about the plans mcveigh composed two letters to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the first titled constitutional defenders and the second atf read he denounced government officials as fascist tyrants and storm troopers and warned atf all you tyrannical people will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the constitution of the united states remember the nuremberg war trials mcveigh also wrote a letter of recruitment to a customer named steve colbern a man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energyanger can be focused toward a commonrighteous goal what im asking you to do then is sit back and be honest with yourself do you have kidswife would you back out at the last minute to care for the family are you interested in keeping your firearms for their currentfuture monetary value or would you drag that  through rock swamp and cactus to get off the needed shot in short im not looking for talkers im looking for fighters and if you are a fed think twice think twice about the constitution you are supposedly enforcing isnt enforcing freedom an oxymoron and think twice about catching us with our guard down – you will lose just like degan did – and your family will lose mcveigh began announcing that he had progressed from the propaganda phase to the action phase he wrote to his michigan friend gwenda strider i have certain other militant talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded mcveigh later said he considered a campaign of individual assassination with eligible targets including attorneygeneral janet reno judge walter s smith jr of federal district court who handled the branch davidian trial and lon horiuchi a member of the fbi hostagerescue team who shot and killed vicki weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at ruby ridge idaho in  he said he wanted reno to accept full responsibility in deed not just words such an assassination seemed too difficult and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers according to mcveighs authorized biography he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building after the bombing he was ambivalent about his act as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead oklahoma city bombingedit main article oklahoma city bombing the alfred p murrah federal building two days after the oklahoma city bombing working at a lakeside campground near mcveighs old army post he and nichols constructed an annm explosive device mounted in the back of a rented ryder truck the bomb consisted of about  pounds  kg of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane on april   mcveigh drove the truck to the front of the alfred p murrah federal building just as its offices opened for the day before arriving he stopped to light a twominute fuse at  a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building it killed  people including nineteen children in the day care center on the second floor and injured  others mcveigh said that he had no knowledge that the federal offices also ran a daycare center on the second floor of the building and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it nichols disputed this saying that he and mcveigh knew there was a daycare center in the building and that they did not care mcveighs biographers lou michel and dan herbeck quote mcveigh with whom they spoke for  hours on his attitude to the victims to these people in oklahoma who have lost a loved one im sorry but it happens every day youre not the first mother to lose a kid or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter it happens every day somewhere in the world im not going to go into that courtroom curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that during an interview with ed bradley for television news magazine  minutes in  bradley asked mcveigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children mcveigh stated i thought it was terrible that there were children in the building according to the oklahoma city memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism mipt more than  buildings were damaged more than  volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue recovery and support operations following the bombing in reference to theories that he had assistance from others mcveigh quoted a well known line from the film a few good men you cant handle the truth and added because the truth is i blew up the murrah building and isnt it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell arrest trial conviction and sentencingedit fbi forensic sketch of mcveigh and his fbi mugshot by tracing the vehicle identification number vin of a rear axle found in the wreckage the fbi identified the vehicle as a ryder rental box truck rented from junction city kansas workers at the agency assisted an fbi artist in creating a sketch of the renter who had used the alias robert kling the sketch was shown in the area lea mcgown manager of the local dreamland motel identified the sketch as timothy mcveigh shortly after the bombing while driving on i in noble county near perry oklahoma mcveigh was stopped by oklahoma state trooper charles j hanger hanger had passed mcveighs yellow  mercury marquis and noticed that it had no license plate mcveigh admitted to the police officer who noticed a bulge under his jacket that he had a gun and mcveigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession mcveighs concealed weapon permit was not legal in oklahoma mcveigh was wearing a tshirt at that time with a picture of abraham lincoln and the motto sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants the supposed words shouted by john wilkes booth after he shot lincoln on the back it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the thomas jefferson quote the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants three days later while still in jail mcveigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt mcveigh about to be led out of a perry oklahoma courthouse two days after the oklahoma city bombing on august   mcveigh was indicted on eleven federal counts including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction use of a weapon of mass destruction destruction with the use of explosives and eight counts of firstdegree murder on february   the court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from oklahoma city to the us district court in denver colorado to be presided over by us district judge richard paul matsch mcveigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense but they ended up not doing so because they would have had to prove that mcveigh was in imminent danger from the government mcveigh himself argued that imminent did not necessarily mean immediate they would have argued that his bombing of the murrah building was a justifiable response to what mcveigh believed were the crimes of the us government at waco texas where the day siege of the branch davidian complex resulted in the deaths of  branch davidians as part of the defense mcveighs lawyers showed the jury the controversial video waco the big lie on june   mcveigh was found guilty on all eleven counts of the federal indictment after the verdict mcveigh tried to calm his mother by saying think of it this way when i was in the army you didnt see me for years think of me that way now like im away in the army again on an assignment for the military on june   the jury recommended that mcveigh receive the death penalty the us department of justice brought federal charges against mcveigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for mcveigh they could not bring charges against mcveigh for the remaining  murders in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the state of oklahoma because mcveigh was convicted and sentenced to death the state of oklahoma did not file murder charges against mcveigh for the other  deaths before the sentence was formally pronounced by judge matsch mcveigh addressed the court for the first time and said if the court please i wish to use the words of justice brandeis dissenting in olmstead to speak for me he wrote our government is the potent the omnipresent teacher for good or for ill it teaches the whole people by its example thats all i have incarceration and executionedit florence admax usp where mcveigh was incarcerated while imprisoned mcveigh had the federal bureau of prisons bop register number  mcveighs death sentence was delayed pending an appeal one of his appeals for certiorari taken to the supreme court of the united states was denied on march   mcveighs request for a nationally televised execution was also denied an internet company also unsuccessfully sued for the right to broadcast it at adx florence mcveigh and nichols were housed in bombers row the same cell block as ted kaczynski luis felipe and ramzi yousef yousef made frequent unsuccessful attempts to convert mcveigh to islam mcveigh said i am sorry these people had to lose their lives but thats the nature of the beast its understood going in what the human toll will be he said that if there turned out to be an afterlife he would improvise adapt and overcome noting if there is a hell then ill be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war he also said i knew i wanted this before it happened i knew my objective was stateassisted suicide and when it happens its in your face you just did something youre trying to say should be illegal for medical personnel united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana the site of the federal death row for men and the federal execution chamber death certificate of timothy mcveigh the bop transferred mcveigh from adx florence to the federal death row at united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana in  mcveigh dropped his remaining appeals saying that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison on january   the federal bureau of prisons set may   as mcveighs execution date mcveigh stated that his only regret was not completely leveling the federal building six days prior to his scheduled execution the fbi turned over thousands of documents of evidence it had previously withheld to mcveighs attorneys as a result us attorney general john ashcroft announced mcveighs execution would be stayed for one month the execution date was reset for june   mcveigh invited california conductorcomposer david woodard to perform prerequiem mass music on the eve of his execution he requested a catholic chaplain he requested two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream for his last meal mcveigh chose william ernest henleys poem invictus as his final statement just before the execution when he was asked if he had a final statement he declined jay sawyer a relative of one of the victims wrote without saying a word he got the final word larry whicher whose brother died in the attack described mcveigh as having a totally expressionless blank stare he had a look of defiance and that if he could hed do it all over again mcveigh was executed by lethal injection at  am on june   at the us federal penitentiary in terre haute indiana the first federal prisoner to be executed by the united states federal government since victor feguer was executed in iowa on march   on november   president bill clinton had signed s  special legislation introduced by senator arlen specter to bar mcveigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery his body was cremated at mattox ryan funeral home in terre haute his ashes were given to his lawyer who said that the final destination of mcveighs remains would remain privileged forever mcveigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood but decided that would be too vengeful too raw too cold he had expressed willingness to donate organs but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations psychiatrist john smith concluded that mcveigh was a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible violent act mcveighs iq was assessed at  associationsedit according to cnn his only known associations were as a registered republican while in buffalo new york in the s and a membership in the national rifle association while in the army and there is no evidence that he ever belonged to any extremist groups religious beliefsedit mcveigh was raised roman catholic during his childhood he and his father attended mass regularly mcveigh was confirmed at the good shepherd church in pendleton new york in  in a  interview mcveigh professed belief in a god although he said he had sort of lost touch with catholicism and i never really picked it up however i do maintain core beliefs in mcveighs biography american terrorist released in  he stated that he did not believe in a hell and that science is his religion in june  a day before the execution mcveigh wrote a letter to the buffalo news identifying himself as agnostic however he took the last rites administered by a priest just before his execution father charles smith ministered to mcveigh in his last moments in death row motivations for the bombingedit why mcveigh told us at eloquent length but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic crazed monster  who had done it for the kicks —gore vidal  mcveigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at waco texas and ruby ridge mcveigh visited waco during the standoff while there he was interviewed by student reporter michelle rauch a senior journalism major at southern methodist university who was writing for the school paper mcveigh expressed his objections over what was happening there  mcveigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel the turner diaries he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms photocopies of pages sixtyone and sixtytwo of the turner diaries were found in an envelope inside mcveighs car these pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the us capitol in washington in a word essay dated march  from the federal maximumsecurity prison at florence colorado mcveigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was morally equivalent to us military actions against iraq and other foreign countries the handwritten essay submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine media bypass was distributed worldwide by the associated press on may   this was written in the midst of the  iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before operation desert fox the administration has said that iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons weapons of mass destruction — mainly because they have used them in the past well if thats the standard by which these matters are decided then the us is the nation that set the precedent the us has stockpiled these same weapons and more for over  years the us claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its cold war with the soviet union why then it is invalid for iraq to claim the same reason deterrence with respect to iraqs real war with and the continued threat of its neighbor iran the administration claims that iraq has used these weapons in the past weve all seen the pictures that show a kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons but have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from hiroshima or nagasaki i suggest that one study the histories of world war i world war ii and other regional conflicts that the us has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of weapons of mass destruction remember dresden how about hanoi tripoli baghdad what about the big ones — hiroshima and nagasaki at these two locations the us killed at least  noncombatants — mostly women and children — in the blink of an eye thousands more took hours days weeks or months to die if saddam is such a demon and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of mass destruction — like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above the truth is the us has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction the essay which marked the first time that mcveigh publicly discussed the oklahoma city bombing continued hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children in oklahoma city it was family convenience that explained the presence of a daycare center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building yet when discussion shifts to iraq any daycare center in a government building instantly becomes a shield think about it when considering morality and mens rea criminal intent in light of these facts i ask who are the true barbarians  i find it ironic to say the least that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on iraq is dubbed the spirit of oklahoma this leads me to a final and unspoken moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction when a us plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise what a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake unfortunately the morality of killing is not so superficial the truth is the use of a truck a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself these are weapons of mass destruction — and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons whether you wish to admit it or not when you approve morally of the bombing of foreign targets by the us military you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in oklahoma city  mcveigh included photocopies of a famous vietnam warera picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs and of nuclear devastation in japan he said in a preface that the essay was intended to provoke thought — and was not written with malevolent intent on april   mcveigh wrote a letter to fox news i explain herein why i bombed the murrah federal building in oklahoma city which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack mcveigh read unintended consequences and said that if it had come out a few years earlier he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building accomplicesedit mcveighs accomplice terry nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime at nichols trial evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved several residents of central kansas including real estate agent georgia rucker and a retired army nco testified at terry nichols federal trial that they had seen two trucks at geary lake state park where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled the retired nco said he visited the lake on april   but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively the operator of the dreamland motel testified that two ryder trucks had been parked outside her grandview plaza motel where mcveigh stayed in room  the weekend before the bombing terry nichols is incarcerated at adx florence in florence colorado an atf informant carol howe told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of elohim city oklahoma were planning a major bombing attack mcveigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time other than this speeding ticket there is no evidence of a connection between mcveigh and members of the midwest bank robbers at elohim city in february  the fbi announced it would review its investigation after learning that agents in the investigation of the midwest bank robbers an alleged aryanoriented gang had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger the oklahoma city bomb agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the midwest bank robbers investigation mcveigh declined further delays and maintained until his death that he had acted alone in the bombing some witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect and there was a search for a john doe  but none was ever found see alsoedit united states

increase more taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement they mess up we suffer taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels with no slowdown in sight  is a civil war imminent do we have to shed blood to reform the current system i hope it doesnt come to that but it might mcveigh also wrote to representative john j lafalce d new york complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace it is a lie if we tell ourselves that the police can protect us everywhere at all times firearms restrictions are bad enough but now a woman cant even carry mace in her purse while visiting friends in

to waco texas during the waco siege to show his support at the scene he distributed progun rights literature and bumper stickers such as when guns are outlawed i will become an outlaw he told a student reporter the government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times once you take away the guns you can do anything to the people you give them an inch and they take a mile i believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government the government is continually growing bigger and more powerful and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control for the five months following the waco siege mcveigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed up with lon horiuchis name and address in the hope that somebody in the patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter horiuchi is an fbi sniper and some of his official actions have drawn controversy specifically his shooting and killing of randy weavers wife while she held an infant child he wrote hate mail to the sniper suggesting that what goes around comes around mcveigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the murrah building to target horiuchi or a member of his family instead mcveigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows mcveigh found that the further west

attacks and considered buying property in seligman arizona which he determined to be in a nuclearfree zone mcveigh lived with michael fortier in kingman arizona and they became so close that he served as best man at fortiers wedding mcveigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia however he was never as interested in drugs as fortier

michigan where terry nichols lived in between watching coverage of the waco siege on tv nichols and his brother began teaching mcveigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials specifically they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs the destruction of the waco compound enraged mcveigh and convinced him that it was time to take action the governments use of cs gas on women and children angered mcveigh he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects the disappearance of certain evidence such as the bulletriddled steelreinforced front door to the complex led him to suspect a coverup mcveighs antigovernment rhetoric became more radical he began to sell bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf hats riddled with bullet holes and a flare gun which he said could shoot down an atf helicopter he produced videos detailing the governments actions at waco and handed out pamphlets with titles like us government initiates open warfare against american people and waco shootout evokes memory of warsaw  he began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by patrick henry such as give me liberty or give me death he began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices the government also imposed new firearms restrictions in  that mcveigh believed

independence explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him mcveigh declared that those who betray or subvert the constitution are guilty of sedition andor treason are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly it also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty i have sworn to uphold and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and i will and i will because not only did i swear to but i believe in what it stands for in every bit of my heart soul and being i know in my heart that i am right in my struggle steve i have come to peace with myself my god and my cause blood will flow in the streets steve good vs evil free men vs socialist wannabe slaves pray it is not your blood my friend mcveigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies he visited area  in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to gulfport mississippi to determine the veracity of rumors about united nations operations these turned out to be false the russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in unsponsored humanitarian aid efforts around this time mcveigh and nichols also began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer for resale to survivalists since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it plan against federal building or individualsedit mcveigh told fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building but fortier declined to participate fortier also told his wife about the plans mcveigh composed two letters to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the first titled constitutional defenders and the second atf read he denounced government officials as fascist tyrants and storm troopers and warned atf all you tyrannical people will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the constitution of the united states remember the nuremberg war trials mcveigh also wrote a letter of recruitment to a customer named steve colbern a man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energyanger can be focused toward a commonrighteous goal what im asking you to do then is sit back and be honest with yourself do you have kidswife would you back out at the last minute to care for the family are you interested in keeping your firearms for their currentfuture monetary value or would you drag that  through rock swamp and cactus to get off the needed shot in short im not looking for talkers im looking for fighters and if you are a fed think twice think twice about the constitution you are supposedly enforcing isnt enforcing freedom an oxymoron and think twice about catching us with our guard down – you will lose just like degan did – and your family will lose mcveigh began announcing that he had progressed from the propaganda phase to the action phase he wrote to his michigan friend gwenda strider i have certain other militant talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded mcveigh later said he considered a campaign of individual assassination with eligible targets including attorneygeneral janet reno judge walter s smith jr of federal district court who handled the branch davidian trial and lon horiuchi a member of the fbi hostagerescue team who shot and killed vicki weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at ruby ridge idaho in  he said he wanted reno to accept full responsibility in deed not just words such an assassination seemed too difficult and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers according to mcveighs authorized biography he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building after the bombing he was ambivalent about his act as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead oklahoma city bombingedit main article oklahoma city bombing the alfred p murrah federal building two days after the oklahoma city bombing working at a lakeside campground near mcveighs old army post he and nichols constructed an annm explosive device mounted in the back of a rented ryder truck the bomb consisted of about  pounds  kg of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane on april   mcveigh drove the truck to the front of the alfred p murrah federal building just as its offices opened for the day before arriving he stopped to light a twominute fuse at  a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building it killed  people including nineteen children in the day care center on the second floor and injured  others mcveigh said that he had no knowledge that the federal offices also ran a daycare center on the second floor of the building and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it nichols disputed this saying that he and mcveigh knew there was a daycare center in the building and that they did not care mcveighs biographers lou michel and dan herbeck quote mcveigh with whom they spoke for  hours on his attitude to the victims to these people in oklahoma who have lost a loved one im sorry but it happens every day youre not the first mother to lose a kid or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter it happens every day somewhere in the world im not going to go into that courtroom curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that during an interview with ed bradley for television news magazine  minutes in  bradley asked mcveigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children mcveigh stated i thought it was terrible that there were children in the building according to the oklahoma city memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism mipt more than  buildings were damaged more than  volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue recovery and support operations following the bombing in reference to theories that he had assistance from others mcveigh quoted a well known line from the film a few good men you cant handle the truth and added because the truth is i blew up the murrah building and isnt it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell arrest trial conviction and sentencingedit fbi forensic sketch of mcveigh and his fbi mugshot by tracing the vehicle identification number vin of a rear axle found in the wreckage the fbi identified the vehicle as a ryder rental box truck rented from junction city kansas workers at the agency assisted an fbi artist in creating a sketch of the renter who had used the alias robert kling the sketch was shown in the area lea mcgown manager of the local dreamland motel identified the sketch as timothy mcveigh shortly after the bombing while driving on i in noble county near perry oklahoma mcveigh was stopped by oklahoma state trooper charles j hanger hanger had passed mcveighs yellow  mercury marquis and noticed that it had no license plate mcveigh admitted to the police officer who noticed a bulge under his jacket that he had a gun and mcveigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession mcveighs concealed weapon permit was not legal in oklahoma mcveigh was wearing a tshirt at that time with a picture of abraham lincoln and the motto sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants the supposed words shouted by john wilkes booth after he shot lincoln on the back it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the thomas jefferson quote the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants three days later while still in jail mcveigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt mcveigh about to be led out of a perry oklahoma courthouse two days after the oklahoma city bombing on august   mcveigh was indicted on eleven federal counts including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction use of a weapon of mass destruction destruction with the use of explosives and eight counts of firstdegree murder on february   the court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from oklahoma city to the us district court in denver colorado to be presided over by us district judge richard paul matsch mcveigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense but they ended up not doing so because they would have had to prove that mcveigh was in imminent danger from the government mcveigh himself argued that imminent did not necessarily mean immediate they would have argued that his bombing of the murrah building was a justifiable response to what mcveigh believed were the crimes of the us government at waco texas where the day siege of the branch davidian complex resulted in the deaths of  branch davidians as part of the defense mcveighs lawyers showed the jury the controversial video waco the big lie on june   mcveigh was found guilty on all eleven counts of the federal indictment after the verdict mcveigh tried to calm his mother by saying think of it this way when i was in the army you didnt see me for years think of me that way now like im away in the army again on an assignment for the military on june   the jury recommended that mcveigh receive the death penalty the us department of justice brought federal charges against mcveigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for mcveigh they could not bring charges against mcveigh for the remaining  murders in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the state of oklahoma because mcveigh was convicted and sentenced to death the state of oklahoma did not file murder charges against mcveigh for the other  deaths before the sentence was formally pronounced by judge matsch mcveigh addressed the court for the first time and said if the court please i wish to use the words of justice brandeis dissenting in olmstead to speak for me he wrote our government is the potent the omnipresent teacher for good or for ill it teaches the whole people by its example thats all i have incarceration and executionedit florence admax usp where mcveigh was incarcerated while imprisoned mcveigh had the federal bureau of prisons bop register number  mcveighs death sentence was delayed pending an appeal one of his appeals for certiorari taken to the supreme court of the united states was denied on march   mcveighs request for a

block as ted kaczynski luis felipe and ramzi yousef yousef made frequent unsuccessful attempts to convert mcveigh to islam mcveigh said i am sorry these people had to lose their lives but thats the

california conductorcomposer david woodard to perform prerequiem mass music on the eve of his execution he requested a catholic chaplain he requested two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream for his last meal mcveigh chose william ernest henleys poem invictus as his final statement just before the execution when he was asked if he had a final statement he declined jay sawyer a relative of one of the victims wrote without saying a word he got the final word larry whicher whose brother died in the attack described mcveigh as having a totally expressionless blank stare he had a look of defiance and that if he could hed do it all over again mcveigh was executed by lethal injection at  am on june   at the us federal penitentiary in terre haute indiana the first federal prisoner to be executed by the united states federal government since victor feguer was executed in iowa on march   on november   president bill clinton had signed s  special legislation introduced by senator arlen specter

lawyer who said that the final destination of mcveighs remains would remain privileged forever mcveigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood but decided that would be too vengeful too raw too cold he had expressed willingness to donate organs but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations psychiatrist john smith concluded that mcveigh was a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible violent act mcveighs iq was assessed at  associationsedit according to cnn his only known associations were as a registered republican while in buffalo new york in the s and a membership in the national rifle association while in the army and there is no

mcveigh wrote a letter to the buffalo news identifying himself as agnostic however he took the last rites administered by a priest just before his execution father charles smith ministered to mcveigh in his last moments in death row motivations for the bombingedit why mcveigh told us at eloquent length but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic crazed monster  who had done it for the kicks —gore vidal  mcveigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at waco texas and ruby ridge mcveigh visited waco during the standoff while there he was interviewed by student reporter michelle rauch a senior journalism major at southern methodist university who was writing for the school paper mcveigh expressed his objections over what was happening there  mcveigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel the turner diaries he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms photocopies of pages sixtyone and sixtytwo of the turner diaries were found in an envelope inside mcveighs car these pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the us capitol in washington in a word essay dated march  from the federal maximumsecurity prison at florence colorado mcveigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was morally equivalent to us military actions against iraq and other foreign countries the handwritten essay submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine media bypass was distributed worldwide by the associated press on may   this was written in the midst of the  iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before operation desert fox the administration has said that iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons weapons of mass destruction — mainly because they have used them in the past well if thats the standard by which these matters are decided then the us is the nation that set the precedent the us has stockpiled these same weapons and more for over  years the us claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its cold war with the soviet union why then it is invalid for iraq to claim the same reason deterrence with respect to iraqs real war with and the continued threat of its neighbor iran the administration claims that iraq has used these weapons in the past weve all seen the pictures that show a kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons but have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from hiroshima or nagasaki i suggest that one study the histories of world war i world war ii and other regional conflicts that the us has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of weapons of mass destruction remember dresden how about hanoi tripoli baghdad what about the big ones — hiroshima and nagasaki at these two locations the us killed at least  noncombatants — mostly women and children — in the blink of an eye thousands more took hours days weeks or months to die if saddam is such a demon and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of mass destruction — like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above the truth is the us has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction the essay which marked the first time that mcveigh publicly discussed the oklahoma city bombing continued hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children in oklahoma city it was family convenience that explained the presence of a daycare center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building yet when discussion shifts to iraq any daycare center in a government building instantly becomes a shield think about it when considering morality and mens rea criminal intent in light of these facts i ask who are the true barbarians  i find it ironic to say the least that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on iraq is dubbed the spirit of oklahoma this leads me to a final and unspoken moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction when a us plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise what a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake unfortunately the morality of killing is not so superficial the truth is the use of a truck a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself these are weapons of mass destruction — and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons whether you wish to admit it or not when you approve morally of the bombing of foreign targets by the us military you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in oklahoma city  mcveigh included photocopies of a famous vietnam warera picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs and of nuclear devastation in japan he said in a preface that the essay was intended to provoke thought — and was not written with malevolent intent on april   mcveigh wrote a letter to fox news i explain herein why i bombed the murrah federal building in oklahoma city which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack mcveigh read unintended consequences and said that if it had come out a few years earlier he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building accomplicesedit mcveighs accomplice terry nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime at nichols trial evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved several residents of central kansas including real estate agent georgia rucker and a retired army nco testified at terry nichols federal trial that they had seen two trucks at geary lake state park where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled the retired nco said he visited the lake on april   but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively the operator of the dreamland motel testified that two ryder trucks had been parked outside her grandview plaza motel where mcveigh stayed in room  the weekend before the bombing terry nichols is incarcerated at adx florence in florence colorado an atf informant carol howe told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of elohim city oklahoma were planning a major bombing attack mcveigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time other than this speeding ticket there is no evidence of a connection between mcveigh and members of the midwest bank robbers at elohim city in february  the fbi announced it would review its investigation after learning that agents in the investigation of the midwest bank robbers an alleged aryanoriented gang had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger the oklahoma city bomb agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the midwest bank robbers investigation mcveigh declined further delays and maintained until his death that he had acted alone in the bombing some witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect and there was a search for a john doe  but none was ever found see alsoedit united states

increase more taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement they mess up we suffer taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels with no slowdown in sight  is a civil war imminent do we have to shed blood to reform the current system i hope it doesnt come to that but it might mcveigh also wrote to representative john j lafalce d new york complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying mace

began looking for a state without heavy government regulation or high taxes he became enraged when the government told him that he had been overpaid  while in the army and he had to pay back the money he wrote an angry letter to the government inviting them to go ahead take everything i own take my dignity feel good as you grow fat and rich at my expense sucking my tax dollars and property mcveigh introduced his sister to antigovernment literature but his father had little interest in these views he moved out of his fathers house and into an apartment that had no telephone which had the advantage of making it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments he also quit the nra viewing its stance on gun rights as too weak  waco siege and gun showsedit in  he drove to waco texas during the waco siege to show his support at the scene he distributed progun rights literature and bumper stickers such as when guns are outlawed i will become an outlaw he told a student reporter the government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times once you take away the guns you can do anything to the people you give them an inch and they take a mile i believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government the government is continually growing bigger and more powerful and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control for the five months following the waco siege mcveigh worked at gun shows and handed out free cards printed up with lon horiuchis name and address in the hope that somebody in the patriot movement would assassinate the sharpshooter horiuchi is an fbi sniper and some of his official actions have drawn controversy specifically his shooting and killing of randy weavers wife while she held an infant child he wrote hate mail to the sniper suggesting that what goes around comes around mcveigh later considered putting aside his plan to target the murrah building to target horiuchi or a member of his family instead mcveigh became a fixture on the gun show circuit traveling to forty states and visiting about eighty gun shows mcveigh found that the further west he went the more antigovernment sentiment he encountered at least until he got to what he called the peoples socialist republic of california mcveigh sold survival items and copies of the turner diaries one author said in the gun show culture mcveigh found a home though he remained skeptical of some of the most extreme ideas being bandied around he liked talking to people there about the

attacks and considered buying property in seligman arizona which he determined to be in a nuclearfree zone mcveigh lived with michael fortier in kingman arizona and they became so close that he served as best man at fortiers wedding mcveigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia however he was never as interested in drugs as fortier was one of the reasons they parted ways was mcveighs boredom with fortiers drug habits with nichols waco siege radicalization and first explosive devicesedit in april  mcveigh headed for a farm in michigan where terry nichols lived in between watching coverage of the waco siege on tv nichols and his brother began teaching mcveigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials specifically they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs the destruction of the waco compound enraged mcveigh and convinced him that it was time to take action the governments use of cs gas on women and children angered mcveigh he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects the disappearance of certain evidence such as the bulletriddled steelreinforced front door to the complex led him to suspect a coverup mcveighs antigovernment rhetoric became more radical he began to sell bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf hats riddled with bullet holes and a flare gun which he said could shoot down an atf helicopter he produced videos detailing the governments actions at waco and handed out pamphlets with titles like us government initiates open warfare against american people and waco shootout evokes memory of warsaw  he began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by patrick henry such as give me liberty or give me death he began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices the government also imposed new firearms restrictions in  that mcveigh believed threatened his livelihood mcveigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend steve hodge by sending him a page farewell letter he proclaimed his devotion to the united states declaration of independence explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him mcveigh declared that those who betray or subvert the constitution are guilty of sedition andor treason are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly it also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty i have sworn to uphold and defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and i will and i will because not only did i swear to but i believe in what it stands for in every bit of my heart soul and being i know in my heart that i am right in my struggle steve i have come to peace with myself my god and my cause blood will flow in the streets steve good vs evil free men vs socialist wannabe slaves pray it is not your blood my friend mcveigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies he visited area  in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to gulfport mississippi to determine the veracity of rumors about united nations operations these turned out to be false the russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in unsponsored humanitarian aid efforts around this time mcveigh and nichols also began making bulk purchases of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer for resale to survivalists since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it plan against federal building or individualsedit mcveigh told fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building but fortier declined to participate fortier also told his wife about the plans mcveigh composed two letters to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the first titled constitutional defenders and the second atf read he denounced government officials as fascist tyrants and storm troopers and warned atf all you tyrannical people will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the constitution of the united states remember the nuremberg war trials mcveigh also wrote a letter of recruitment to a customer named steve colbern a man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energyanger can be focused toward a commonrighteous goal what im asking you to do then is sit back and be honest with yourself do you have kidswife would you back out at the last minute to care for the family are you interested in keeping your firearms for their currentfuture monetary value or would you drag that  through rock swamp and cactus to get off the needed shot in short im not looking for talkers im looking for fighters and if you are a fed think twice think twice about the constitution you are supposedly enforcing isnt enforcing freedom an oxymoron and think twice about catching us with our guard down – you will lose just like degan did – and your family will lose mcveigh began announcing that he had progressed from the propaganda phase to the action phase he wrote to his michigan friend gwenda strider i have certain other militant talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded mcveigh later said he considered a campaign of individual assassination with eligible targets including attorneygeneral janet reno judge walter s smith jr of federal district court who handled the branch davidian trial and lon horiuchi a member of the fbi hostagerescue team who shot and killed vicki weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at ruby ridge idaho in  he said he wanted reno to accept full responsibility in deed not just words such an assassination seemed too difficult and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers according to mcveighs authorized biography he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building after the bombing he was ambivalent about his act as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead oklahoma city bombingedit main article oklahoma city bombing the alfred p murrah federal building two days after the oklahoma city bombing working at a lakeside campground near mcveighs old army post he and nichols constructed an annm explosive device mounted in the back of a rented ryder truck the bomb consisted of about  pounds  kg of ammonium nitrate and nitromethane on april   mcveigh drove the truck to the front of the alfred p murrah federal building just as its offices opened for the day before arriving he stopped to light a twominute fuse at  a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building it killed  people including nineteen children in the day care center on the second floor and injured  others mcveigh said that he had no knowledge that the federal offices also ran a daycare center on the second floor of the building and that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about it nichols disputed this saying that he and mcveigh knew there was a daycare center in the building and that they did not care mcveighs biographers lou michel and dan herbeck quote mcveigh with whom they spoke for  hours on his attitude to the victims to these people in oklahoma who have lost a loved one im sorry but it happens every day youre not the first mother to lose a kid or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter it happens every day somewhere in the world im not going to go into that courtroom curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that during an interview with ed bradley for television news magazine  minutes in  bradley asked mcveigh for his reaction to the deaths of the nineteen children mcveigh stated i thought it was terrible that there were children in the building according to the oklahoma city memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism mipt more than  buildings were damaged more than  volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue recovery and support operations following the bombing in reference to theories that he had assistance from others mcveigh quoted a well known line from the film a few good men you cant handle the truth and added because the truth is i blew up the murrah building and isnt it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell arrest trial conviction and sentencingedit fbi forensic sketch of mcveigh and his fbi mugshot by tracing the vehicle identification number vin of a rear axle found in the wreckage the fbi identified the vehicle as a ryder rental box truck rented from junction city kansas workers at the agency assisted an fbi artist in creating a sketch of the renter who had used the alias robert kling the sketch was shown in the area lea mcgown manager of the local dreamland motel identified the sketch as timothy mcveigh shortly after the bombing while driving on i in noble county near perry oklahoma mcveigh was stopped by oklahoma state trooper charles j hanger hanger had passed mcveighs yellow  mercury marquis and noticed that it had no license plate mcveigh admitted to the police officer who noticed a bulge under his jacket that he had a gun and mcveigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession mcveighs concealed weapon permit was not legal in oklahoma mcveigh was wearing a tshirt at that time with a picture of abraham lincoln and the motto sic semper tyrannis thus always to tyrants the supposed words shouted by john wilkes booth after he shot lincoln on the back it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the thomas jefferson quote the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants three days later while still in jail mcveigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt mcveigh about to be led out of a perry oklahoma courthouse two days after the oklahoma city bombing on august   mcveigh was indicted on eleven federal counts including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction use of a weapon of mass destruction destruction with the use of explosives and eight counts of firstdegree murder on february   the court granted a change of venue and ordered that the case be transferred from oklahoma city to the us district court in denver colorado to be presided over by us district judge richard paul matsch mcveigh instructed his lawyers to use a necessity defense but they ended up not doing so because they would have had to prove that mcveigh was in imminent danger from the government mcveigh himself argued that imminent did not necessarily mean immediate they would have argued that his bombing of the murrah building was a justifiable response to what mcveigh believed were the crimes of the us government at waco texas where the day siege of the branch davidian complex resulted in the deaths of  branch davidians as part of the defense mcveighs lawyers showed the jury the controversial video waco the big lie on june   mcveigh was found guilty on all eleven counts of the federal indictment after the verdict mcveigh tried to calm his mother by saying think of it this way when i was in the army you didnt see me for years think of me that way now like im away in the army again on an assignment for the military on june   the jury recommended that mcveigh receive the death penalty the us department of justice brought federal charges against mcveigh for causing the deaths of eight federal officers leading to a possible death penalty for mcveigh they could not bring charges against mcveigh for the remaining  murders in federal court because those deaths fell under the jurisdiction of the state of oklahoma because mcveigh was convicted and sentenced to death the state of oklahoma did not file murder charges against mcveigh for the other  deaths before the sentence was formally pronounced by judge matsch mcveigh addressed the court for the first time and said if the court please i wish to use the words of justice brandeis dissenting in olmstead to speak for me he wrote our government is the potent the omnipresent teacher for good or for ill it teaches the whole people by its example thats all i have incarceration and executionedit florence admax usp where mcveigh was incarcerated while imprisoned mcveigh had the federal bureau of prisons bop register number  mcveighs death sentence was delayed pending an appeal one of his appeals for certiorari taken to the supreme court of the united states was denied on march   mcveighs request for a nationally televised execution was also denied an internet company also unsuccessfully sued for the right to broadcast it at adx florence mcveigh and nichols were housed in bombers row the same cell block as ted kaczynski luis felipe and ramzi yousef yousef made frequent unsuccessful attempts to convert mcveigh to islam mcveigh said i am sorry these people had to lose their lives but thats the nature of the beast its understood going in what the human toll will be he said that if there turned out to be an afterlife he would improvise adapt and overcome noting if there is a hell then ill be in good company with a lot of fighter pilots who also had to bomb innocents to win the war he also said i knew i wanted this before it happened i knew my objective was stateassisted suicide and when it happens its in your face you just did something youre trying to say should be illegal for medical personnel united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana the site of the federal death row for men and the federal execution chamber death certificate of timothy mcveigh the bop transferred mcveigh from adx florence to the federal death row at united states penitentiary in terre haute indiana in  mcveigh dropped his remaining appeals saying that he would rather die than spend the rest of his life in prison on january   the federal bureau of prisons set may   as mcveighs execution date mcveigh stated that his only regret was not completely leveling the federal building six days prior to his scheduled execution the fbi turned over thousands of documents of evidence it had previously withheld to mcveighs attorneys as a result us attorney general john ashcroft announced mcveighs execution would be stayed for one month the execution date was reset for june   mcveigh invited california conductorcomposer david woodard to perform prerequiem mass music on the eve of his execution he requested a catholic chaplain he requested two pints of mint chocolate chip ice cream for his last meal mcveigh chose william ernest henleys poem invictus as his final statement just before the execution when he was asked if he had a final statement he declined jay sawyer a relative of one of the victims wrote without saying a word he got the final word larry whicher whose brother died in the attack described mcveigh as having a totally expressionless blank stare he had a look of defiance and that if he could hed do it all over again mcveigh was executed by lethal injection at  am on june   at the us federal penitentiary in terre haute indiana the first federal prisoner to be executed by the united states federal government since victor feguer was executed in iowa on march   on november   president bill clinton had signed s  special legislation introduced by senator arlen specter to bar mcveigh and other veterans convicted of capital crimes from being buried in any military cemetery his body was cremated at mattox ryan funeral home in terre haute his ashes were given to his lawyer who said that the final destination of mcveighs remains would remain privileged forever mcveigh had written that he considered having them dropped at the site of the memorial where the building once stood but decided that would be too vengeful too raw too cold he had expressed willingness to donate organs but was prohibited from doing so by prison regulations psychiatrist john smith concluded that mcveigh was a decent person who had allowed rage to build up inside him to the point that he had lashed out in one terrible violent act mcveighs iq was assessed at  associationsedit according to cnn his only known associations were as a registered republican while in buffalo new york in the s and a membership in the national rifle association while in the army and there is no evidence that he ever belonged to any extremist groups religious beliefsedit mcveigh was raised roman catholic during his childhood he and his father attended mass regularly mcveigh was confirmed at the good shepherd church in pendleton new york in  in a  interview mcveigh professed belief in a god although he said he had sort of lost touch with catholicism and i never really picked it up however i do maintain core beliefs in mcveighs biography american terrorist released in  he stated that he did not believe in a hell and that science is his religion in june  a day before the execution mcveigh wrote a letter to the buffalo news identifying himself as agnostic however he took the last rites administered by a priest just before his execution father charles smith ministered to mcveigh in his last moments in death row motivations for the bombingedit why mcveigh told us at eloquent length but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic crazed monster  who had done it for the kicks —gore vidal  mcveigh claimed that the bombing was revenge against the government for the sieges at waco texas and ruby ridge mcveigh visited waco during the standoff while there he was interviewed by student reporter michelle rauch a senior journalism major at southern methodist university who was writing for the school paper mcveigh expressed his objections over what was happening there  mcveigh frequently quoted and alluded to the white supremacist novel the turner diaries he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms photocopies of pages sixtyone and sixtytwo of the turner diaries were found in an envelope inside mcveighs car these pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the us capitol in washington in a word essay dated march  from the federal maximumsecurity prison at florence colorado mcveigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was morally equivalent to us military actions against iraq and other foreign countries the handwritten essay submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine media bypass was distributed worldwide by the associated press on may   this was written in the midst of the  iraq disarmament crisis and a few months before operation desert fox the administration has said that iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons weapons of mass destruction — mainly because they have used them in the past well if thats the standard by which these matters are decided then the us is the nation that set the precedent the us has stockpiled these same weapons and more for over  years the us claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its cold war with the soviet union why then it is invalid for iraq to claim the same reason deterrence with respect to iraqs real war with and the continued threat of its neighbor iran the administration claims that iraq has used these weapons in the past weve all seen the pictures that show a kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons but have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from hiroshima or nagasaki i suggest that one study the histories of world war i world war ii and other regional conflicts that the us has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of weapons of mass destruction remember dresden how about hanoi tripoli baghdad what about the big ones — hiroshima and nagasaki at these two locations the us killed at least  noncombatants — mostly women and children — in the blink of an eye thousands more took hours days weeks or months to die if saddam is such a demon and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of mass destruction — like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above the truth is the us has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction the essay which marked the first time that mcveigh publicly discussed the oklahoma city bombing continued hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children in oklahoma city it was family convenience that explained the presence of a daycare center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building yet when discussion shifts to iraq any daycare center in a government building instantly becomes a shield think about it when considering morality and mens rea criminal intent in light of these facts i ask who are the true barbarians  i find it ironic to say the least that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on iraq is dubbed the spirit of oklahoma this leads me to a final and unspoken moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction when a us plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise what a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake unfortunately the morality of killing is not so superficial the truth is the use of a truck a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself these are weapons of mass destruction — and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons whether you wish to admit it or not when you approve morally of the bombing of foreign targets by the us military you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in oklahoma city  mcveigh included photocopies of a famous vietnam warera picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs and of nuclear devastation in japan he said in a preface that the essay was intended to provoke thought — and was not written with malevolent intent on april   mcveigh wrote a letter to fox news i explain herein why i bombed the murrah federal building in oklahoma city which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack mcveigh read unintended consequences and said that if it had come out a few years earlier he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a war of attrition against the government instead of bombing a federal building accomplicesedit mcveighs accomplice terry nichols was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime at nichols trial evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved several residents of central kansas including real estate agent georgia rucker and a retired army nco testified at terry nichols federal trial that they had seen two trucks at geary lake state park where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled the retired nco said he visited the lake on april   but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively the operator of the dreamland motel testified that two ryder trucks had been parked outside her grandview plaza motel where mcveigh stayed in room  the weekend before the bombing terry nichols is incarcerated at adx florence in florence colorado an atf informant carol howe told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of elohim city oklahoma were planning a major bombing attack mcveigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time other than this speeding ticket there is no evidence of a connection between mcveigh and members of the midwest bank robbers at elohim city in february  the fbi announced it would review its investigation after learning that agents in the investigation of the midwest bank robbers an alleged aryanoriented gang had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger the oklahoma city bomb agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the midwest bank robbers investigation mcveigh declined further delays and maintained until his death that he had acted alone in the bombing some witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect and there was a search for a john doe  but none was ever found see alsoedit united states
