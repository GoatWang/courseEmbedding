gale pa  overcoming floridas work product privilege to obtain photographs — florida injury attorney blawg — january   free consultation gale tap here to call us florida injury attorney blawg published by jeffrey p gale pa florida injury attorney blawg january   jeffrey p gale pa  overcoming florida’s work product privilege to obtain photographs by jeffrey p gale pa with fault being a fundamental element in all but strict liability personal injury cases it is often critically important for both sides of a dispute to be able to view certain photographs taken after an accident to help piece together the how and why of its occurrence common examples include accidentscene images showing the resting place of vehicles involved in a multivehicle collision or a condition alleged to have caused a fall very often only one side has the photographs and sometimes the party refuses to share them with the other side citing work product privilege as the basis florida rule of civil procedure b provides that a party may discover work product upon a showing of need and an inability to obtain the substantial equivalent without undue hardship in wackenhut corp v crantheisz enters  sod  fla d dca  a property damage case involving a dispute over where within a complex of buildings a fire had started only one of the two parties had photographs of a key warehouse area citing work product the party with the photographs refused to produce them on a petition for writ of certiorari florida’s second dca ordered production of the photographs reasoning as follows since the warehouse has been replaced the scene cannot be reproduced citing dodson v persell  sod  fla  we find that wackenhut has demonstrated exceptional circumstances regarding the photographs and authorize their discovery in florida power corp v dunn  sod  fla d dca  florida power sought discovery of photographs taken at the scene of an accident when its motion was denied by the trial court florida power filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the district court although the district court agreed that the photographs were protected work product it held that florida power was entitled to production of these photographs because it met its burden under florida rule of civil procedure b the predecessor to b by demonstrating exceptional circumstances and its inability to obtain the materials by other means likewise in kmart corporation v sundmacher  sod  fla rd dca  a slipandfall case kmart’s petition for certiorari seeking reversal of the trial court’s order denying its motion to compel production of accident scene photographs was granted by the district court the court ruled as follows because kmart has satisfied the requirements of rule b by demonstrating that the photographs in the plaintiff’s possession are relevant and material they allegedly depict the condition of the floor at the time the plaintiff slipped and fell there is no other means of obtaining the discovery requested no other photographs were taken of the scene ten years ago when the incident allegedly occurred and the photographs are the best evidence of the condition of the floor at the time of the alleged slip and fall the trial court departed from the essential requirements of the law in denying kmart’s request for production because there is no substitute for the information kmart seeks and no way on plenary appellate review of evaluating how the information may have affected the case kmart has demonstrated irreparable harm and the petition should be granted see criswell  sod at  ruiz v steiner  sod  fla d dca  carroll  sod at  colonial penn  sod at  in our experience most parties turn over such photographs without lodging the work product objection reasonable lawyers know the law and understand the importance of certain photographs to the case unfortunately some lawyers prefer to engage in obstructionist tactics in the slim hope of denying justice more likely it’s an opportunity to bill the client we are currently involved in a catastrophic injury case against such a lawyer he has refused to turn over the only postaccident damage photographs of his client’s vehicle which were taken at the scene by his client using a cell phone our client was run off the road and struck a tree she was airlifted to the hospital and thus was in no condition to take photographs at the scene we are awaiting a court date to compel production of the photographs this lawyer has also refused to provide cell phone information to determine if his client was using his phone at the time of the crash we are seeking this material as well a third driver readily produced through her lawyer photographs of her vehicle taken at the repair shop sadly not all lawyers are decent people important note judges will require more than unverified claims that the seeking party is unable to obtain the substantial equivalent of the work product material without undue hardship at the very least the attorney for the moving party should file a verified motion in which the claim is asserted in addition at the hearing on the motion the lawyer should ask the judge to swear him or her in so as to add greater import to the allegations of need and hardship finally affidavits of people in the know can be used to establish the moving party’s position the work product privilege sits on highly
