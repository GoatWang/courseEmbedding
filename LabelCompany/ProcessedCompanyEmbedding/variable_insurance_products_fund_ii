funds schedule of investments  derivative instruments risk exposures and the use of derivative instruments the fund used derivative instruments derivatives including futures contracts in order to meet its investment objectives the strategy is to use derivatives to increase returns and to manage exposure to certain risks as defined below the success of any strategy involving derivatives depends on analysis of numerous economic factors and if the strategies for investment do not work as intended the fund may not achieve its objectives the funds use of derivatives increased or decreased its exposure to the following risk equity risk equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk whether caused by factors specific to an individual investment its issuer or all factors affecting all instruments traded in a market or market segment the fund is also exposed to additional risks from investing in derivatives such as liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk liquidity risk is the risk that the fund will be unable to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty will not be able to fulfill its obligation to the fund the funds maximum risk of loss from counterparty credit risk is generally the aggregate unrealized appreciation and unpaid counterparty payments in excess of any collateral pledged by the counterparty to the fund counterparty risk related to exchangetraded futures contracts is minimal because of the protection provided by the exchange on which they trade derivatives involve to varying degrees risk of loss in excess of the amounts recognized in the statement of assets and liabilities futures contracts a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specified underlying instrument for a fixed price at a specified future

risk exposures and the use of derivative instruments the fund used derivative instruments derivatives including futures contracts in order to meet its investment objectives the strategy is to use

risk is generally the aggregate unrealized appreciation and unpaid counterparty payments in excess of any collateral pledged by the counterparty to the fund counterparty risk related to exchangetraded

value may include market or security specific events the frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent the value used for net asset value nav calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities the fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels as shown below level   quoted prices in active markets for identical investments level   other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for
