reported actual results may differ from these estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments   stockbased compensation   the company adopts fasb accounting standards codification topic  compensation – stock compensation “asc topic ” using the fair value method under asc topic  the stockbased compensation is measured using the blackscholes optionpricing model on the date of grant under the modified prospective method the fair value of stockbased compensation that are expected to vest are recognized using the straightline method over the requisite service period   income taxes   income taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc topic  “income taxes” “asc topic ” under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date   asc  prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize measure present and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return under asc  tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts   net loss per share   the company calculates net loss per share in accordance with asc topic  “earnings per share” basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive

instruments   the carrying value of the company’s financial instruments cash and cash equivalents prepayments other payables and accrued liabilities and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the shortterm nature of these financial instruments   the company also follows the guidance of the asc topic  “ fair value measurements and disclosures ” “asc ” with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value asc  establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows     level  observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets       level  inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and       level  unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions   fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates   foreign currency translation   transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated

financial disclosure   none   item a controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules ae and de as of june   the “evaluation date” this evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the evaluation date as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting discussed below   disclosure controls and procedures are those controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   notwithstanding the assessment that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in this report we believe that our financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended june   fairly present our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in all material respects   management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting   our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules af and df under the exchange act for the company   internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control and accordingly even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect material misstatements in addition effective internal control at a point in time may become ineffective in future periods because of changes in conditions or due to deterioration in the degree of compliance with our established policies and procedures            a material weakness is a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in there being a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected   under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework set forth in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on its evaluation under this framework management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the evaluation date   management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of evaluation date and identified the following material weaknesses   inadequate segregation of duties  we have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures   insufficient written policies  procedures we have insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting   inadequate financial statement closing process we have an inadequate financial statement closing process   lack of audit committee the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the company’s board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures   management is committed to improving its internal controls and will  continue to use third party specialists to address shortfalls in staffing and to assist the company with accounting and finance responsibilities  increase the frequency of independent reconciliations of significant accounts which will mitigate the lack of segregation of duties until there are sufficient personnel and  prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists for financial reporting and closing processes and  may consider appointing outside directors and audit committee members in the future   management including our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer has discussed the material weakness noted above with our independent registered public accounting firm due to the nature of this material weakness there is a more than remote likelihood that misstatements which could be material to the annual or interim financial statements could occur that would not be prevented or detected   this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the sec that permit us to provide only management’s report in this annual report   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last quarter ended june   that have materially affected or that are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   limitations on the effectiveness of controls and procedures   our management including our chief executive officer and the chief financial officer do not expect that the our controls and procedures will prevent all potential errors or fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met            part iii   item  directors executive officers promoters and control persons compliance with section a of the exchange act   a directors and executive officers

currently under any legal obligation to establish a compensation committee and have elected not to do so at this time in the future we may establish a compensation committee if the board determines it to be advisable or we are otherwise required to do so by applicable law rule or regulation during the year ended june   our board did not employ any outside consultants to assist in carrying out its responsibilities with respect to executive compensation although we have access to general executive compensation information regarding both local and national industry compensation practices in future periods we may participate in regional and national surveys that benchmark executive compensation by peer group factors such as company size annual revenues market capitalization and geographical location   the executive employment market in general is very competitive due to the number of companies with whom we compete to attract and retain executive and other staff with the requisite skills and experience to carry out our strategy and to maintain compliance with multiple federal and state regulatory agencies many of these companies have significantly greater economic resources than our own our board has recognized that our compensation packages must be able to attract and retain highly talented individuals that are committed to our goals and objectives without at this time paying cash salaries that are competitive with some of our peers with greater economic resources our compensation structure is weighted towards equity compensation in the form of options to acquire common stock which the board believes motivates and encourages executives to pursue strategic opportunities while managing the risks involved in our current business stage and aligns compensation incentives with value creation for our shareholders            components of our executive compensation program   our executive compensation program incorporates components we believe are necessary in order for the company to provide a competitive compensation package relative to our peers and to provide an appropriate mix between shortterm and longterm cash and noncash compensation elements of our executive compensation are listed below      ● base salary         ● stock awards         ● other benefits available to all employees         ● items specific to our president and chief executive officer per an employment agreement   base salary at present we do not have a salary structure for employees and executives is based on skill set knowledge and responsibilities base salaries may be established as necessary during the year ended june   none of our named executive officers received a salary increase   stock awards a portion of compensation paid to our executives is equity based we believe equity compensation helps align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders in that regard our executives’ compensation is subject to downside risk in the event that our common stock price decreases in addition we believe stock awards provide incentives to aid in the retention of key executives   other benefits our executive officers and employees receive no other benefits   item  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management   class   beneficial owner   position   amount and nature of beneficial owner        of class
