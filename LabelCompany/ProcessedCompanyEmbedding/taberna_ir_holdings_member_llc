page single member limited liability companies an llc is an entity created by state statute depending on elections made by the llc and the number of members the irs will treat an llc either as a corporation partnership or as part of the owners tax return a disregarded entity specifically a domestic llc with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless it files form  and affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation and an llc with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner for income tax purposes but as a separate entity for purposes of employment tax and certain excise taxes unless it files form  and affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation owner of singlemember llc if a singlemember llc does not elect to be treated as a corporation the llc is a disregarded entity and the llcs activities should be reflected on its owners federal tax return if the owner is an individual the activities of the llc will generally be reflected on form  schedule c profit or loss from business sole proprietorship pdf form  schedule e supplemental income or loss pdf form  schedule f profit or loss from farming pdf an individual owner of a singlemember llc that operates a trade or business is subject to the tax on net earnings from self employment in the same manner as a sole proprietorship if the singlemember llc is owned by a corporation or partnership the llc should be reflected on its owners federal tax return as a division of the corporation or partnership taxpayer identification number for federal income tax purposes a singlemember llc classified as a disregarded entity generally must use the owners social security number ssn or ein for all information returns and reporting related to income tax for example if a disregarded entity llc that is owned by an individual is required to provide a form w request for taxpayer identification number and certification the w should provide the owner’s ssn or ein not the llc’s ein however for certain employment tax and excise tax requirements discussed below the ein of the llc must be used instead therefore an llc will need an ein if it has any employees or if it will be required to file any of the excise tax forms listed below thus most new singlemember llcs classified as disregarded entities will need to obtain an ein an llc applies for an ein by filing form ss application for employer identification number see form ss for information on applying for an ein a singlemember llc that is a disregarded entity that does not have employees and does not have an excise tax liability does not need an ein it should use the name and tin of the single member owner for federal tax purposes however if a singlemember llc whose taxable income and loss will be reported by the single member owner nevertheless needs an ein to open a bank account or if state tax law requires the singlemember llc to have a federal ein then the llc can apply for and obtain an ein employment tax and certain excise tax requirements in august  final regulations td  pdf were issued requiring disregarded llcs to be treated as the taxpayer for certain excise taxes accruing on or after january   and employment taxes accruing on or after january   singlemember disregarded llcs will continue to be disregarded for other federal tax purposes a singlemember llc that is classified as a disregarded entity for income tax purposes is treated as a separate entity for purposes of employment tax and certain excise taxes for wages paid after january   the singlemember llc is required to use its name and employer identification number ein for reporting and payment of employment taxes a singlemember llc is also required to use its name and ein to register for excise tax activities on form  pay and report excise taxes reported on forms    and c and claim any refunds credits and payments on form  see the employment and excise tax returns for more information joint ownership of llc by spouse in community property states rev proc  addressed the issue of classification for an entity that is solely owned by husband and wife as community property under laws of a state a foreign country or possession of the united states if there is a qualified entity owned by a husband and wife as community property owners and they treat the entity as a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes the internal revenue service will accept the position that the entity is disregarded for federal tax purposes partnership for federal tax purposes the internal revenue service will accept the position that the entity is partnership for federal tax purposes a change in the reporting position will be treated for federal tax purposes as a conversion of the entity a business entity is a qualified entity if the business entity is wholly owned by a husband and wife as community property under the laws of a state a foreign country or possession of the united states no person other than one or both spouses would be considered an owner for federal tax purposes and the business entity is not treated as a corporation under irc § note if an llc is owned by husband and wife in a noncommunity property state the llc should file as a partnership llcs owned by a husband and wife are not eligible to be qualified joint ventures which can elect not be
