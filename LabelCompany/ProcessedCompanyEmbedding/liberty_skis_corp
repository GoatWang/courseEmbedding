company what we do liberty makes high performance skis rooted in functional innovation and respect for the environment every material we use and design we produce is done with the ultimate goal of elevating your experience on skis liberty skis perform so well because they are designed and built without regard to marketing hype or the latest trend we test all our designs and materials ourselves to see if they improve the way our skis ride in a variety of conditions if they do not improve the ski experience then they don’t go in our skis a great example of functional innovation is our exclusive use of bamboo laminate cores in our skis liberty was the first and remains the only ski company to use bamboo in all our skis bamboo is strong light eco friendly and gives our skis a unique stability and liveliness not found with any other material bamboo helps you ski better combining unique designs and the best materials available we hand build skis to exacting standards allowing liberty to offer the best warranty in the industry at  years we hand select bamboo from southern china edges from germany bases from france adhesives from the us high tech composites from germany topsheets from austria and plastics from japan to create the most fun and versatile skis available why we do it more than just our name liberty is the reason we make skis and what we seek in the mountains snow is where we find freedom if you find a better job let us know where we are the location of liberty hq high in the colorado rockies affords us the chance to test our skis in a wide variety of conditions over a long season with access to an incredible diversity of terrain from worldclass parks to massive backcountry lines and everything in between our designs flow directly from our surroundings liberty makes versatile light and tough skis that work in powder on hardpack slung on a backpack for a long hike in the park setup for tele turns or just our ripping around your local area who we are liberty is a collection riders from every imaginable background we have powder whores racers former snowboarders tele purists park rats and a bunch of people who just go ski type and

faq search the liberty difference ethic at liberty we make skis like our lives depend on them every ski is designed and tested in the heart of the colorado mountains we start with the best materials from around the world handbuild each pair and back them with the best warranty in the business our goal is to make the best skis possible treat our customers like our ski partners and continue to do what we love design philosophy liberty has won awards from every major ski publication over the last ten years but more important has won the trust of countless skiers across the globe we design skis based on the concept of functional innovation this simply means we don’t add materials or features to our skis unless they improve the ski experience on snow our innovations are not included for marketing purposes but because they will help you ski better longer and faster in real world conditions in ski design simple strong and light leads to the best products materials we use the best materials available from around the world and we never stop looking for ways to improve our skis every component we use in our skis is there because we believe it is the best answer to a specific design challenge we use bamboo because it is the lightest most durable and most responsive core material available we use uhmw pe for our sidewalls because it absorbs impact better than abs and leads to a smooth ride at higher speeds our bases are ptex   and  electra because they are the highest quality fastest bases made all edges are custom made in germany with a wider profile larger anchors and  different hardness ratings to be the most durable for their intended purpose liberty uses a unique quadaxial sglass for our glass fiber adding another axis of torsional reinforcement compared to most materials additional vibration reduction and top edge durability is provided by a durathane polyurethane layer not found in other skis we use titanal and frp mats for additional stiffness and binding screw retention because they are the best materials to use in those applications liberty skis feel different because they are different we are not just another brand at some big factory look at the materials in most skis and you will find the same stuff the major brand that owns the factory uses there is no difference in design or materials from brand to brand we are free to experiment and use whatever works best without regard to what others are doing about bamboo liberty is the market leader in bamboo technology and we use this tough ecofriendly material in all our skis liberty has been designing skis around our resilient and light bamboo laminate cores for more than ten years and even though many companies have followed our lead we remain the bamboo experts bamboo is one of the fastest growing plants on earth and can be sustainably harvested without killing the entire organism the roots stay in the ground when the top is cut they help control erosion and then sprout again to be harvested in  years this leaves the forest canopy intact helps sequester carbon and creates a sustainable cycle for our raw materials on top of the environmental benefits bamboo also happens to make a great ski core bamboo has a tensile strength that rivals that of steel and a very high coefficient of restitution meaning that it will snap back to its’ original shape time after time that is why our skis have such an energetic lively feel partners we work with our partners because they are the best at what they do it is that simple we believe we make the best skis on the planet and want our customers to have the best accessories to match their liberty skis tyrolia makes our bindings and they are the largest binding brand in the world with unsurpassed quality safety and performance they are great at what they do and listened to our requests for a new freeride style at binding with low ramp angle pole control mode adjustment and high din the adrenalin is the best freeride at binding you can buy komperdell makes some of the most innovative and highest tech ski poles in the world we partnered with them to produce our super light bamboo and carbon fiber pole and a new adjustable at pole we don’t just make standard aluminum tubes but speciallydesigned poles that each answers a specific need for our customers graphics you won’t find wizards or pistols or fanciful unicorns on our skis just original artwork by people who actually live in the mountains we work with our artists to create images that are evocative of the alpine experience and that are also nice to look at when they emerge from the powder we sublimate or direct print the images into the backside of the topsheet to ensure the artwork looks good year after year final word we appreciate all the support over the past many years we have had a lot of fun and learned some things along the way we hope to see you in the mountains soon and we hope you will continue to trust us to make equipment for

contact us chat live chat email us helplevelninesportscom toll free in north america  international  learn center contact us   home  free binding mounting nbsp yep we mount your bindings we are happy to say that binding mounting is included in your purchase of any ski and binding on our website what is binding mounting if this is your first time buying skis and bindings you might not know what we are talking about ski bindings are mounted by literally drilling holes in to the proper position on skis based on your boot size this is why we ask for information after checkout plenty of other places you can buy skis and bindings online dont mount the bindings for you and you will be left looking for a local shop to do it anyway we hope you appreciate the service and here is a little more detailed information for purchases without boots in the order if you are getting just skis and bindings you will be prompted for your boot or shoe size if you have adjustable bindings this information is not necessary but you can still provide it the bindings will still need to be adjusted to your boots by someone locally who can test the release of the bindings based upon the actual boots being used this is a quick and usually inexpensive process the difficult and expensive part is the mounting of the bindings for purchases with boots if you also are buying a pair of boots a longer form asking for the skier height weight age and ability level this information allows us to adjust the bindings for the skier so that you can take the gear from the box to the slopes this free service saves both time and money and we strongly suggest you take a chance on the best boot fit we have for you foreign orders which are difficult and expensive to return therefore you should not guess with boot sizing you should only buy what you are certain will fit remember this form will be available after checkout is complete when you complete the form a copy will be emailed to you to verify that you entered the information correctly sometimes you may choose a skibootbinding package that is incompatible if your package is incompatible we will notify you of suggested changes if they are obvious and there is no color or price difference we will sometimes just make the change shop skis shop ski bindings shop ski boots level nine info  faqs level nine sports  about us salt lake city retail
