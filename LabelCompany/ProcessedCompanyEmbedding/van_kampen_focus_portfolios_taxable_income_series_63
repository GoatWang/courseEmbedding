the laws of the state of new york pursuant to a trust indenture and trust agreement the trust agreement dated the date of this prospectus the initial date of deposit among van kampen funds inc as sponsor van kampen asset management as supervisor and the bank of new york as trustee and in certain cases as evaluator or their predecessors effective april   american portfolio evaluation services a division of van kampen investment advisory corp resigned as evaluator and the bank of new york was appointed successor evaluator the trust offers the opportunity to purchase units representing proportionate interests in a portfolio of equity securities the trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of common stocks with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually on the initial date of deposit the sponsor deposited delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase of the securities and an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the trustee in exchange for these contracts the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust unless otherwise terminated as provided in the trust agreement the trust will terminate on the mandatory termination date and any remaining securities will be liquidated or distributed by the trustee within a reasonable time as used in this prospectus the term securities means the securities including contracts to purchase these securities listed in the portfolio in part one and any additional securities deposited into the trust additional units may be issued at any time by depositing in the trust i additional securities ii contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or iii cash or a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by the trust the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the trust following the initial date of deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain as nearly as practicable the same percentage relationship among the number of shares of each security in the trusts portfolio as existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement the trust consists of a the securities including contracts for the purchase thereof listed under the portfolio in part one as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the related income and capital accounts neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities objectives and securities selection  the objective of the trust is to provide capital appreciation and dividend income the trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of stocks of companies which may include united states domestic electric utilities natural gas utilities water utilities telecommunications companies real estate investment trusts technology companies health care companies consumer products companies consumer cyclicals companies consumer staples companies energy companies industrials companies or financial services companies the portfolio consists of securities selected by research analysts at edward d jones  co lp the underwriter and approved by the sponsor in selecting the securities the following factors among others were considered dividend yield geographic diversification earnings growth rates regulatory climate and stock valuation at the time the securities were selected the underwriters research analysts were currently covering all the issuers of the securities and had published favorable recommendations for each of them there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue for any issuer during the life of the trust or that the report on any such issuer will continue to be favorable a downgrade in an analysts recommendation for an issuer or the termination of such coverage could negatively affect the performance of the trust you should note that the selection criteria were applied to the securities for inclusion in the trust as of the initial date of deposit after this date the securities may no longer meet the selection criteria should a security no longer meet the selection criteria we will generally not remove the security from the portfolio in offering the units to the public neither the sponsor nor any brokerdealers are recommending any of the individual securities but rather the entire pool of securities taken as a whole which are represented by the units telecommunications the emergence of a global networked economy appears to be changing the face of the telecommunications industry telecommunications companies provide local long distance and wireless telephone as well as cable television and internet services and information systems manufacture telecommunications products and operate voice data and telecommunications networks as the technology driving this industry group continues to develop and evolve telecommunications companies could continue to grow in both customer base and services offered financial services the trust may invest significantly in financial services companies many banks insurance companies and other financial services companies have recently made changes in the products they offer the financial services industry has experienced a high level of consolidations mergers and acquisitions as well as other regulatory issues this industry group may be appealing for reasons such as deregulation of the banking industry and accelerated earnings growth these factors can potentially provide advantages to those investing in this industry group utilities the environment of the electric natural gas and water utility industry appears to be adapting to include recent changes in regulatory requirements as well as technological changes in the past this industry was fraught with government mandated monopolies today many states are deregulating their utilities which may result in lowering some of the barriers to competition additionally utility companies appear to be expanding their services and offerings to include other retail services not traditionally offered the growth and expansion occurring could potentially continue as the utility industry proceeds through these transformations real estate investment trusts a real estate investment trust or reit is a company that buys develops finances andor manages incomeproducing real estate such as apartments shopping centers offices and warehouses a reit can be a good way to invest in commercial real estate compared to traditional direct investments in real estate which may be difficult to sell and value reits are traded on major stock exchanges making them highly liquid reit investors also gain the advantage of skilled management since reit management teams tend to be experts within their specific property or geographic niches many believe that the attractive features of property ownership and stock ownership are combined in this investment vehicle reits can provide investors with current income as they are currently required to distribute  of taxable income annually and can have the potential for attractive returns they have historically had low relative volatility and may provide inflation protection consumer staples consumer staples is a relatively mature industry with growth in line with population growth recent waves of consolidation in the industry have reduced the number of competitors which has enabled product price increases in some sectors additionally product innovation has proven key to growth and should lead to aboveindustry growth rates for successful companies the industry is characterized primarily by stable highprofit margin companies several of which pay attractive dividends industrials the industrials industry includes capital goods commercial services and transportation companies generally growth prospects for the industry are tied to economic factors such as consumer and business spending us gross domestic product and exports to foreign nations the increasingly global economy should increase the demand for industrial products made by us firms within capital goods defense and electronics are some of the fastest growing areas given the political support for higher government spending on defense initiatives many industrials companies are wellestablished and have demonstrated a track record of paying dividends and increasing the amount of dividends paid over time health care an aging population new drug development and product innovation should drive growth for this industry additionally foreign demand for health care particularly from developing nations continues to increase the industry has historically grown at a rate faster than the overall economy and that trend should continue research and development spending supported by strong demand should lead to new

aboveaverage growth include niche retailing entertainment and media many companies within this sector are becoming more dividendsfocused and may increase their dividends going forward consumer products consumer products is a relatively mature industry with growth inline with population growth recent waves of consolidation in the industry have reduced the number of competitors which has

can impact the value of the securities in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security of the issuer even though your trust is supervised you should remember that we do not manage your trust your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time financial services companies the trust invests significantly in banks insurance companies and other financial services companies banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the equity market in general adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence the financial health of customers equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other natural or manmade disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulation or tax law changes utility companies many utility companies especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies are subject to various uncertainties including o risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs o restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations o regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer o coping with the general effects of energy conservation o technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete o the effects of local weather maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors o the potential impact of natural or manmade disasters o difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital even if frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions o the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation o difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities and o increased competition any of these factors or a combination of these factors could affect the supply of or demand for energy such as electricity or natural gas or water or the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the securities and the performance of the trust utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels in the united states at the federal level the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc the federal trade commission the ftc the securities and exchange commission the sec and the nuclear regulatory commission the nrc have authority to oversee electric and combination electric and gas utilities the value of utility company stocks may decline because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change this regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost increases to its customers which could hinder the utility companys ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by its creditors against such utility company in  two california public utilities were threatened with such action by their wholesale suppliers and one of these utilities filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  of the us bankruptcy code of  furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price in late  a trader and marketer of utilities commodities and financial and risk management services filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  as a result of being negatively impacted by several of these and other factors mergers in the utility industry may require approval from several federal and state regulatory agencies including ferc the ftc and the sec these regulatory authorities could as a matter of policy reverse the trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult or cause delay in the merger process any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to fall real estate investment trusts many factors can have an adverse impact on the performance of a particular reit including its cash available for distribution the credit quality of a particular reit or the real estate industry generally the success of reits depends on various factors including occupancy and rent levels appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents on those properties economic recession overbuilding tax law changes higher interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact reits and their future earnings and share prices risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include among other factors o general us and global as well as local economic conditions o decline in real estate values o the financial health of tenants o overbuilding and increased competition for tenants o oversupply of properties for sale o changing demographics o changes in interest rates tax rates and other operating expenses o changes in government regulations o changes in zoning laws o the ability of the owner to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance o faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements o the cost of complying with the americans with disabilities act o regulatory and judicial requirements including relating to liability for environmental hazards o natural or manmade disasters o changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties o changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand and o the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates acceptable to developers variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and reits in particular properties owned by a reit may not be adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental liabilities including remediation costs you should also be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects the real estate industry may be cyclical and if the trust acquires reit securities at or near the top of the cycle there is increased risk of a decline in value of the reit securities and therefore the value of the units reits are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the markets perception of the reit industry generally because of their structure and the legal requirement that they distribute at least  of their taxable income to shareholders annually reits require frequent amounts of new funding through both borrowing money and issuing stock thus reits historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new equity shares or equivalents to purchase or build new properties this may have adversely affected reit equity share market prices both existing and new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future especially when reits continue to issue stock when real estate prices are relatively high and stock prices are relatively low consumer staples the trust may invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer staples general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy or other change which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits furthermore the failure to continue developing new products lack of or reduced market acceptance of new and existing products increased raw materials costs an inability to raise prices increased or changed regulation and product liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock prices of the issuers of securities in this industry group industrials the trust may invest significantly in industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consolidation domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials labor relations government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts or changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel the number of housing starts levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment manufacturers health care issuers the trust may invest significantly in health care companies these issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotec hnology managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies these companies face substantial government regulation and approval procedures congress and the president have proposed and in some cases approved a variety of legislative changes concerning health care issuers from time to time including but not limited to cost and prescription drug price controls and more rigorous approval processes for new pharmaceuticals and devices additional government regulation or any change in existing regulation can have a significantly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of products and services drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come to market the research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial this process involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval these companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years if at all the failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative impact on a company and its stock energy issuers the trust may invest significantly in energy companies energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing regions such as the middle east the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels the ability to find and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable operating hazards government regulation and the level of consumer demand political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on your investment oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile opec controls a substantial portion of world oil production opec may take actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil various domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these prices any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on energy companies energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional energy reserves the exploration and recovery process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly an energy company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be economically recoverable the industry also faces substantial government regulation including environmental regulation these regulations have increased costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny technology companies technology companies face risks related to rapidly changing technology rapid product obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions an unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a technology company the failure of a technology company to introduce new products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the companys results technology stocks tend to experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading announcements about new products technologies operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to fluctuate dramatically at times however extreme price and volume fluctuations may occur in the securities of companies in this industry group that are unrelated to the operating performance of the company the market for certain products may have only recently begun to develop is rapidly evolving or is characterized by an increase in suppliers key components of some technology products are available only from limited sources this can impact the cost of and ability to acquire these components some technology companies service highly concentrated customer bases of only a limited number of large companies any failure to meet the standards of these customers could result in a significant loss or reduction in sales many products and technologies are incorporated into other products as a result some companies are sometimes highly dependent on the performance of other technology companies we cannot guarantee that these customers will continue to place additional orders or will place orders in similar quantities as in the past the life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short resulting in volatile sales earnings and stock prices for many technology companies additionally with the rapid evolution of technologies competitive advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls historically many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the consumer as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or pricing power some of the large technology companies have been involved in antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future a slowdown in corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company revenues technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part of their revenues any economic slowdown could hurt revenues consumer cyclicals the success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is subject to severe competition therefore the success of consumer cyclicals companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy interest rates competition and consumer confidence a slowdown in the economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry the success of companies in the consumer cyclicals segment is also strongly affected by changes in demographics and consumer tastes consumer products the trust may invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits furthermore the failure to continue developing new products lack of or reduced market acceptance of new and existing products increased raw materials costs an inability to raise prices increased or changed regulation and product liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock prices of the issuers of securities in this industry group telecommunications companies the trust invests significantly in telecommunications companies these companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation for example the united states government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer this industry has experienced substantial deregulation in recent years deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by the trust competitive pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility certain telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than larger established issuers smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade in lower volumes than larger companies as a result the prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of other issuers no fdic guarantee an investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank and is

redemptions any publication of a list of securities or a list of anticipated securities to be included in the trust may also cause increased buying activity in certain securities once this information becomes public investors may purchase individual securities appearing in such a publication and may do so during or prior to the initial offering of units it is possible that these investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the sponsor the underwriter or the affiliates of either of them or firms that are distributing units this activity may cause the trust to purchase

per unit may be shown under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part one the estimate of the income a trust may receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an issuer the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or scheduled income payments in all cases accounting for any applicable foreign withholding taxes the actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during a trusts life dividend and income conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividendsincome paid or declared over several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions the actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in a trusts fees and expenses in actual income received by a trust currency fluctuations and with changes in a trust such as the acquisition call maturity or sale of securities due to these and various other factors actual income received by a trust will most likely differ from the most recent dividends or scheduled income payments reinvestment option unitholders may have distributions automatically reinvested in additional units under the automatic

of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor assets of the trust the trust is expected to hold one or more of the following i shares of stock in corporations the stocks that are treated as equity for federal income tax purposes and ii equity interests in real estate investment trusts the reit shares that constitute interests in entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes it is possible that the trust will also hold other assets including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those described above in which case you will have federal income tax consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section all of the assets held by the trust constitute the trust assets neither our counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the trust assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal income tax treatment of the trust assets trust status if the trust is at all times operated in accordance with the documents establishing the trust and certain requirements of federal income tax law are met the trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of each of the trust assets and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg dividends and capital gains if any from each trust asset when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into additional units in addition the income from trust assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or trust expenses your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units including sales charges among the trust assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units for example in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporations accumulated earnings and profits or in the case of certain distributions with respect to reit shares that represent a return of capital as discussed below if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered unrecaptured section  gain which may be the case for example with some capital gains attributable to the reit shares is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of  in the case of capital gains dividends the determination of which portion of the capital gains dividend if any is subject to the  tax rate will be made based on rules prescribed by the united states treasury dividends from stocks certain dividends received with respect to the stocks may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied these special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   dividends from reit shares some dividends on the reit shares may be designated as capital gain dividends generally taxable to you as longterm capital gains if you hold a unit for six months or less or if your trust holds a reit share for six months or less any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such reit share will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed to have been received with respect to such reit share distributions of income or capital gains declared on the reit shares in october november or december will be deemed to have been paid to you on december  of the year they are declared even when paid by the reit during the following january other dividends on the reit shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income although in limited circumstances some of the ordinary income dividends from a reit may also qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied these special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from real estate investment trusts generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received by the trust because the dividends received deduction is not available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from reits inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may request an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units or at your trusts termination by electing to receive an inkind distribution you will receive trust assets plus possibly cash you will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole trust assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same trust assets held by your trust however if you also receive cash in exchange for a trust asset or a fractional portion of a trust asset you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such trust asset or fractional portion exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical trust assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income foreign taxes distributions by your trust that are treated as us source income eg dividends received on stocks of domestic corporations will generally be subject to us income taxation and withholding in the case of units held by nonresident alien individuals foreign corporations or other nonus persons subject to any applicable treaty if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some of the income from your trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes you should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other us tax withholding and reporting requirements some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any income withheld will still be treated as income to you under the grantor trust rules you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign taxes that are paid therefore for us tax purposes you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes new york tax status based on the advice of katten muchin rosenman llp special counsel to the trust for new york tax matters

volatility because the trust invests in common stocks you should understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks and therefore units will fall common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of common stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is not actively managed the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments dividends common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company accordingly common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock financial services an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank insurance and financial services sector in general banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws the impact of these laws on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been enacted in recent years under the legislation banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation may continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the securities in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor the underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor the underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the securities or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence the financial health of customers equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect the stock prices of such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other natural or manmade disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture utility issuers an investment in units of the trust should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the risks which such an investment may entail general problems of the public utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the public service commissions having jurisdiction the difficulty in financing large construction programs during an inflationary period the restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental nuclear safety and other regulatory considerations the difficulty of the capital markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities the difficulty in obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer and the effects of energy conservation there is no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating and other expenses and debt service requirements all of the public utilities which are issuers of the securities have been experiencing many of these problems in varying degrees furthermore utility stocks are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk generally exhibiting an inverse relationship to interest rates as a result electric utility stock prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which for example establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base which must be approved by the state commissions certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time in persuading regulators who are subject to political pressures to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance in addition gas pipeline and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies enforcing or being required to comply with longterm contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers on the one hand or suppliers on the other in  two california public electric utilities claimed inability to meet their obligations to their suppliers in the deregulated wholesale market for electricity due to regulatory restrictions on their ability to pass increasing costs along to their customers in the retail market these defaults led their wholesale suppliers to threaten to institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utility companies subsequently one of the utility companies filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  of the us bankruptcy code of  furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price in late  a trader and marketer of utilities commodities and financial and risk management services filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  as a result of being negatively impacted by several of these and other factors certain of the issuers of the securities may own or operate nuclear generating facilities governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional requirements governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants nuclear generating projects in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases construction delays and licensing difficulties these have been caused by various factors including inflation high financing costs required design changes and rework allegedly faulty construction objections by groups and governmental officials limits on the ability to finance reduced forecasts of energy requirements and economic conditions this experience indicates that the risk of significant cost increases delays and licensing difficulties remain present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear project also nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval to return to service a major accident at a nuclear plant anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation construction or licensing of nuclear units in view of the uncertainties discussed above there can be no assurance that any utility companys share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units the likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described above varies as does the potential severity of any adverse impact it should be recognized however that one or more of such adverse events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a companys financial condition the results of its operations its ability to make interest and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends other general problems of the electric gas and water utility industries including state and local joint action power agencies include rising costs of rail transportation to transport fossil fuels the uncertainty of transmission service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions changes in tax laws which adversely affect a utilitys ability to operate profitably increased competition in service costs recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations uncertain availability and increased cost of capital unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal availability and cost of natural gas for resale technical and cost factors and other problems associated with construction licensing regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive wastes and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of any securities to make dividend payments and the value of such securities on redemption of your units real estate investment trusts the trust will invest in shares issued by reits domestic corporations or business trusts which invest primarily in income producing real estate or real estate related loans or mortgages reits are financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a number of investors in order to participate indirectly in real estate ownership or financing thus an investment in the trust will be subject to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate in addition to securities markets risks because of the trusts investment in the securities of companies in the real estate industry these risks include o declines in the value of real estate o illiquidity of real property investments o risks related to general us and global as well as local economic conditions o dependency on management skill o heavy cash flow dependency o possible lack of availability of mortgage funds o excessive levels of debt or overleveraged financial structure o overbuilding o extended vacancies or obsolescence of properties o increase in competition o increases in property taxes and operating expenses o changes in zoning laws o losses due to costs resulting from the cleanup of environmental problems o liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems o casualty or condemnation losses o natural or manmade disasters o economic or regulatory impediments to raising rents o changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand o changes in the appeal of properties to tenants and o changes in interest rates tax rates or operating expenses in addition to these risks equity reits may be more likely to be affected by changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts further reits are dependent upon the management skills of the issuers and generally may not be diversified the above factors may also adversely affect a borrowers or lessees ability to meet its obligations to the reit in the event of a default by a borrower or lessee the reit may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its investments a significant amount of the assets of a reit may be invested in investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types eg hotels shopping malls residential complexes and office buildings the impact of economic conditions on reits also varies with geographic location and property type variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and reits in particular in addition you should be aware that reits may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects reits are also subject to o defaults by borrowers o the markets perception of the reit industry generally o the possibility of failing to qualify for taxfree passthrough of income under the internal revenue code and o the possibility of failing to maintain exemption from the investment company act of  a default by a borrower or lessee may cause the reit to experience delays in enforcing its rights as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs related to protecting its investments some reits in the trust may be structured as upreits an upreit owns an interest in a partnership that owns real estate this can result in a potential conflict of interest between  shareholders of the reit who may want to sell an asset and  other partnership interest holders who would be subject to tax liability if the reit sells the property in some cases reits have entered into no sell agreements which are designed to avoid taxing the holders of partnership units by preventing the reit from selling the property this arrangement may mean that the reit would refuse a lucrative offer for an asset or be forced to hold on to a poor asset since parties to no sell agreements often do not disclose them the sponsor does not know whether any of the reits in the trust have entered into this kind of arrangement a reit generally maintains comprehensive insurance on presently owned and subsequently acquired real property assets including  liability  fire and  extended coverage however there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes and floods that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable as to which the reits properties are at risk in their particular locales the management of a reit uses its discretion in determining  amounts  coverage limits and  deductibility provisions of insurance they generally aim to acquire appropriate insurance on their investments at reasonable costs and on suitable terms this may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and several other factors might make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds that a reit receives might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to that property under various federal state and local environmental laws ordinances and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on under or in such property such laws often impose liability  whether or not the owner or operator caused or knew of the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances and  whether or not the storage of the substances was in violation of a tenants lease in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances or  the failure to remediate the property properly may hinder the owners ability to borrow using that real property as collateral we cannot give any assurance that one or more of the reits in the trust may not be currently liable or potentially liable for any of these costs in connection with real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire while the shares of those reits are held in the trust consumer staples your trust may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer staples the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits furthermore the failure to continue developing new products lack of or reduced market acceptance of new and existing products increased raw materials costs an inability to raise prices increased or changed regulation and product liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock prices of the issuers of securities in this industry group industrials your trust may invest significantly in industrials companies general risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy intense competition consolidation domestic and international politics excess capacity and consumer spending trends in addition capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels economic cycles technical obsolescence delays in modernization limitations on supply of key materials labor relations government regulations government contracts and ecommerce initiatives furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their individual industries industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new equipment aircraft order cancellations disputes over or ability to obtain or retain government contracts or changes in government budget priorities changes in aircraftleasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel the number of housing starts levels of public and nonresidential construction including weakening demand for new office and retail space and overall construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers health care issuers an investment in units of your trust should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry in general health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and instruments drugs and biotech managed care hospital managementhealth services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the healthcare field these companies are subject to governmental regulation of their products and services a factor which could have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or services furthermore such companies face the risk of increasing competition from new products or services generic drug sales termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete the research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for several years such companies may also have persistent losses during a new products transition from development to production and revenue patterns may be erratic legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in congress from time to time these proposals span a wide range of topics including cost and price controls which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription drugs national health insurance incentives for competition in the provision of healthcare services tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare insurance premiums and promotion of prepaid healthcare plans the sponsor and the underwriter are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals if enacted on the issuers of securities in your portfolio energy issuers energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing regions such as the middle east the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels the ability to find and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable operating hazards government regulation and the level of consumer demand political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on your investment oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile opec controls a substantial portion of world oil production opec may take actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil various domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these prices any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on energy companies energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire additional energy reserves the exploration and recovery process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly an energy company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves will be economically recoverable the industry also faces substantial government regulation including environmental regulation these regulations have increased costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny technology companies the market for technology products and services especially those related to the internet is characterized by rapidly changing technology rapid products obsolescence cyclical market patterns evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions the success of technology companies depends in substantial part on the timely and success introduction of new products an unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuers products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuers operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that companies will be able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace the market for certain technology products and services may have only recently begun to develop is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants additionally certain technology companies may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the public such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited operating history on which to analyze future operating results it is important to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading accordingly there can be no assurance that upon redemption of your units or termination of the trust you will receive an amount greater than or equal to your initial investment based on trading history factors such as announcements of new products or development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to fluctuate substantially in addition technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies this market volatility may adversely affect the market price of the securities and therefore your ability to redeem your units or roll over your units into a new trust at a price equal to or greater than the original price paid for such units some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently available only from a single source there can be no assurance that in the future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner accordingly an issuers operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for or any interruption or reduction in supply of any key components additionally many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or reduction of sales because many products and technology are incorporated into other related products certain companies are often highly dependent on the performance of other computer electronics and communications companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technology with intense competition between companies accordingly a decline in demand for such products or technology from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities the life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short resulting in volatile sales earnings and stock prices for many technology companies additionally with the rapid evolution of technologies competitive advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls historically many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the consumer as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or pricing power some of the large technology companies have been involved in antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future a slowdown in corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company revenues technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part of their revenues any slowdown in international economies could hurt revenues consumer cyclicals the success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is subject to severe competition therefore the success of consumer cyclicals companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international economy and to interest rates competition and consumer confidence a slowdown in the economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry the success of companies in the consumer cyclicals segment are also strongly affected by changes in demographics and consumer tastes consumer products your trust may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits furthermore the failure to continue developing new products lack of or reduced market acceptance of new and existing products increased raw materials costs an inability to raise prices increased or changed regulation and product liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock prices of the issuers of securities in this industry group telecommunications issuers because the portfolio is also concentrated in the telecommunications industry the value of the units may be susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation and the products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence these factors could affect the value of units telephone companies in the united states for example are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise while a portfolio concentrates on the securities of established suppliers of traditional telecommunication products and services the trust may also invest in smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development of new products and services these smaller companies may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation and may also involve greater risk than large established issuers such smaller companies may have limited product lines market or financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the securities of such smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other issuers in addition recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by the trust liquidity whether or not the stocks in the trust are listed on a stock exchange the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an overthecounter market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks we cannot guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid the value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent voting only the trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the trust while you may sell or redeem your units you may not sell or vote the stocks in the trust the sponsor will instruct the trustee how to vote the stocks the trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other shareholders if the
