recorded by singer janis joplin in the early s the tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life its fitting that the renowned german marque figures prominently in the lyric mercedesbenz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement for many its vehicles are sleek symbols of status success and good taste in january of  karl benz unveiled the worlds first automobile a threewheeled vehicle dubbed the benz patent motor car a few months later gottlieb daimler and his chief engineer wilhelm maybach rolled out a fourwheeled vehicle powered by his daimler engine the first mercedes was crafted in  shortly after daimlers death built by maybach the car was commissioned by emil jellinek one of daimlers primary distributors and was ultimately named after jellineks daughter mercedes in  the companies founded by daimler and benz merged to form daimlerbenz ag and the mercedesbenz brand was born the companys insignia was a threepointed star wreathed in a laurel the star was dreamed up by daimler years earlier and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land air and sea right from the start the mercedesbenz name was synonymous with automotive excellence one of the automakers earliest vehicles the  mercedesbenz  distinguished itself as the worlds first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day fourwheel independent suspension the s and s saw mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury thanks to coveted cruisers like the  and k the s witnessed the introduction of the mercedesbenz  sl gullwing a sports car that has been described as being the worlds first supercar with its dramatic styling and racebred technology the  sl reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide the decade also saw daimlerbenz making strides in the area of safety technology the companys mercedesbenz  sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented crumple zone body design created to absorb impact in the event of a crash in  the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the mercedesbenz  the elegant luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an aheadofitstime air suspension system and a v engine that boasted  horsepower the decade also saw the launch of the mercedesbenz  sel  this fullsize sedan went from zero to  in under seven seconds distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day the s saw the birth of the brands storied sclass line of vehicles opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features the decade also saw mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles daimlerbenzs safety advancements continued in the s its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control the manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension the technology debuted on the compact mercedesbenz  e and it remains a vital component of the companys chassis engineering to this day mercedesbenz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the s thanks to the manufacturers partnership with amg a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultrahighperformance versions of some of its vehicles the first amg model offered in the us was the sporty c amg in  since then mercedes has gone on to offer an amgtuned version of almost all of its vehicles the companys current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history with a variety of sedans coupes suvs and roadsters filling mercedes showrooms it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck surely the fact that janis joplins song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brands premier status is still very much intact hide mercedesbenz history advertisement research models select vehicle make
