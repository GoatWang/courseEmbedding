north american based engineering firms to reinitiate research and development of the dcgt engine technology for applications directly related to turning a shaft for power generation however the company is not currently engaged in a research and development contract about the dcgt engine technology this patent in its simplicity makes it very unique a detonation cycle gas turbine engine includes a turbine rotor contained in a housing the exhaust ports of respective valveless combustion chambers are located on opposite sides of the rotor directing combustion gases toward the turbine the chambers are connected by a valveless manifold fed with fuel and oxidizer when combustible gases are detonated by an igniter in one of the combustion chambers the back pressure from the detonation shuts off the fuel and oxidizer flow to that chamber and redirects the fuel and oxidizer to the opposite chamber where detonation occurs the process repeats cyclically power is taken off the rotor shaft mechanically or electrically table of contents the invention utilizes a water wheel as the turbine wheel which has blades that are positively displaced through a blade race by the rapid expansion of gases exiting from combustion chambers via nozzles rather than pistons or gas turbines our engine has a blower rather than a compressor to supply less air per horsepower hour than required by existing gas turbines or piston engines thereby producing less exhaust gases per horsepower hour the blower supplies low pressure air via a single manifold to two combustion chambers simultaneously thereby requiring less work to complete a detonation cycle resulting in higher thermosmechanical efficiencies than gas turbines or piston engines the engine manifolds combustion chambers and ignition system has the capability of cyclically detonating fuelair mixtures without using valves the engine uses a fuel pump and vaporizers to gasify wet fuels prior to mixing with combustion air in the manifolds to produce complete combustion of all fuelair mixtures in the detonation process the engine uses a plasma arc ignition a visibly constant illuminating plasma flame between two electrodes to detonate fuelair mixtures and does not require critical ignition timing low pressure air and fuel mixtures are detonated instantaneouslyin less than one millisecondproducing high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress inert gases resulting in higher working pressures than the pressures produced in constant pressure heating utilized in gas turbine engines and otto and diesel cycle piston engines the detonation cycle engine uses less working fluid and produces less exhaust gas per horsepower hour than brayton cycle turbines and otto or diesel cycle piston engines six working prototypes have been developed and constructed over the course of the last  years culminating in the development of the th generation prototype engine which consists of two inch pound turbine wheels mounted on a single shaft driven by  horizontally opposed combustion chambers producing an estimated  horsepower at  rpm the dcgt engine technology includes an electromagnetic isothermal combustion eic process that powers the engine the eic process produces complete combustion of fueloxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations that negate unwanted nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions the high pressure gases produced by the detonations drive a unique turbine producing shaft horsepower the eic process enables the dcgt to operate with blower air at low static pressure negating the necessity of compressing and preheating fueloxidizer mixtures prior to combustion by eliminating the compression of fueloxidizer mixtures the dcgt engine achieves higher thermal efficiencies in a simplified mechanical structure the dcgt engine offers the following proprietary and competitive advantages over current diesel gasoline and gas turbine engines  air cooled  less

company history of the gas to liquid process technology in addition to the dcgt engine technology robert scragg is also the inventor of an expired patent for a process in which methane gas the primary component of natural gas is converted into liquid methanol at lowvolume production rates low volume is defined as  gallons per minute or less this process is referred to as gastoliquid gtl or the scragg process in  robert scragg received patent protection for his electromagnetic process and apparatus for making methanol while this patent has expired certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by tte mr scraggs  patent proved that gentle oxidation of methane gas a hydrocarbon using precise electromagnetic activation produces methanol gas which is then condensed in the reactor chamber to form liquid methanol the scragg process for gas to liquid conversion provides for production of methanol on a lowvolume scale using an easily transportable apparatus and system when the inventor received his patent for the gtl process technology he created a working gtl prototype for presentation to the us patent office today that prototype no longer exists and a new prototype has to be built using the inventors notes drawings and data collection along with newly gathered research information to prove the viability of the gtl technology as noted in section i above titled company history of the dcgt engine technology on november   the company closed an asset purchase agreement with robert and barbara scragg and alpha engines

into methanol liquid at lowvolume production rates on february   the company executed settlement agreements with both sahoma controlware llc and justin dean mutually concluding both the engineering services agreement dated june   with sahoma and the consulting services agreement dated june   with dean under both services agreements the company has received certain d modeling design and data sets that while not conclusive do provide a working baseline for continuing additional research and development to validate the gtl process technologies operational capacity and efficiency under the terms of the settlement agreements the company has no further obligation to pay sahoma the final milestone payment of  and dean will retain the  shares of the companys common stock issued to him under the consulting services agreement since executing the settlement agreements the company has had periodic discussions with a us based engineering entity as it considers the best path forward to continue research and development of its gtl lowvolume production process technology the next phase of research to validate the operational and commercial viability of the gtl process technology will require conducting additional modeling and the build of a bench prototype to collect data sets on a multitude of items including but not limited to yield rates species analysis and energy balance calculations to date the company is not engaged in a research and development contract why low volume production of gas to liquid throughout the united states and the world at sites where drilling operations are producing natural gas as a byproduct a large portion of the natural gas is being flare burned instead of being sold as the site is either too far from a pipeline or the accessible pipeline has no additional capacity when taking into account cost analysis environmental considerations and commodity pricing in todays marketplace tte believes the demand for an easily transportable selfsustaining apparatus capable of converting gas to liquid on a lowvolume scale has elevated as a result of the markets willingness to consider other options besides flare burning the onsite natural gas several companies are working to develop a lowvolume easily transportable gtl apparatus for commercialization to date tte is not aware of any company that has commercialized a lowvolume unmanned remote gtl system which has proved viable as a selfsupporting profitable business tte believes todays marketplace dynamics allow for a lower volume easily transportable gtl apparatus to address an enormous unmet need of redirecting flare burn natural gas for conversion to methanol for commercial resale or reuse onsite even at lowvolume production rates competition for the scragg process gas to liquid to date companies invested in converting natural gas to methanol are primarily engaged in highvolume scale production operations the current stateoftheart method of producing liquid methanol involves a low pressure process of preparing synthesis gas by steam reforming or partial oxidation of a gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock or by direct combination of carbon dioxide with purified hydrogen rich gases typically naphtha or a natural gas feedstock is desulfurized preheated and mixed with a superheated steam and then reacted over a conventional catalyst in a multitubular reformer after cooling the synthesis gas is compressed to the required pressure and passed into a hotwall converter over a low pressure methanol synthesis catalyst at a temperature ranging from  to  degrees centigrade the crude methanol that is formed is condensed and separated from the uncondensed gases which are recycled with makeup synthesis gas and fed back into the converter table of contents methanex corp is the worlds largest producer of methanol to date facilities converting gas to liquid are only focused on large scale production the dollar cost to build and operate a highvolume scale gtl production facility is significant patents for the gas to liquid scragg process to date there are no patents or patents pending for the gas to liquid scragg process on feb   the scragg process for converting methane to methanol was granted patent protection under us patent   the patent has expired however the company claims protection under trade secrets laws iii the hydrogen production burner systems in  tte was working with various chinese based partners to develop its licensed dcgt engine technology for use in various applications in asia at that time ttes ceo michael rouse was introduced to falcon power co ltd falcon a taiwan based business that was developing a technology focused on converting methanol to hydrogen ondemand using a proprietary technology now known as the hydrogen production burner system hpbs one of the potential fuel sources for the dcgt engine technology is hydrogen thus tte and falcon began a diligence phase to consider a collaborative effort to blend the  technologies having the hpbs produce hydrogen that could then provide a hydrogen fuel source for the dcgt engine commencing in the spring of  and through february  the company conducted diligence negotiated executed and ultimately terminated certain contractual obligations with certain taiwanese andor chinese based individuals and corporations the companys intentions throughout this defined period was to directly participate in commercializing the hydrogen production burner system worldwide through either licensing rights or a technology purchase agreement of the hpbs technology in september  the company was engaged in certain contracts with energy technology services co ltd ets a taiwan based corporation for business development of the hpbs technology in asia under the terms of these contracts the company provided ets a total of  can to fulfill ttes june  purchase order with ets for the manufacture of a new m hpbs unit throughout the fall of  and into january  ets provided tte with positive written and video status reports on the progress of the building completion and delivery of its m hpbs unit as defined and paid for under the june  purchase order to date ets has not fulfilled its contractual obligation to deliver a new m hpbs in february  tte hired a taiwan based law firm formosan brothers to represent the company in its pursuit of criminal fraud charges against ets principal partners chen chongping alan chen and huang renju mr huang both taiwan citizens for failure to deliver the newly built m hpbs unit as provided for under contract ets was represented to the company as the business partners for the inventor dr chingchang chang dr chang in spring  given that no direct evidence existed indicating dr chang had knowledge of the fraud against tte the company engaged in negotiations directly with the hpbs inventor for the purchase of the hpbs technology to date dr chang claims to have title ownership of the hpbs technology in october  dr chang presented tte with both pictures and video of a new m hpbs unit he completed building at his own expense while tte and dr chang have negotiated proposed terms and conditions for tte to acquire the hpbs technology tte is continuing to undergo extensive due diligence to validate and verify title ownership of the hpbs technology until the company is satisfied with both a title ownership of the hpbs and b exactly which taiwan individuals were engaged in fraud against the company any final agreement to purchase the hpbs technology is pending table of contents on december   tte received a written ruling from the taiwan district prosecutors office declining to prosecute alan chen and mr huang for criminal fraud on january   formosan brothers on behalf of tte filed an appeal to the taiwan high prosecution office requesting the high court review the facts and evidence of the case and grant tte an appeal of the lower courts decision and send the matter back to the taiwan district prosecutors office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence on february   tte received notice that the companies appeal was granted and that the initial decision dated december   by the taiwan district court prosecutor not to prosecute alan chen and mr huang was overturned and rescinded the case was returned to the taiwan district court prosecutor with instructions to conduct a new investigation of the facts and evidence tte and its counsel intend to continue to pursue these charges until a satisfactory resolution is obtained as of september   tte and its taiwan based legal counsel formosan brothers law firm continue to submit briefings attend hearings and respond to any request from the taiwan district court prosecutor as the prosecutors office undertakes its new investigation about the hydrogen production and burner system hydrogen h is an ideal fuel for combustion  it burns easily and efficiently at very high temperatures and emits pure water vapor ho as its only byproduct but the gas is a difficult fuel to work with existing methods for transporting and storing hydrogen namely highpressure compression and liquefaction are complex inefficient and expensive its also the smallest molecule in existence and tends naturally to leak only exacerbating these problems the hydrogen production burner system is an efficient methanoltohydrogen production and burner integrated technology which utilizes a steam reformation process employs a proprietary chemical catalyst and a unique low temperature pyrolytic reaction to convert common methanol into cleanburning hydrogen gas ondemand for use as a fuel source to a proprietary burner assembly the inventor of the hpbs is located in taiwan and has been developing the technology for over  years having a technology available that can produce hydrogen ondemand and onsite eliminates the costly and difficult issues that surround the transportation and storage of hydrogen additionally methanol cho also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol is inexpensive widely accessible and easier to store handle and transport the hpbs technology provides a unique and marketable solution for those entities wanting to burn hydrogen as a thermal heat source the hpbs system offers the potential to integrate with a wide array of industrial boilers and steam generators as well as other various residential and commercial applications the efficiency of the hpbs technology could save the    oct   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage watch out ‘kids’ are

technology dcgt for the application of heavyduty highway trucks has been at the core of the companys business operations   the dcgt was patented in december  by the inventor robert scragg mr scragg whom had earlier issued a master license for all rights and potential applications for the dcgt to alpha engines inc alpha a company owned by he and his wife barbara scragg on december   tte acquired the option rights for an exclusive license from alpha for manufacturing and marketing heavyduty highway truck engines utilizing alphas dcgt engine technology embodied in us patent no  and other proprietary technology and rights owned by alpha at that time including marketing survey data in the highway trucking industry tte exercised its option and acquired the licensing rights on july     the company has funded the building and testing of prototype  a hp cylinder engine and prototype  a hp cylinder engine for the purpose of sufficiently advancing the research and development of the dcgt engine technology to a point of entering into a joint venture agreement with a heavyduty truck engine manufacturer for advanced research and development   in august  the company changed a majority of its board of directors management and corporate officer personnel and undertook a revised look at the companys business operations while ttes new management and board of directors in coordination with mr scragg continue to believe the patented dcgt technology can be developed for commercialization the new tte board of directors determined that the company should shift its research

the final milestone payment of  and dean will retain his  rule  common shares issued to him under the consulting services agreement   since executing the settlement agreements the company is in ongoing discussions with a us based engineering entity as it considers the best path forward to continue research and development of its gtl lowvolume production process technology the next phase of research to validate the operational and commercial viability of the gtl process technology will require conducting additional modeling and the build of a bench prototype to collect data sets on a multitude of items including but not limited to yield rates species analysis and energy balance calculations      table of contents   why low volume production of gas to liquid   throughout the united states and the world at sites where drilling operations are producing natural gas as a byproduct a large portion of the natural gas is being flare burned instead of being sold as the site is either too far from a pipeline or the accessible pipeline has no additional capacity when taking into account cost analysis environmental considerations and commodity pricing in todays marketplace tte believes the demand for an easily transportable selfsustaining apparatus capable of converting gas to liquid on a lowvolume scale has elevated   as a result of the markets willingness to consider other options besides flare burning the onsite natural gas several companies are working to develop a lowvolume easily transportable gtl apparatus for commercialization to date tte is not aware of any company that has commercialized a lowvolume unmanned remote gtl system which has proved viable as a selfsupporting profitable business   tte believes todays marketplace dynamics allow for a lower volume easily transportable gtl apparatus to address an enormous unmet need of redirecting flare burn natural gas for conversion to methanol for commercial resale or reuse onsite even at lowvolume production rates   competition for the scragg process gas to liquid   to date companies invested in converting natural gas to methanol are primarily engaged in highvolume scale production operations the current stateoftheart method of producing liquid methanol involves a low pressure process of preparing synthesis gas by steam reforming or partial oxidation of a gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock or by direct combination of carbon dioxide with purified hydrogen rich gases typically naphtha or a natural gas feedstock is desulfurized preheated and mixed with a superheated steam and then reacted over a conventional catalyst in a multitubular reformer after cooling the synthesis gas is compressed to the required pressure and passed into a hotwall converter over a low pressure methanol synthesis catalyst at a temperature ranging from  to  degrees centigrade the crude methanol that is formed is condensed and separated from the uncondensed gases which are recycled with makeup synthesis gas and fed back into the converter   methanex corp is the worlds largest producer of methanol to date facilities converting gas to liquid are only focused on large scale production the dollar cost to build and operate a highvolume scale gtl production facility is significant   patents for the gas to liquid scragg process   to date there are no patents or patents pending for the gas to liquid scragg process on feb   the scragg process for converting methane to methanol was granted patent protection under us patent   the patent has expired however the process remains protected under trade secrets law   iii the hydrogen production burner system technology   company history of the hydrogen production burner system   in  tte was working with various chinese based partners to develop its licensed dcgt engine technology for use in various applications in asia at that time ttes ceo was introduced to falcon power co ltd falcon a taiwan based business that was developing a technology focused on converting methanol to hydrogen ondemand using a proprietary technology now known as the hydrogen production burner system hpbs one of the potential fuel sources for the dcgt engine technology is hydrogen thus tte and falcon began a diligence phase to consider a collaborative effort to blend the  technologies having the hpbs produce hydrogen that could then provide a hydrogen fuel source for the dcgt engine      table of contents   commencing in the spring of  and through february  the company conducted diligence negotiated executed and ultimately terminated certain contractual obligations with certain taiwanese andor chinese based individuals and corporations the companys intentions throughout this defined period was to directly participate in commercializing the hydrogen production burner system worldwide through either licensing rights or a technology purchase agreement of the hpbs technology   in september  the company was engaged in certain contracts with energy technology services co ltd ets a taiwan based corporation for business development of the hpbs technology in asia under the terms of these contracts the company provided ets a total of  can to fulfill ttes june  purchase order with ets for the manufacture of a new m hpbs unit   throughout the fall of  and into january  ets provided tte with positive written and video status reports on the progress of the building completion and delivery of its m hpbs unit as defined and paid for under the june  purchase order to date ets has not fulfilled its contractual obligation to deliver a new m hpbs   in february  tte hired a taiwan based law firm formosan brothers to represent the company in its pursuit of criminal fraud charges against ets principal partners chen chongping alan chen and huang renju mr huang both taiwan citizens for failure to deliver the newly built m hpbs unit as provided for under contract ets was represented to the company as the business partners for the inventor dr chingchang chang dr chang   in spring  given that no direct evidence existed indicating dr chang had knowledge of the fraud against tte the company engaged in negotiations directly with the hpbs inventor for the purchase of the hpbs technology to date dr chang claims to have title ownership of the hpbs technology until the company is satisfied with both a title ownership of the hpbs and b exactly which taiwan individuals were engaged in fraud against the company any final agreement to purchase the hpbs technology is pending   on december   tte received a written ruling from the taiwan district prosecutors office declining to prosecute alan chen and mr huang for criminal fraud   on january   formosan brothers on behalf of tte filed an appeal to the taiwan high prosecution office requesting the high court review the facts and evidence of the case and grant tte an appeal of the lower courts decision and send the matter back to the taiwan district prosecutors office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence   on february   tte received notice that the companies appeal was granted and that the initial decision dated december   by the taiwan district court prosecutor not to prosecute alan chen and mr huang was overturned and rescinded the case was returned to the taiwan district court prosecutor with instructions to conduct a new investigation of the facts and evidence tte and its counsel intend to continue to pursue these charges until a final resolution is obtained   as of december   tte and its taiwan based legal counsel formosan brothers law firm continue to submit briefings attend hearings and respond to any request from the taiwan district court prosecutor as the prosecutors office undertakes its new investigation   about the hydrogen production burner system technology   hydrogen h is an ideal fuel for combustion — it burns easily and efficiently at very high temperatures and emits pure water vapor ho as its only byproduct but the gas is a difficult fuel to work with existing methods for transporting and storing hydrogen namely highpressure compression and liquefaction are complex inefficient and expensive its also the smallest molecule in existence and tends naturally to leak only exacerbating these problems   the hydrogen production burner system is an efficient methanoltohydrogen production and burner integrated technology which utilizes a steam reformation process employs a proprietary chemical catalyst and a unique low temperature pyrolytic reaction to convert common methanol into cleanburning hydrogen gas ondemand for use as a fuel source to a proprietary burner assembly the inventor of the hpbs is located in taiwan and has been developing the technology for over  years      table of contents   having a technology available that can produce hydrogen ondemand and onsite eliminates the costly and difficult issues that surround the transportation and storage of hydrogen additionally methanol cho also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol is inexpensive widely accessible and easier to store handle and transport the hpbs technology provides a unique and marketable solution for those entities wanting to burn hydrogen as a thermal heat source   the hpbs system is applicable to a wide array of industrial boilers and steam generators as well as other various residential and commercial applications the efficiency of the hpbs technology could save the end user  on energy costs as compared to current sources of energy such as electricity heavy oils coal and natural gas   competition for the hpbs technology   the company has identified a handful of competitors including airgas that manufacture hydrogen producing generators there are three main types of hydrogen generators those that a convert methane to hydrogen through a catalyst b convert water through electrolysis and c convert methanol through catalysis there are commercialized units for each method however to our knowledge there are no commercialized units like the hpbs technology that produce hydrogen from methanol on demand for onsite use in that regard the company considers itself uniquely positioned to provide the market with a hydrogen production and burner system that is uniquely different than its competitors   patents for the hpbs technology   to date the company has no patents nor does tte know of any patents pending for the hpbs technology the catalytic process used to covert methanol to hydrogen is proprietary and to the best of the companies knowledge stands alone in marketplace if tte is able to secure ownership of the hpbs technology tte intends to continue to develop the technology with an eye toward submitting patents for those items that are able to be patented   employees   we presently have no employees staffing levels and employee compensation will be determined by ttes board of directors   item a risk factors   not applicable   item b

criminal complaint with the taipei taiwan district prosecutors office the prosecutor seeking criminal charges against the principal partners of ets mr chen chongping alan chen and huang renju mr huang for fraud in connection with their actions related to the companys business initiative to commercialize the hpbs technology in asia   on december   tte received a written ruling from the taiwan district prosecutors office that it had declined to prosecute alan chen and mr huang for criminal fraud   on january   formosan brothers on behalf of tte filed an appeal to the taiwan high prosecution office requesting the high court review the facts and evidence of the case and send the matter back to the taiwan district prosecutors office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence   on

gas cycle turbine dcgt tte owns an exclusive global license for the manufacturing and marketing of a highly innovative low emissions turbinebased truck engine known as the detonation cycle gas turbine dcgt engine its patented cyclic detonation technology when completed could revolutionize the heavyduty truck engine market the dcgt engine has no pistons or valves and uses no lube oil filters or pumps uses over  less fuel than current engine technologies significantly reduces nitrogen oxide no no no and carbon monoxide co emissions operates on all fuels hydrocarbon hydrogen and synthetic has flexfuel and mixed fuels capability has few moving parts requiring less maintenance has a high powertoweight ratio is lightweight less than  lbs per hp is air cooled has cold start capability the dcgt engine is powered by an innovative new electromagnetic isothermal combustion process that produces complete combustion of fueloxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations the highpressure gasses produced by these detonations drive a unique turbine producing shaft horsepower the engine’s unique combustion process allows the dcgt to operate with blower air at low static pressure negating the necessity of compressing and preheating fueloxidizer mixtures prior to combustion once the compression of fueloxidizer mixtures has been eliminated the engine both achieves higher thermal efficiency in a simplified mechanical structure and provides significant advantages over current diesel gasoline and gas turbine engines ▶ learn more about our detonation cycle gas turbine engine technology ▶ view
