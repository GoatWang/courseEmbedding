from snowy new york where this morning’s layer of fresh white snow will soon turn into black bottomless slush puddles of deathclapping back term sheet readers had lots of thoughts on michael moritz’s oped on stephen schwarzman carried interest president trump and private equity ethics here i’ll share them in a feedback column later but one repeated theme was that the companies backed by moritz’s firm sequoia capital and other vc firms contribute to just as much indirect job loss via displacement as buyouts do directly via layoffsthe american investment council’s official response accuses moritz of misunderstanding the private equity model “long term investments” “alignment of interests” noting that pension funds benefit from private equity’s high returns and that many startups raise debt as wellon carried interest the council alongside the national taxpayers union and americans for tax reform argues that “changing the tax treatment of carried interest would hurt the pension funds charities and college endowments that form partnerships with fund managers and depend on the superior returns these managers deliver”impaired last fall term sheet mentioned simple the innovative digital bank that bbva acquired in  for  million as an example of a traditional bank using a startup within it to disrupt itself it’s the same model being used at almond bank the secretive “bank within a bank” that andreessen horowitz battery ventures and ribbit capital were incubating in cross river bank a joint investmentat the time i noted that simple had experienced outage issues over the years i also mentioned that almond would pick up where simple left off but simple representatives were quick to let me know at the time that the company is still very much alive simple has even begun onboarding simple customers to the bbva balance sheet a source close to the company saysbut this month bbva compass the north american subsidiary that owns simple took a  million impairment charge on the company according to an sec filing josh reich simple’s founder and ceo told term sheet that bbva continues to invest in simple the team now has 0 employees and “added customers at the rate of a bank that has over  branches” he saysbbva compass representative christina anderson provided more detail via emailaccounting rules for investments like these and valuations for fintech companies are very volatile and often result in impairments  we are also interested in the intangibles that our innovation investments bring including their knowledge and culture as those elements help bbva compass become more dynamic customercentric and could potentially change the way banking is done as with most investments return is delivered in the medium to long term and bbva compass remains committed to simple and its continued success and ongoing growth  further impaired publicis groupe a major acquirer of digital advertising businesses and agencies has taken a massive writedown on its onetime

turn the ad holding company into more of a consulting business was “probably too ambitious”leap of faith i read this business insider article on magic leap with great interest in recent months the highly funded  billion highly valuable  billion highly secretive company has been accused of overhyping its notyetlaunched technology now according to the article the company is “scrambling” to get a demo ready ahead of a big board meeting to be clear all startups scramble but magic leap is under more pressure than most startups thanks to its valuation and fundingthe story shows that magic leap is making progress its demo is in “decent” shape but it also shows the danger of too much hype before launching anything its ceo has promised the product will be like “really cool dream of flying squirrels and sea monkeys and rainbow powered unicorns of most anything you can imagine” that’s a lot to live up to also beyoncé was apparently unimpressed by a personalized demobroadly speaking one side effect of the theranos mess is that companies are terrified of being called “the next theranos” they’re simultaneously scared of the media and want more than ever to participate in and shape
