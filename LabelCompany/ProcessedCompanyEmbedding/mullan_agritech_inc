our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in our business environment we base our estimates on experience the use of independent thirdparty specialists and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments estimates and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we believe the following are our critical accounting policies basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap going concern as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we had net accumulated deficit of  and  as of december   and december   our cash balances as of december   and december   were  and  respectively we had shortterm payable of  million at december   which would due in the next  months in addition we had a working capital deficit of  and  at december   and december   respectively these matters raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the companys ability to further implement its business plan raise additional capital and generate more revenues the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of mullan agritech muliang hk shanghai mufeng muliang industry zongbao fukang agritech development zongbao cangzhou ningling fertilizer muliang sales zhonglian and yunnan muliang all intercompany transactions and account balances are eliminated in consolidation use of estimates in preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates required by management include the recoverability of longlived assets and the valuation of inventories actual results could differ from those estimates accounts receivable we state accounts receivable at cost net of allowance for doubtful accounts based on our past experience and current practice in the prc management provides for an  allowance for doubtful accounts equivalent to those accounts that are not collected within one year plus  for receivables outstanding for six months old it is managements belief that the current bad debt allowance adequately reflects an appropriate estimate based on managements judgment inventory valuation we value our fertilizer inventories at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis and net realizable value the estimated market price substantially all inventory expenses packaging and supplies are valued by the weighted average method apple orchard apple orchard consists primarily of rental for an apple farm labor cost fertilizers apple seeds apple seedlings and others the costs to purchase and cultivate apple trees and the expenditures related to labor and materials to plant apple trees until they become commercially productive are capitalized which require a year period the estimated production life for apple tree is  years and the costs are amortized without a residual value expenses incurred maintaining apple trees during the growth cycle until seedling apple trees or grafted varieties are fruited are capitalized into inventory and included in work in processapple orchard a component of inventories amortized expenses pertaining to apple orchard are included in inventory costs for those apples to be sold and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold similar to other assets the failure of our apple orchard to be serviceable over the entirety of their anticipated useful lives or to be sold at their anticipated residual value will negatively impact our operating results revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with securities exchange commission sec staff

operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we evaluate on an ongoing basis our estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in our business environment we base our estimates on experience the use of independent thirdparty specialists and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments estimates and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we believe the following are our critical accounting policies basis of presentation our consolidated

management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates required by management include the recoverability of longlived assets and the valuation of inventories actual results could differ from those estimates accounts receivable we state accounts receivable at cost net of allowance for doubtful accounts based on our past experience and current practice in the prc management provides for an  allowance for doubtful accounts equivalent to those accounts that are not collected within one year plus  for receivables outstanding for six months old it is managements belief that the current bad debt allowance adequately reflects an appropriate estimate based on managements judgment inventory valuation we value our fertilizer inventories at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis and net realizable value the estimated market price substantially all inventory expenses packaging and supplies are valued by the weighted average method apple orchard apple orchard consists primarily of rental for an apple farm labor cost fertilizers apple seeds apple seedlings and others the costs to purchase and cultivate apple trees and the expenditures related to labor and materials to plant apple trees until they become commercially productive are capitalized which require a year period the estimated production life for apple tree is  years and the costs are amortized without a residual value expenses incurred maintaining apple trees during the growth cycle until seedling apple trees or grafted varieties are fruited are capitalized into inventory and included in work in processapple orchard a component of inventories amortized expenses pertaining to apple orchard are included in inventory costs for those apples to be sold and ultimately become a component of cost of goods sold similar to other assets the failure of our apple orchard to be serviceable over the entirety of their anticipated useful lives or to be sold at

financial statements in accordance with us gaap  the company’s functional currency is united states dollars “usd” all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated the financial statements include all adjustments that in the opinion of management are necessary to make the financial statements not misleading   interim financial statements   the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of september   and for nine months ended september   and  are unaudited in the opinion of management all necessary adjustments which include only normal recurring adjustments have been made to present fairly the financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been condensed or omitted however the company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the years ended december   and  financial statements the results of operations for the nine month period ended september   and  are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the full year ended december   or that have been achieved in the year ended december          use of estimates   in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period actual results could differ from those estimates   foreign currency translation   the company’s wholly owned subsidiary advanced environment is incorporated in hong kong the financial position and results of operations of the subsidiary are determined using the local currency “hong kong dollar” or “hkd” as the functional currency   translation from hkd into united states dollars “usd” or “” for reporting purposes is performed by translating the results of operations denominated in foreign currency at the weighted average rates of exchange during the reporting periods assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet dates are translated at the market rate of exchange in effect at that date the registered equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution all translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements into usd are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity

comprehensive income   cash   the company considers all highly liquid temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents at september   and december   the company had cash of  respectively   basic and diluted loss per share   the company reports loss per share in accordance with fasb asc  “earnings per share” the company’s basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the periods presented diluted earnings per share are computed based on the assumption that any dilutive options or warrants were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method  under this method the company’s outstanding stock warrants are assumed to be exercised and funds thus obtained were assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period for the nine months ended september   and  no dilutive instruments outstanding however if present a separate computation of diluted loss per share would not have been presented as these common stock equivalents would have been antidilutive due to the companys net loss   fair value of financial instruments   effective january   the company adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosure “asc ” for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis asc  establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements the adoption of asc  did not have an impact on the company’s financial position or operating results but did expand certain disclosures   asc  defines fair value as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date additionally asc  requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs these inputs are prioritized below   level  observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  observable marketbased inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data level  unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions        the company did not identify any assets and liabilities that are required to be presented on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with the relevant accounting standards   the carrying values of accounts payables and debts approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments   related party   parties are considered to be related to the company if the parties directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries control are controlled by or are under common control with the company related parties also include principal owners of the company its management members of the immediate families of principal owners of the company and its management and other parties with which the company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests the company discloses all related party transactions all transactions shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to the related party   note  – loan from related party   as of september   and december   the company had a loan payable of  and  to mr lirong wang sole shareholder of the company this loan does not have interest burden and is due on demand   note  – stockholders’ deficiency   stock issued for services   on january   the company issued  shares of common stock to its founders having a fair value of  share for capital contribution   on august   mr hayden zou the company’s prior sole shareholder sold all of his shares of the company to mr lirong wang for a total of  concurrent with the change in control mr haiping ma resigned from the position of president of the company and mr hayden zou resigned from the position of a direction of the company mr lirong wang was appointed as a director and president of the company   note  – going concern   as reflected in the accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements the company is in the development stage with limited operations the company has a net loss of  from inception and a working capital deficit and stockholders’ deficiency of  at september   and used  cash in operations from inception this raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company’s ability to raise additional capital and implement its business plan the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern management intends to provide the company with additional loans as needed and is seeking a merger target to implement its strategic plans management feels these actions provide the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern        item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion of our financial condition and results of the operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report and in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december     this discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management   overview   the company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a reporting corporation a private company by merging with us will become a reporting company as soon as the merger is consummated in contrast a private company by filing its own registration statement on form  will not typically become reporting until  days after the filing of the registration statement on form  in our experience private companies who are interested in becoming a public company often perceive a vehicle that allows them to become public without waiting time valuable to them our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location and thus may acquire any type of business       the company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to     i filing exchange act reports and         ii investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   we believe that we will be able to meet these costs through funds as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by mr lirong wang our sole stockholder and management pursuant to a verbal agreement with mr lirong wang in august  he will fund the company’s operations including but not limited to the investigating and analyzing business combinations and the filing of the exchange act reports until such time as we undertake a change of control or a reverse merger whereby mr wang will no longer be the controlling shareholder of the company at this time we do not have the funds to pay for these filings and do not have any written agreement to raise funds to cover these expenses   as of the date of the period covered by this report the company has nominal assets there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed currently however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available   the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another        the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky through information obtained from industry publications and professionals our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex we do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses     corporate actions   on august   we change our corporate from name china thermatech inc to mullan agritech inc     on august   we amended and restated our memorandum of association and articles of association to among others change our capital shares by increasing the authorized number of common shares from  to  with the same par value  per share and creating a class of  preferred shares par value  per share     results of operations   three months ended september   compared to three months ended september     the company has not conducted any active operations since inception except for its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates no revenue has been generated by the company from january   inception to september   it is unlikely the company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company of which there can be no assurance it is managements assertion that these circumstances may hinder the companys ability to continue as a going concern the company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates   for the three months ended september   our operating expenses consisted solely of general and administrative expenses of  resulting in a net loss of  in comparison for the three months ended september   our operating expenses consisted solely of general and administrative expenses of  resulting in a net loss of  our general and administrative expenses are mainly comprised of legal accounting and other professional service fees incurred in connection the preparation and filing of

months ended september   net cash used in operating activities totaled  for the period from january   inception to september     net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the period from

loss of  from inception and a working capital deficit and stockholders’ deficiency of  at september   and used  cash in operations from inception this raises substantial doubt about its ability to

statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern        management intends to provide the company with additional loans as
