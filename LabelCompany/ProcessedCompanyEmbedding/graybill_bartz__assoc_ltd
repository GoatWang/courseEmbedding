is similar to that of our larger balanced portfolios    graybill bartz  associates ltd  s cottage hill    elmhurst il     phone     fax     email infograybillbartzcom graybill bartz  associates  investment philosophy  fixed income philosophy   fixed income philosophy overview it is our belief that the fixed income portion of a well diversified portfolio provides a stable anchor to the overall plan over the long term the equity portion rewards investors with greater return while bonds provide important diversification and stability it follows from this belief that the fixed income portion should not be the riskier portion for this reason we mainly focus on investment grade bonds when we believe the risk reward profile is favorable however we will opportunistically purchase highyield securities or exchangetradedfunds etf’s that participate in the high yield securities market corporate bond strategy we look to the areas of the bond market which provide incremental income – this leads us to corporate bonds our main emphasis for fixed income we have many years of experience in analyzing companies that issue corporate bonds portfolio construction in developing bond portfolios we favor spreading out maturities over a number of years to reduce the reinvestment risk our typical purchase is an intermediate bond with a maturity of  to  years the major issuers in this maturity range tend to be financial institutions we have extensive experience in analyzing financial entities so our client’s bond portfolios will typically have representation in this sector we diversify across industrial companies as well and include utilities when available for high tax bracket clients in taxable accounts we also utilize tax exempt bonds – we make these determinations based on the tax equivalent yield and relative credit quality for larger portfolios we favor investing in individual bonds instead of bond funds the yield to maturity is known at the time of purchase and as long as the bond is held to maturity the investor knows the return for bond funds however there is no maturity and the net asset value of the fund can change daily institutional network since bonds unlike stocks are not traded on an exchange it is important to have multiple dealer relationships over the course of many years of experience investing in bonds we have built up relationships with quite a few individuals and brokerdealers we have the advantage of dealing with many different firms in the bond business some have municipal bond expertise some specialize in corporate bonds a few of them offer economic or credit research some specialize in transacting in small quantities the advantage is that we are not confined to dealing with one or two firms when transacting bonds    graybill bartz
