shareholders for the reservation engine the consideration paid for the license was  million shares of our common stock we utilized an historical stock price analysis to determine that  was a fair price for the shares issued to the licensor in this transaction we reviewed the illiquidity of our shares trading in the pink sheets and the daily closing market price and trading volume of the shares for the sixty day period prior to the transaction during this time the pricing ranged  to  per share we concluded that the trading of our stock in the pink sheets may not reflect the fair price of the

and market both physical and virtual tradeshow space through the companys website   the company has never commenced significant operations and therefore is classified as a development stage enterprise   the financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a retroactive basis based upon on subsequent information available as of september   the company has been dormant since october

significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the receiver has prepared this report for the company and the financial statements included within this report are for the purposes of complying with a deficiency notice from finra regarding a proposed corporate action for the issuer the receiver believes the request by finra to prepare documents such as these that date beyond the

recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab a and b and as revised by sab  revenue recognition accordingly we recognize revenue when  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected   the company generates revenues from commissions earned on net sales from its internetbased reservations internet revenues consist primarily of commissions which are recorded at net in accordance with eitf  this revenue is recognized when customers present records of the room reservations made on the companys internet based software the company also has to take into consideration eitf in which the companys revenues get reduced by the consideration it has paid to its vendor as the consideration paid to the vendor exceeds the benefit received     f table of contents   sales returns allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts   significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period management must make estimates of potential future order disputes related to current period product revenue allowances for estimated product returns are provided at the time of sale we evaluate the adequacy of allowances for returns primarily based upon our evaluation of historical and expected sales experience and by channel of distribution the judgments and estimates of management may have a material effect on the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period   similarly management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required   fair value of financial instruments   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments when it is practicable to estimate that value the carrying amounts of the companys financial instruments as of april   approximate their respective fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments such instruments consist of cash accounts payable and accrued expenses the fair value of related party payables is not determinable   equipment   equipment is carried at cost depreciation is computed using a declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable property which range from  to  years management evaluates useful lives regularly in order to determine recoverability taking into consideration current technological conditions maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred additions and betterments are capitalized upon retirement or disposal of any item of equipment the cost is and related accumulated depreciation of the disposed assets is removed and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to operations   longlived assets   the company records impairments to its longlived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of the assets carrying value unlikely in that case if the sum of the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value   income taxes   the company utilizes sfas no  accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized     f table of contents   issuance of stock for services   sfas no  accounting for stockbased compensation  encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stockbased employee compensation plans at fair value the company has elected to continue to account for employee stockbased compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations as permitted by sfas no  accordingly compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess if any of the quoted market price of the companys stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock for stock options issued to nonemployees the issuance of stock options is accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for stock options granted to nonemployees in the period in which the consideration is obtained from the nonemployee   compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for issuances of common shares to employees and nonemployees that have rendered services to the company compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the common stock whichever is more readily determinable   segment information   sfas no  segment information  amends the requirements for companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments operating segments as defined in sfas no  are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by a company in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services geographic areas and major customers the company evaluated sfas no  and determined that the company intends to operate two operating segments trade show and entertainment   basic and diluted net loss per share   net loss per share is calculated in accordance with sfas no  earnings per share for the period presented basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilative convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later and as if funds obtained thereby we used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   the company has potentially dilutive securities in the form of outstanding stock options issued to three members of the board of directors there are no other potentially dilutive securities outstanding   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates   significant estimates made by management are among others realizability of longlived

the illiquidity of our shares trading in the pink sheets and the daily closing market price and trading volume of the shares for the sixty day period prior to the transaction during this time the pricing ranged  to  per share we concluded that the trading of our stock in the pink sheets may not reflect the fair price of the stock because of the thin trading market wide bidask spread and large

intellectual property rights to a database and business plan and significantly changed its business plan to develop tradeshow software and market both physical and virtual tradeshow space through the companys website   the company has never commenced significant operations and therefore is classified as a development stage enterprise   the financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a retroactive basis based upon on subsequent information available as of september   the company has been dormant since october  and as of may   is under the control of a receiver in nevada’s eighth judicial district in ap as a result all asset accounts have been written down to zero for accounting purposes    summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the receiver has prepared this report for the company and the financial statements included within this report are for the purposes of complying with a deficiency notice from finra regarding a proposed corporate action for the issuer the receiver believes the request by finra to prepare documents such as these that date beyond the statute of limitations for any public or private cause of action   since the company is currently in receivership and has no verifiable assets all assets have been written down to zero   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab a and b and as revised by sab  revenue recognition accordingly we recognize revenue when  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected   the company generates revenues from commissions earned on net sales from its internetbased reservations internet revenues consist primarily of commissions which are recorded at net in accordance with eitf  this revenue is recognized when customers present records of the room reservations made on the companys internet based software the company also has to take into consideration eitf in which the companys revenues get reduced by the consideration it has paid to its vendor as the consideration paid to the vendor exceeds the benefit received   sales returns allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts   significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period management must make estimates of potential future order disputes related to current period product revenue allowances for estimated product returns are provided at the time of sale we evaluate the adequacy of allowances for returns primarily based upon our evaluation of historical and expected sales experience and by channel of distribution the judgments and estimates of management may have a material effect on the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period     f table of contents    similarly management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required   fair value of financial instruments   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no   disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments when it is practicable to estimate that value the carrying amounts of the companys financial instruments as of april   approximate their respective fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments such instruments consist of cash accounts payable and accrued expenses the fair value of related party payables is not determinable   equipment   equipment is carried at cost depreciation is computed using a declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable property which range from  to  years management evaluates useful lives regularly in order to determine recoverability taking into consideration current technological conditions maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred additions and betterments are capitalized upon retirement or disposal of any item of equipment the cost is and related accumulated depreciation of the disposed assets is removed and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to operations   longlived assets   the company records impairments to its longlived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of the assets carrying value unlikely in that case if the sum of the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value   income taxes   the company utilizes sfas no   accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   going concern   the company has experienced net losses to date we will need additional working capital to service debt and for ongoing operations which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern management of the company has developed a strategy to meet operational shortfalls which may include equity funding short term or long term financing or debt financing to enable the company to reach profitable operations however it is not guaranteed that the plan will succeed nor that the company will be able to execute its plans the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of assetcarrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern     f table of contents    issuance of stock for services   sfas no   accounting for stockbased compensation  encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stockbased employee compensation plans at fair value the company has elected to continue to account for employee stockbased compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no   accounting for stock issued to employees   and related interpretations as permitted by sfas no  accordingly compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess if any of the quoted market price of the companys stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock for stock options issued to nonemployees the issuance of stock options is accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for stock options granted to nonemployees in the period in which the consideration is obtained from the nonemployee   compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for issuances of common shares to employees and nonemployees that have rendered services to the company compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the common stock whichever is more readily determinable   segment information   sfas no   segment information  amends the requirements for companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments operating segments as defined in sfas no  are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by a company in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services geographic areas and major customers the company evaluated sfas no  and determined that the company intends to operate two operating segments trade show and entertainment   basic and diluted net loss per share   net loss per share is calculated in accordance with sfas no   earnings per share  for the period presented basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilative convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later and as if funds obtained thereby we used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   the company has potentially dilutive securities in the form of outstanding stock options issued to three members of the board of directors there are no other potentially dilutive securities outstanding   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates   significant estimates made by management are among others realizability of longlived assets deferred taxes

inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk   management assessed

interest paid                      the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements      table of contents   businessvn inc a development stage company notes to financial statements july      organization   businessvn inc the company was originally formed on september   as interactive processing inc a nevada corporation to market hightech consumer electronics through television homeshopping networks retail stores catalog companies and their website remotecontrolscom in march  the company changed its name to worldtradeshowcom inc during the same month the company acquired intellectual property rights to a database and business plan and significantly changed its business plan to develop tradeshow software and market both physical and virtual tradeshow space through the companys website   the company has never commenced significant operations and therefore is classified as a development stage enterprise   the financial statements included in this report have been prepared on a retroactive basis based upon on subsequent information available as of september   the company has been dormant since october  and as of may   is under the control of a receiver in nevada’s eighth judicial district in ap as a result all asset accounts have been written down to zero for accounting purposes    summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the receiver has prepared this report for the company and the financial statements included within this report are for the purposes of complying with a deficiency notice from finra regarding a proposed corporate action for the issuer the receiver believes the request by finra to prepare documents such as these that date beyond the statute of limitations for any public or private cause of action since the company is currently in receivership and has no verifiable assets all assets have been written down to zero   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab a and b and as revised by sab  revenue recognition accordingly we recognize revenue when  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectibility is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected   the company generates revenues from commissions earned on net sales from its internetbased reservations internet revenues consist primarily of commissions which are recorded at net in accordance with eitf  this revenue is recognized when customers present records of the room reservations made on the companys internet based software the company also has to take into consideration eitf in which the companys revenues get reduced by the consideration it has paid to its vendor as the consideration paid to the vendor exceeds the benefit received      table of contents   sales returns allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts   significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period management must make estimates of potential future order disputes related to current period product revenue allowances for estimated product returns are provided at the time of sale we evaluate the adequacy of allowances for returns primarily based upon our evaluation of historical and expected sales experience and by channel of distribution the judgments and estimates of management may have a material effect on the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period   similarly management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts customer concentrations customer creditworthiness current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required   fair value of financial instruments   statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments when it is practicable to estimate that value the carrying amounts of the companys financial instruments as of july   approximate their respective fair values because of the shortterm nature of these instruments such instruments consist of cash accounts payable and accrued expenses the fair value of related party payables is not determinable   equipment   equipment is carried at cost depreciation is computed using a declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable property which range from  to  years management evaluates useful lives regularly in order to determine recoverability taking into consideration current technological conditions maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred additions and betterments are capitalized upon retirement or disposal of any item of equipment the cost is and related accumulated depreciation of the disposed assets is removed and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to operations   longlived assets   the company records impairments to its longlived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of the assets carrying value unlikely in that case if the sum of the expected future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value   income taxes   the company utilizes sfas no  accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized      table of contents   issuance of stock for services   sfas no  accounting for stockbased compensation  encourages but does not require companies to record compensation cost for stockbased employee compensation plans at fair value the company has elected to continue to account for employee stockbased compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations as permitted by sfas no  accordingly compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess if any of the quoted market price of the companys stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock for stock options issued to nonemployees the issuance of stock options is accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for stock options granted to nonemployees in the period in which the consideration is obtained from the nonemployee   compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements for issuances of common shares to employees and nonemployees that have rendered services to the company compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the common stock whichever is more readily determinable   segment information   sfas no  segment information  amends the requirements for companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments operating segments as defined in sfas no  are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by a company in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance it also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services geographic areas and major customers the company evaluated sfas no  and determined that the company intends to operate two operating segments trade show and entertainment   basic and diluted net loss per share   net loss per share is calculated in accordance with sfas no  earnings per share for the period presented basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilative convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later and as if funds obtained thereby we used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   the company has potentially dilutive securities in the form of outstanding stock options issued to three members of the board of directors there are no other potentially dilutive securities outstanding   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented actual results could differ from those estimates   significant estimates made by management are among others realizability of longlived assets deferred taxes and stock option valuation management reviews its estimates on a quarterly basis and where necessary makes adjustments prospectively      table of contents    provision for income taxes   as of april   the company has a federal net operating loss carry forwards of  that can be utilized to reduce future taxable income the net operating loss carry forward will expire through  if not utilized utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carry forward may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended and similar state provisions the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards before utilization the company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset because of uncertainty regarding realizability    related party transactions   the company has received advances and accrued consulting fees since inception the amount owed at july   is  the amount includes interest accruing at rates between  and     convertible notes   the company has the following notes outstanding   convertible note   matures april                   total         the note which is default adds interest of  at july   which is included in accrued expenses and is convertible to common stock    note payable   the company is obligated under a note alluded to in note  of these financial statements terms indicate a payment due in march  with interest at  the face amount of the note is  plus accrued interest of  for a total of  the note is in default    stock issuances   during the six months ended october   the company issued  shares of stock  shares for settlement of a debt of   shares of stock for services valued at market at  the company also offered under a registration statement for foreign investors or regulation s  shares of stock which has resulted in cash of        table of contents   special note regarding forwardlooking information and risk factors   certain statements in this quarterly report constitute forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements deal with our current plans objectives projections expectations assumptions strategies and future events words such as may expects anticipates intends plans believes seeks estimates will should could and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements similarly statements that describe our plans our strengths and weaknesses and other information that is not historical information also are forwardlooking statements   such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements such factors include among others the following general economic and business conditions which will among other thing impact the ability of the company to implement its business strategy   in addition to the other information contained in this report the following risk factors among others that make investment in shares of the companys common stock speculative and risky should be carefully considered   dependence on key personnel    the success of the company is largely dependent upon the continued contributions of its key management personnel the success of the company also depends upon its ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel the process of locating personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our strategies is very competitive and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel particularly in view of our poor financial position the loss of the services of our key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could limit or disrupt our future business operations   no dividends expected    we have not paid any cash or other dividends on our common shares since inception and we do not expect to pay any dividends in the future we expect to use any earnings in our operations   intense competition in the health industries    there is competition among providers both individuals and entities of various internet technologies many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than the company stronger name recognition brand loyalty and longstanding relationships with our target customers our future success is dependent upon our ability to compete and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation   limited or sporadic market quotations possible illiquidity penny stock restrictions    shares of our common stock are quoted and traded from time to time on the otc bulletin board and in the socalled pink sheets but the quotations and trading activity are limited and sporadic as a result our shareholders may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations concerning the market price of their shares our shareholders also may experience more difficulty in attempting to sell their shares than if the shares were listed on a national stock exchange or quoted on the nasdaq stock market also our common shares are classified as a penny stock because they are not traded on a national stock exchange or on the nasdaq stock market and the market price is less than  per share rules of the securities and exchange commission impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as an established customer or an accredited investor among other things a brokerdealer must make a determination that investments in penny stocks are suitable for the customer and must make special disclosures to the customer concerning the risks of penny stocks application of the penny stock rules to our common shares could adversely affect the market liquidity of the shares which in turn may adversely affect the ability of shareholders to sell their share      table of contents   item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form qsb and the annual report on form ksb for the fiscal year ended april   certain statements contained herein may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  these statements involve a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially as discussed more fully herein   the company has been inactive since the three month period ended july   and is currently under the control of a receiver in nevada’s eighth judicial district in ap as of may     results of operations   three month period ended july   as compared to the three month period ended july     during the three month period ended january   we became dormant and are currently being managed by a receiver we did not record any revenue during the three month period ended july   and have not prepared any comparison to prior periods due to relevance   liquidity and capital resources   the company had no cash on hand as of july   and had no ability to raise capital going forward   item  quantitative and qualitive discloures about market risk   risks related to our business   we have historically lost money and losses may continue in the future   we have historically lost money the loss for the fiscal year april   was  based on the company’s status as described throughout this report we current have no liquidity   we will need to raise additional capital to finance operations   our operations have relied almost entirely on external financing to fund our operations such financing has historically come from a combination of borrowings and from the sale of common stock and assets to third parties we will need to raise additional capital to fund our anticipated operating expenses and future expansion among other things external financing will be required to cover our operating costs we cannot assure you that financing whether from external sources or related parties will be available if needed or on favorable terms the sale of our common stock to raise capital may cause dilution to our existing shareholders our inability to obtain adequate financing will result in the need to curtail business operations any of these events would be materially harmful to our business and may result in a lower stock price   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses and working capital shortages which means that we may not be able to continue operations unless we obtain additional funding   the report of our independent accountants on our april   financial statements include an explanatory paragraph indicating that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses and working capital shortages our ability to continue as a going concern will be determined by our ability to obtain additional funding our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty      table of contents   our common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and may fluctuate significantly   there has been a limited public market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market for our common stock will develop as a result this could adversely affect our shareholders ability to sell our common stock in short time periods or possibly at all our common stock has experienced and is likely to experience in the future significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance in addition we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially substantial fluctuations in our stock price could significantly reduce the price of our stock   there is no assurance of continued public trading market and being a low priced security may affect the market value of our stock   to date there has been only a limited public market for our common stock our common stock is currently quoted on the otcbb as a result an investor may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our stock our stock is subject to the lowpriced security or so called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell such securities the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of  requires additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally according to recent regulations adopted by the sec any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions that we no longer meet for example brokersdealers selling such securities must prior to effecting the transaction provide their customers with a document that discloses the risks of investing in such securities included in this document are the following    the bid and offer price quotes in and for the penny stock and the number of shares to which the quoted prices apply      the brokerage firms compensation for the trade and      the compensation received by the brokerage firms sales person for the trade   in addition the brokerage firm must send the investor    a monthly account statement that gives an estimate of the value of each penny stock in the investors account and      a written statement of the investors financial situation and investment goals   if the person purchasing the securities is someone other than an accredited investor or an established customer of the brokerdealer the brokerdealer must also approve the potential customers account by obtaining information concerning the customers financial situation investment experience and investment objectives the brokerdealer must also make a determination whether the transaction is suitable for the customer and whether the customer has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be reasonably expected to be capable of evaluating the risk of transactions in such securities accordingly the commissions rules may limit the number of potential purchasers of the shares of our common stock   resale restrictions on transferring penny stocks are sometimes imposed by some states which may make transaction in our stock more difficult and may reduce the value of the investment various state securities laws pose restrictions on transferring penny stocks and as a result investors in our common stock may have the ability to sell their shares of our common stock impaired      table of contents   there can be no assurance we will have market makers in our stock if the number of market makers in our stock should decline the liquidity of our common stock could be impaired not only in the number of shares of common stock which could be bought and sold but also through possible delays in the timing of transactions and lower prices for the common stock than might otherwise prevail furthermore the lack of market makers could result in persons being unable to buy or sell shares of the common stock on any secondary market   nevada law and our charter may inhibit a takeover of our company that stockholders may consider favorable   provisions of nevada law such as its business combination statute may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company as a result these provisions could limit the price some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   we formerly maintained disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae and de of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act that are designed to be effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure currently the company has no personnel and is being managed by a receiver   controls and procedures   evaluation of and report on internal control over financial reporting   the management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule af or df promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that      pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company          provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and          provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements      table of contents   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation because of the inherent limitations of internal control there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk   management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of july   in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal controlintegrated framework   based on its assessment management concluded that as of july   the companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria   this annual report does not include
