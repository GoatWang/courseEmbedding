thanks everybody for joining us this morning were pleased to report our first quarter as the new simplified hilton with the revpar growth at the top end of our guidance range adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps results above expectations and with good progress on our recently announced share repurchase program as a result of the strong start to the year were also raising our adjusted ebitda guidance for the full year we continue to see tremendous momentum in unit growth as our share of global hotel development continues to increase we opened nearly  net rooms in the quarter and we remain on track to deliver approximately  net unit growth this year while adding over a  new signed rooms to our development pipeline we expect  to be another record year for construction starts openings and net unit growth our top line performance continues to benefit from favorable fundamentals along with market share premiums driven by our industryleading brands and commercial platform systemwide revpar increased  in the quarter helped by the easter calendar shift leisure and corporate transient both performed well and group revpar meaningfully outperformed our expectations looking forward macroeconomic forecasts are relatively unchanged since last quarter with us gdp and nonresidential fixed investment expected to outpace  growth rates modestly accelerating demand should offset forecasted supply growth allowing us to deliver a fullyear systemwide revpar growth in the  to  range driven by solid group and transient performance group position for the year remains positive with nearly  of the business on the books turning to development our pipeline increased  yearoveryear to a record  hotels and  rooms hotel owners continue to invest in our growth at a record pace accelerating our net unit growth we continued to approach our growth in a strategic and discipline way with new units coming from existing brands in both new and current markets as well as organicallydeveloped new brands targeted at incremental market segments all brand segments are at record pipelines and the pipeline mix is similar to our installed base with balanced distribution across chain scales as our growth is almost entirely financed by third parties we generate substantial returns on minimal capital investment we also generate leading returns on our owners investments which enables us to continue growing franchise rates our effective rate is currently at  systemwide and heading towards the  as contracts step up to current rates increasing roughly  basis points per year weve had great success with our new brands which have been developed at minimal cost we recently opened our first tru by hilton just  months after the brand launch the property located in oklahoma city is owned by champion hotels with more than a dozen signed trus champion hotels is an incredible supporter of the tru brand and were thrilled to celebrate this milestone with such a great partner we expect to open about  tru hotels by year end and an additional  next year there are currently  trus in various stages of development of which roughly  are with current hilton owners according to str tru represents more than  of the us industrys midscale pipeline we also continued to get great traction on our conversionoriented brands where deals can move quickly through our pipeline and add to unit growth in the year without increasing industry supply curio our fourplus star conversion brand continues to attract both domestic and international attention over the last several months we opened our first curio in the middle east and signed several projects across continental europe as of the end of the quarter we had nearly  curio hotels opened and in the pipeline our newest conversion brand tapestry by hilton sits just below curio in the threestar category at quarter end we had  projects signed or in various stages of negotiations additionally were on track to open our first tapestry in the second quarter less than six months after the brands launch in addition to new brands we think our existing brands have terrific upside especially in the international markets last week we opened our th hotel in china up from just five hotels under a decade ago today our pipeline in china totals nearly  hotels and  rooms driving our number one ranking in rooms under construction in the country and  share of total rooms under construction in the asia pacific region we celebrated a major milestone in march with the opening of the homewood suites french quarter in new orleans which is our th hotel in our allsuites brand portfolio this segment has been a really strong performer with revpar indexes over a  and we expect to have another  suite hotels open over the next two years marking another significant milestone today we actually opened the hilton rio de janeiro copacabana which is our th hotel in latin america this brings our supply in the region to more than  rooms across nine brands with another  projects in the pipeline and shows our continued commitment to strategically expanding our footprint particularly in resort destinations and key international markets were also taking full advantage of our global scale to roll out industryleading innovations guests continue to prefer our webdirect channels which made up nearly  of distribution mix in the first quarter this is our highest level ever and webdirect continues to be our fastest growing channel increasing more than  basis points in distribution mix yearoveryear our hilton honors app is downloaded every eight seconds and is the highest rated travel app providing unprecedented choice and control for guests through this app guests can check in download their digital key on their mobile device and head straight to their selfselected room upon arrival by the end of this year we expect to have digital key capability at all of our hotels in  major north american markets and  hotels globally in the first quarter honors members accounted for  of occupancy up nearly  points yearover year additionally paid member folio increased more than  as new members join the program and existing members move up the tiers enabling us to capture an even greater percentage of their travel wallet we ended up the first quarter with  million honors members up  yearoveryear postspins were a resilient feedriven business with a very disciplined strategy thats focused on growing market share units and free cash flow per share as well as preserving our strong balance sheet and accelerating our return of capital we estimate a  point change in revpar growth impacts our adjusted ebitda growth by approximately  point roughly the same as every  net unit adds on a stabilized basis this year we expect to add  to  net new rooms with great sight lines for the next couple of years given that we have nearly  rooms currently under construction given the resiliency of our model modest changes in revpar do not meaningfully impact our free cash flow generation potential and we intend to be very disciplined in returning capital to shareholders to provide more clarity we expect to return  million to a  billion to shareholders this year with around  million in the form of quarterly dividends and the full balance in share repurchases at our core and critical to our continued success we are a business of people serving people and our team members strive to provide exceptional experiences at every hotel for every guest every time i want to thank all of our team members for their hard work and commitment to our shared purpose to be the most hospitable company in the world hilton was again named one of fortunes  best companies to work for our inclusion on fortunes list is a very prestigious ranking and i think a fantastic acknowledgement of where we stand when measured against the top companies in the us and around the world this ranking is also representative of our exceptional workplace culture ranking at number  in the us we increased our position by  places this year and we ranked number  globally were really proud of this important recognition with that im going to turn the call over to kevin wholl give you a little bit more details on the quarter and our outlook kevin kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc thanks chris and good morning everyone for the quarter system wide revpar grew  versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis which was at the highend of our guidance due to good transient demand and strong group performance we estimate the easter calendar shift boosted revpar growth by  basis points in the quarter adjusted ebitda of  million exceeded the high end of our guidance range driven by better than expected fee growth good cost control at both the corporate and property levels and onetime items roughly half of the beat was related to timing and should not impact fullyear forecasts diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was  exceeding the highend of our guidance range and increasing nearly  yearoveryear on a pro forma basis in the quarter management franchise fees grew  versus the prior year to  million well ahead of our  to  guidance range in addition to timingrelated items outperformance was driven by greater than expected incentive management fees and franchise sales turning to our regional performance and outlook we believe that our broad geographic diversity coupled with the resiliency of our feebased model helps mitigate the impact of regional uncertainties following the spins no single market or gateway city accounts for more than  of our adjusted ebitda and international travelers comprise less than  of our us room night demand in the us comparable revpar increased  in the quarter driven by strong group performance we estimate oil and gas markets pressured growth by  basis points representing a significant improvement versus the prior nine quarters for full year  we continue to forecast us revpar growth towards the midpoint of our  to  systemwide range in the americas outside the us first quarter revpar grew  versus the prior year due to strength in mexico and canada driven by good group performance for full year  we expect revpar growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range revpar in europe grew a strong  in the quarter ahead of expectations due to transient strength in london and a notably strong march for italy spain and the mediterranean region additionally international inbound to the uk was up nearly  in the first quarter helped by favorable exchange rates and increased travel from the middle east for full year  we expect revpar growth in the region to be modestly above the high end of our range in the middle east and africa revpar declined  in the quarter which was in line with our expectations as supply challenges and political unrest in certain markets continue to weigh on results modest improvement in egypt helped mitigate weakness for full year  we expect revpar growth in the region of flat to slightly positive in the asia pacific region revpar increased  in the quarter led by stronger than expected growth in china and solid performance in japan for full year  we expect revpar growth in the midsingle digits with revpar in china up in the  to  range moving onto capital allocation we paid a quarterly cash dividend of  per share during the quarter for a total of  million our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of  per share for the second quarter as chris mentioned we initiated our stock buyback program in march and have since repurchased over  million shares for a total of  million the previously announced hna acquisition of  million hilton shares or a  equity interest from blackstone closed in march establishing a longterm investment in hilton we believe this strategic partnership will be mutually beneficial as both companies leverage their networks and relationships turning to our balance sheet we successfully executed over  billion in financial transactions in the first quarter including amending and extending our  billion of term loans refinancing our  billion of senior notes and unwinding and replacing our interest rate swap portfolio collectively these transactions lowered our cost of debt by  basis points reduced our interest rate risk with roughly  of our debt now at fixed rates and extended our average debt maturity by approximately a year and a half we now have no meaningful maturities for six years for the second quarter of  we expect systemwide revpar growth to be  to  with the unfavorable calendar shift likely resulting in growth in the lower half of the range we expect adjusted ebitda of between  million and  million and diluted eps adjusted for special items of between  and  as chris mentioned we are maintaining our fullyear  revpar growth guidance of  to  but are raising our adjusted ebitda outlook to a range of  billion to  billion we expect the return between  million and  billion to shareholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases were also raising diluted eps adjusted for special items to  to  for the year please note that our fullyear eps range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases further details on our first quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning this completes our prepared remarks we would now like to open the line for any questions you may have in order to speak to as many of you as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question denise can we have our first question please questionandanswer session operator certainly sir we will now begin the question and answer session and your first question will come from felicia hendrix of barclays please go ahead felicia hendrix  barclays capital inc hi good morning christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning felicia felicia hendrix  barclays capital inc hello chris since you last reported last quarter were talking about some of the postelection euphoria and since you last reported some of thats worn off but theres certainly been fits and starts in sentiment particularly now as the president is trying to put through an ambitious tax plan that could be very favorable for business so certainly the sentiment plays a role in lodging demand and im wondering have you seen group demand and business transient demand ebb and flow with different ways of sentiment or has the uncertainty regarding various administration policies caused corporate customers to sit on their hands again christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah thats a great question and i think one thats on everybodys mind to sort of get to the fundamentals of whats going on with demand in the business what i would say is breaking it apart into the two segments first on the transient side weve seen it in the leisure transient remained relatively healthy we havent seen lot of ebb and flow there both pre and post elections if you think about pre and post election with business transient which had increasingly preelection i think we all know become quite anemic to flattish postelection we saw it step up a little bit and weve seen it remain pretty consistent since so we saw a little bit of postelection bump and its remained i mean week by week obviously things move around but if you have sort of cleansed the data our read of the data is its been relatively consistent we havent seen any further pickup i think my opinion is there is potential to see further pickup i mean youre looking at some – while the gdp print in the first quarter was quite weak there is certainly i think still an expectation that gdp growth as i said in my prepared comments is going to be better this year than last year if you look at nonresidential fixed investment numbers which have a very high correlation to demand growth in the hotel business the fourth quarter of last year was the first quarter in a while you all saw it go positive and the first quarter was quite positive i mean its almost – its very high singledigits now if you look at the data generally improvement in business transient will be in a lag to that – to nonresidential fixed investment numbers going up so i think if you look at those numbers theres a bit of a reason for optimism i think ultimately time will tell i mean its early in the year its early in the trump administration and this legislative agenda and i think we need to see it play out i think to see it go from a little bit of a bump postelection to see further upside i think you have to see some things settle down theres still a decent amount of uncertainty around certain foreign policy issues going on and the legislative agenda health care tax reform infrastructure the regulatory i think the regulatory is pretty stable and i think people view that as quite positive healthcare unclear maybe have clarity in the shortterm tax policy a lot of work being done on that and a lot of thinking going on on infrastructure so i think as those things play out and you have a little bit more certainty particularly if its viewed as positive in the business community and i would say tax reform being the most important of those i think there is potential to see incremental increases again having said that what were seeing is relative stability at the moment on the group side which weve had tons of questions about not surprisingly theres been lot of dialogue about it over the last week or so what i would say is we feel pretty good about the group side id say if you look at system wide group performance in the first quarter we covered it in the prepared comments frankly it was a lot better than we thought it would be in that of course you had the easter effect which helped but we knew the easter effect was coming it was better even factoring for the easter effect if we look at the full year forecast for what we think for group at the moment its a bit a better than it would have been a quarter ago or two quarters ago so that we feel good about that if we look at our current position systemwide on the books we feel pretty good about it and it certainly supports what we think we need to deliver in the group side for the year if you look at the pace numbers which i think people have been focused on you got to parse those really carefully because everybody sort of defines it in slightly different way so i would sort of break it down maybe into three categories pace in the quarter in the first quarter for the quarter – in the quarter so very shortterm group business was actually up quite nicely okay so that was positive pace in the quarter for the full year of  was down marginally that should be expected and it follows the pattern that weve seen over this recovery in the last few years which is youd very occupancy levels youre lapping over high occupancy levels you have  of your group business on the books and so sort of the math – the math on that is you would generally see some of the pace and position numbers decline a little bit as the year goes on another i think really important pace number is looking at in the quarter – in the first quarter what were bookings like for all future periods not just this year but into the – in the future years and that was up pretty meaningfully so again i think generally support of a feeling reasonably good about group april we got the date on the last couple of days pace was up quite nicely in april obviously the beginning of the second quarter by the way april overall even though you have the reverse of the easter effect i will say performance wise april is better than we thought it would be and as we look at in the   the position is quite – is quite strong so maybe more than you wanted to know but i know a lot of questions on this i think that we feel fine relative to the range of guidance that weve given overall and i think groups contribution to that i think we feel – we feel good about group for the year and group going forward felicia hendrix  barclays capital inc thanks you answered like all five of my followup questions christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc okay felicia hendrix  barclays capital inc thank you thanks christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc okay operator the next question will come from stephen grambling of goldman sachs please go ahead stephen grambling  goldman sachs  co hey good morning thanks for taking the question christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning stephen grambling  goldman sachs  co in the past you talked to the – good morning – you talked to the benefits of network effects for the whole company as you look at the pipeline growth and revpar growth in international market specifically which continue to build are you already getting the benefits of those network effects and what are the key puts and takes to think about the pace of the international pipeline going forward christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc thats a good question i would say i dont think that were fully getting the benefits of the network effect it depends where you are in a world where – where we built out places where we built out broader distribution we are getting more of the benefit but there is – none of them have been built out to the same degree as steve as we have in the us so i think that there is certainly opportunity there i mean one gauge i dont have the exact numbers in my head but ill tell you if you look at our average market share in the us versus the other mega regions the other mega regions have very good market share and rapidly approaching the market share of the us but not quite there so i think there is still more opportunity in that regard i think as time goes on by just by definition of the scale of our existing footprint and the size of the population centers outside the us and our underrepresentation i mean were in  countries in the world we are in a lot of places but we are at the tip of our iceberg of international growth if you just do the math thats increasingly over the next  years or  years youre going to see our percentage growth coming from other places around the world so were really – i mean we look at these market share numbers as you can imagine every week we visit with our teams around the world and i have been really pleased in the last two years or three years that those market share numbers are supporting our theory of the network effect that as were building out broader distribution in other parts of the world that we are rapidly sort of approaching similar market share numbers but in terms of ultimate growth potential i think the sky is the limit i mean you think about the populations around the world that we can serve and you think about the layering of existing brands let alone newer brands that were launching we have tremendous and i would say sort of certainly for my lifetime unlimited opportunity to continue to grow stephen grambling  goldman sachs  co and then as a quick followup where was your revpar index in those other markets compared to the us are you seeing those close the gap similar to how the us market has matured thanks christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah i mean i said that i think they are both on an annual basis quarterbyquarter moves around i think they are both within a couple of hundred basis points of the other mega region emea and apac are within a  basis points  basis points of the us and theyve been moving up materially over the last few years at a rapid pace stephen grambling  goldman sachs  co thanks operator the next question will come from shaun kelley of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead shaun c kelley  bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning everyone christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning shaun c kelley  bank of america merrill lynch may be just to touch on a pretty specific one as it relates to the guidance we noticed that you raised your fee guidance from  to  up to  to  it looks like for this quarter fee numbers came in much better than expected so number one just whats driving the increase in guidance and then number two if you could is there some room for some of those same line items to possibly continue to improve as we move throughout the year kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah shaun its kevin the increase in the fee guidance for the year is pretty much – i think i mentioned it in my prepared remarks that about half of the beat was timingrelated items and half of the beat was just pure performance and a good chunk of that was in the fees so what youre seeing is kind of carrying through the beat to the full year guidance for the balance of the year and so of course if we ended up – if we were to end up near the high end of the range on revpar over the course of the year of course the fee guidance could continue to go up but that one point increment in the range is just the carry through from the first quarter beat shaun c kelley  bank of america merrill lynch and to be specific kevin just as my followup it was primarily imf and is it a initial franchise fees and anything youre seeing on that initial franchise fee line item we should know about kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc no it was kind of broad based right i mean the revpar came in at the high end of the guidance so thats going to push fees to the high end and then imf was a little bit better and then franchise sales which is a combination of change of ownerships and new deals was better than we thought some of that timing and some of its just better than we thought so its pretty broad based on the fee side shaun c kelley  bank of america merrill lynch thank you very much kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc sure operator the next question will be from harry curtis of nomura instinet please go ahead harry curtis  nomura instinet hey good morning everyone christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning harry curtis  nomura instinet i wanted to go back to a comment that chris made about leading returns to owners can you just walk through what do you think is driving that and its sustainability is what youre doing easily – can it be easily copied by your competitors christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc certainly i dont believe it can be easily copied i think harry its a complicated answer obviously but i think at its core its about having better more consistent brands which means product that is in each and every one of the brands and categories consistent service delivery that is consistent ultimately a commercial platform that is hitting on all cylinders all elements of sales in our res systems and revenue management and our online business and marketing and all of those things sort of coming together to drive performance and then the other thing that it is not easily replicable is you can have really good products really consistent service and good commercial engines but in my humble opinion without having a network effect meaning having broad price point distribution as well as geographic distribution you just by definition cant take as much of a share of wallet from customers and as a consequence you cant drive the same level of market share so its all of those things which of course im going to say i run the company and we are going say that we think theyre unique we dont think – we think we are one of a very limited number of people that have a real network effect and in terms of having the purest brand portfolio in the business we think we got it meaning that every one of our brands in every category is either the leader or a category killer in its segment there is no dogs in the bunch so when owners come to us for various needs that they have where they are following demand patterns whatever those might be or whatever type of product or price point we have a great product to give them where were going to drive consistently marketleading market share and thats what theyre investing in they are investing in a system to drive topline and bottomline performance and drive the best return i think the fact that weve been able to lead the industry in driving growth and doing it organically without having to use our balance sheet in any meaningful way its a pretty darn good testimonial to that now we have to keep doing it so we have to make sure that as we launch new products theyre great products that they really resonate with customers that we have consistency and the high quality that service delivery i said were a business of people serving people and we are – service delivery matters a lot but that network effect of connecting all of those dots around geography and price point matters a whole lot and i think ultimately what we have is awfully unique harry curtis  nomura instinet thanks chris christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah operator the next question will come from joe greff of jpmorgan please go ahead joseph r greff  jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning joe joseph r greff  jpmorgan securities llc chris before in your development pipeline commentary you mentioned that  of the pipeline is under construction which gives you pretty good visibility to net rooms growth you also referenced in the press release that construction starts in the first quarter are up  or nearly  from year ago levels whats driving that is it simply developers just wanted to get in front of interest rate moves and accelerate the financing timeline christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc those yeah joseph r greff  jpmorgan securities llc or is it something else and then christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc no joseph r greff  jpmorgan securities llc also the  rooms in the pipeline what percent of those projects are fully financed at this point christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc i probably cant answer the second ill ask kevin to take a shot at it but the – in terms of the first the numbers are accurate were up construction starts  i do not think that we will be up  in construction starts for the full year okay just to be clear that is an accurate data point i think for the year it will be less than that whats driving the first quarter and thats going to help us a lot in the year is i think that were sort of firing on all cylinders in all segments but the thing that really accelerated first quarter was tru new brand launch lots of trus getting under construction its the lowest price point we have in terms of cost per room to build much more financeable than a lot of other products in a financing market that is sort of stable but got a little bit tighter it remains a little bit tighter so i think proportionally were getting more of the financing dollars the other driver of it was huge good things going on in china with limited service particularly with our deal with plateno a ton of new hamptons that went under construction in the first quarter and were going to have a ton more coming but my sense is it will stabilize out that the tru and the hampton in china help supercharge the first quarter a bit in terms of the  in the pipeline it will be under construction certainly half of it – that would be financed half of its under construction so its financed so i would say somewhere around the order of  to  because there is a  or  and im sort of guesstimating that would be on the verge of getting under construction or probably committed so conservatively id probably say  kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah i think thats probably right joe its hard to have perfect visibility and the other thing to think about is i think most of the focusedservice projects particularly in the us they may not be technically fully financed but theyll get financed because most of the folks who are building those are repeat developers theyve really strong relationships with their regional banks and at the end of the day if its a viable project theyre going to get it financed but i think chris guess is pretty good but its hard to have full visibility into that joseph r greff  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you guys kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc sure operator the next question will come from carlo santarelli of deutsche bank please go ahead carlo santarelli  deutsche bank securities inc hey everyone thanks and good morning christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning carlo santarelli  deutsche bank securities inc chris you spoke a little bit about business transient trends and kind of what you saw preelection postelection and if we go back to when you guys spoke in february on your q earnings call i think one of the comments that you made was if you can get business transient in that  to  range that would maybe lead to the higher end of your  to  guidance range for the year could you maybe comment on how things have shaped up since then and kind of where youre tracking relative to those metrics christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc thats a good question id say were probably tracking in that zone there is no ways weektoweek and monthtomonth but id say were in the  to  zone and as we were sitting around every monday morning and i started with ec call with all of our senior folks from around the world i did it yesterday like i do every monday and we go through the performance in every major regions of the world and id say theres generally a level – a decent level of optimism in all of our – from all of our folks coming out of april where if we look at all of the regions i think everybody felt like april was trending better and as they go into may and june theyre feeling reasonably good so to get to the higher level of range id say right now and we gave you  point range in outcome because its early in the year okay and i think thats the prudent thing to do if you put me on the spot a little bit where – if i had to refine that more or where do i think itll be honestly what i see right now real time in talking to our teams and looking at the data i would say wed be at the mid to the high point thats what forecasting current forecasting would suggest now there is a lot to play out in the year there is a lot going on we talked about legislative agenda foreign policy there is lot out there but weve got – its not roaring but we got pretty good stability in the range of outcome that we talk about and business transient leisure transient hanging in there and i gave you a long soliloquy on group that makes me feel with our position in group for the rest of this year reasonably good that its going to deliver what we want to deliver there so yeah were in that zone and i will say we feel good about delivering or suggesting were going to deliver carlo santarelli  deutsche bank securities inc great thats helpful and if i may just a quick followup obviously you guys have the dividend in place offering about  yield now when you think about  and growth in the business how are you thinking about the trajectory of the dividend and maybe what kind of benchmarks are you using in terms of thoughts to grow it christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah i mean were really sort of in the  or  of free cash flow so as the free cash flow goes up i think there could be some modest increases in the dividend i would guide you to not expect that this year i mean i think were going to be stable with where we are but there well be potential in future years as free cash flow goes up i mean we – as you probably gathered from our commentary were a lot more focused on returning capital in the form of buybacks we obviously want to have a dividend we want yield investors to be able to invest in the stock but in terms of driving great sort of market leading total returns to shareholders over a long period of time we think being relatively modest on the dividend side and much more robust as robust as we can on the buyback side is going to lead to the best longterm returns carlo santarelli  deutsche bank securities inc thats great thank you very much operator the next question will come from jeff donnelly of wells fargo please go ahead jeff j donnelly  wells fargo securities llc good morning guys christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning jeff j donnelly  wells fargo securities llc just maybe the first part of the question chris im just curious and i know that politicians have thrown out some new tax plans im just curious how potential the new tax policy affects your thinking on capital allocation and leverage i recognize its a little bit of waitandsee but i just wasnt sure what might be kind of in your thoughts christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah it is definitely a little bit early and its waitandsee i mean theyve thrown some things out there and weve had some pretty good discussions with folks that are on the point on this to get a bit of a sense of whats going on behind the scenes i think theyre darn serious about getting something done and i would not at all be surprised if when we finish this year it is something done or something is pretty well baked in getting done i think from my point of view whatever theyre going to do – all of the options that were looking at i think are going to be good for our business i think now it could turn out a different way but certainly everything thats sort of being fancied about the net result for us is positive meaning that its going to ultimately drive more free cash flow and so it doesnt really change in any way our capital allocation policy it just may change the amount of capital that we have to allocate meaning if taxes go down free cash flow goes up our belief is and our strategy will be to return all of that cash flow back to shareholders too again largely in the form of incremental buyback so i think same plan just may have – if they get something good done well have more to play with jeff j donnelly  wells fargo securities llc and then just a followup i mean setting asides for these macroeconomic drivers like nonresidential fixed investment for a moment what are some of the positive and negative considerations from the operatings out of the industry that are really shaping your outlook is that the pricing pressure from supply maybe offset some of the strong pipeline deliveries you have or do you see an ability to renegotiate with ota i was kind of curious of what bubbles up from the industry itself that really drives your view on hilton christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc well i mean thats a complicated question and i am not exactly sure there is a succinct way of answering and i think its sort of a combo platter of everything i mean our model now as weve talked about is pretty simplified i mean its really focused on continuing to do everything we can with our brands and our commercial strategies to drive share so we drive unit growth and if we do those two things and outperform were going to drive incremental cash flow which were going to give back to shareholders and so there are a whole bunch of things sort of bubbling around the industry that are going to contribute to that whether that be on ota renegotiations over time which will obviously continue to take place whether that be finding other distribution partners that are very efficient distribution partners that allow us to have access to new customer bases importantly our direct strategies which weve talked a lot about over the last couple of years and are going to be strategies that go far into the future this evolution of honors and having it be a real club that everybody wants to be a member of has a real value for both frequent and infrequent travelers there is a huge amount of opportunity still left there to continue to take what  online business and grow it to a much higher share of our business so there are multitude of things that were going to do on the commercial side there are multitude of things that were going to continue to do with our existing brands to make sure they continue to be relevant new brands which weve talked about weve launched one this year weve got four more in the skunkworks which obviously will help us deliver from a hilton point of view incremental growth but importantly its going to help us further that network effect that i talked about to give us an opportunity to serve you and more of our existing customers bring new customers into the fold so there is a bunch of company specific industry related things that were going to do but its – again i can go on for a long time its a complex strategy but the ultimate goal and sort of the holy grail is share you know its all of those things are – so that we can drive incremental share to drive incremental profitability to owners so they want to continue to invest tens of billions of dollars in our system jeff j donnelly  wells fargo securities llc its helpful thanks operator the next question will come from jared shojaian of wolfe search please go ahead jared shojaian  wolfe research llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question you talked about some timing technical difficulty  kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc we cant  christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc your line is breaking up unfortunately jared shojaian  wolfe research llc im sorry can you hear me better now kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc unfortunately no operator im sorry sir your line is breaking up i need to move on to the next question and that will be from smedes rose of citi please go ahead smedes rose  citigroup global markets inc hi thanks i wanted to just followup on the development question im just wondering have guys seen any change in the willingness of local lenders to finance developments just from say versus a year ago do you think thats getting easier or harder to bring a new property to market christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc i think on the margin its stable i think throughout the second half of last year and maybe a little bit of this year but really second half of last year it became incrementally the market became a little tighter a little harder terms were a little tougher the loantovalues were a little lower pricing a little higher all of those things my sense in talking to our development teams and lots of owners is that its relatively stable certainly i would say relatively stable for the owners that are very good borrowers that have been out doing this as a part of their business over an extended period of time so from the last quarter not any material change smedes rose  citigroup global markets inc okay thanks and then just a quick – its a small question but your conrad hotels showed a revpar decline in the quarter driven by  decline in rates and i was just wondering if there were something in particular there that was going on that was maybe seasonal or regional kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc those – just a couple of individual hotels it means its not that many hotels so a couple of individual hotels that had just off group pace for the quarter and a couple offgroup pace  christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc for the full year the numbers are fine but yeah this is small enough system where you have a couple of hotels have a huge impact smedes rose  citigroup global markets inc okay great thank you operator the next question will come from thomas allen of morgan stanley please go ahead thomas allen  morgan stanley  co llc hey good morning just in terms of your major christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning tom thomas allen  morgan stanley  co llc good morning your major corporate customers were there any industry verticals that really stood out in terms of underperforming or outperforming christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc not really in preparation for the group – the call im going through our quarterend numbers i had our sales folks in here ask them the very same question nothing really stood out they said its been generally consistent as between industries i mean maybe with the energy sector being the exception where youre starting to see a little bit of outperformance relative to where its been given whats going on in the energy sector but otherwise pretty consistent thomas allen  morgan stanley  co llc great and then china any more granularity about what are the strength in that quarter and what raised – drove you to raise your guidance for that segment or country thanks kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc well weve raised guidance a little bit for the year because we performed at  for the quarter we are just seeing part of it is hotels ramping up more strongly part of it is the economy is holding in in china and maybe a little bit of overlapping of some of the constraints that were going on last year in china thomas allen  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc sure operator the next question will come from robin farley of ubs please go ahead robin m farley  ubs securities llc great so two follow ups from something you discussed earlier first is when you talked about the pace of group in the year i wonder if you could comment on how rate trended during q for forward periods and i have one other follow up christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc i dont have that data my recollection they can look for it my recollection is that was up modestly robin m farley  ubs securities llc okay and then the other revenue lines and you gave a lot of color that was helpful on kind of incentive management fees and franchise fees the other revenue line was up about  million which is lot of maybe with the close to the dollar amount of ebitda beat i wonder if you could give a little bit of color on what was in the other revenue line that was kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc yes some of therobin some of the one – i mentioned i think – i did mention that half of the beat was onetime items and they were just a couple of – sorry timing items and a couple of timing items were in that other fee category that just shows up in other revenues so thats why you saw that spread there and that will normalize over the course of the year robin m farley  ubs securities llc okay is it the same color on what some of the items might have been christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc i dont want to get into specifics so just a couple of random things we can talk a little bit more about specifics if you want offline robin m farley  ubs securities llc sure okay all right thank you operator the next question will come from chad beynon of macquarie please go ahead chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc great thanks sticking with a geography question regarding your performance in europe which was up  stronger than we had thought and i believe the segment accounts for  of your ebitda so it is fairly important your guidance of slightly above the  to  could you elaborate just a little bit in terms of why you expect to see the deceleration is that just a factor of comps or maybe just being a little cautious there thanks kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc sorry chad what region are you talking about chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc europe kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah maybe i think europe was obviously particularly strong in the first quarter were expecting some of that to normalize over the course of the year we still think it will above the high end and thats just pretty much all that went into that chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc okay great and then regarding the buybacks could you help us think about programmatic versus opportunistic and how the april buybacks kind of fit into that thesis thanks christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah i think weve tried to be abundantly clear on what we intend to do this year at this point  million to  billion total minus  million in dividends so  million to  million of buybacks all of which were doing essentially programmatically the course were on we just i think began the program on march  because we had to get the approvals from our board of directors and all those things that you guys saw so i think where if you were to look at what we did in the month of april march and april combined i think were on a trajectory to sort of be in that range and if were not well will obviously adjust the range a large part of that period of time was under a plan that we couldnt alter because we were in a quiet period so it was clicking along based on a predetermined grid we can obviously now postearnings adjust that grid and we will if appropriate to get to the numbers that weve talked about chad beynon  macquarie capital usa inc great thank you christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yes operator the next question will be from david beckel of bernstein research please go ahead david james beckel  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi thanks so much i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about international trends inbound into the us its been a while since the couple of failed attempts to enact any sort of travel ban by the administration has that caused any sort of pullback in corporate or group activities that youve seen christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc if you look at the broader trend interestingly last year international revenues – revenues from international arrivals was down about  so it was off for a host of reasons id say last year predominantly the strength of the dollar maybe a little bit what was going on post election but there wasnt a whole lot of year left post election so i think it was predominantly dollar if you look at it in the first quarter which is obviously at this point the only data that we have revenues from international inbound business was actually up a little bit i mean not a lot i mean its sort of flat to up  and it but its not consistent from the various places around the world but if you look at the – you break the world apart it was up from canada and up from asia pacific it was down from mexico and down from the middle east i think in part related to some of the things that are going on politically the net of which was – it was up a little bit i think where the dollar is today and some of the other things that are going on our expectation is for this full year that youre going to see international business down a little bit maybe sort of circa notwithstanding was up in the first quarter maybe circa where it was in – where it was for the last year now a lot of things can play out and change – change that outcome strengthening or weakening of the dollar the dollar has sort of backed up a little bit which is helping now were getting ancillary benefit europe now is a decent chunk of our business and arrivals with the weakening of the pound over time and these are the things that are going on youve seen that part of the reason youre seeing europe surge and have such strength and why its an expectation of being performance wise above the high end of our guidance ranges so we do pick some of the back up over there now as kevin mentioned in his remarks its about  of our system wide business so its moving obviously being positive is always better but these are the types of movements that were talking about dont have a material impact on the bottom line result and certainly dont have any material impact on our ability to drive cash flow david james beckel  sanford c bernstein  co llc very helpful thanks christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah operator the next question will come from michael bellisario of baird please go ahead michael j bellisario  robert w baird  co inc thanks good morning christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning michael j bellisario  robert w baird  co inc we havent touched on the credit card yet which sounds like it could be a nice catalyst could you provide an update on where you stand with those negotiations and then how we should maybe think about the potential upside to earnings if and when that deal gets inked christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah i think we talked about it a little bit on the last call and the update is that we are still in our process we went out and we did an rfp i think the good news is were nearing the end of that process i am hopeful that were actually going to be able to get it done in the second quarter were in fairly advanced stages of negotiation so im not going to be able to give you any sense of where its going to end up because were not done i will say at a high level i think its going to be very good for everybody involved meaning i think its going to be great for our customers because were going to create a customer value proposition thats far better than what we have today which i think ultimately is good for them and will help us drive incremental share its going to be great for our overall system in terms of driving more business into the system and its going to be great for us in the sense of driving more fees from that segment of our business i know youd like to know what it is but its not done and so im going to stop there and when we get it done well give you a little bit better sense of it michael j bellisario  robert w baird  co inc perfect thats helpful thank you operator the next question will come from bill crow of raymond james please go ahead bill a crow  raymond james  associates inc hey good morning chris i was looking at the christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc good morning bill bill a crow  raymond james  associates inc  i was looking at the – good morning – the lodging econometrics report last week on the us pipelines and what struck me was that your i think its  or so hotels that are in the pipeline so few of those are traditional full service conrad waldorf the hilton christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc you are talking about the us bill a crow  raymond james  associates inc im sorry – us yes us christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc okay bill a crow  raymond james  associates inc and im – what im wondering is how do you think about the aging stock of traditional full service hotels whether that opens the door for more nontraditional competition and how that may shift your fee income over a longerterm basis as youre more dependent upon selectservice hotels than you are full service hotels going forward christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah i think if you look bill its a great question if you look at our pipeline and compare to any of the major competitors so you look at the overall numbers across the entire us system youre seeing the bulk of the development go on in a limitedservice space there is a real simple reason for it you and i and i think everybody knows it and thats – that is – thats where the demand growth is thats where the economics work and thats why owners are investing money to build new properties in those segments because theyre getting the returns there and when you look at the costs to build and to operate and cost to build new construction for full service and luxury it works in a few places but it doesnt work in many i mean we have – we have a bunch of stuff going on i think we have more luxury stuff going on in the us than anybody we just opened conrad in chicago were getting to go under construction in dc the waldorf beverly hills is going to open next month i mean if you add up we get going out in the us in luxury probably – i think more than anybody upper upscale we are doing great relative to our competitive set therere just not a lot of it going on because its not justified because construction costs continue to go up throughout the great – after the great recession and through now in a way where it makes it in most markets quite difficult having said that in terms of our existing stock of hotels were very focused and have been on making sure that were keeping those up to snuff so in the end while were are not – this development cycle doesnt involve a ton of of upper upscale and luxury for us or anybody by the way it doesnt mean that were not cycling through and being very thoughtful about the existing products we have whether thatd be doubletree hilton embassy or above and making sure that were doing everything we need to do to make sure that the product is relevant and that it ultimately can be competitive and so i feel great about what weve been doing in the capital investment side with our owners because particularly now postspin this is not  we are not the owner of anything in the us market but if you go around and look at whats opening you go around and look at what were refurbishing around the country i feel really good about but this is – this is a phenomena thats driven by underlying economics and im not going to say that at same point youre eventually going to get back in the full service and luxury development at a larger scale i dont know if its in this cycle though because i dont see economics that on a wholesale basis are going to support it for some time and again selectively its being supported because were obviously doing some of it and so are our competitors but wholesale i think the game is in limited service and i think thats an important nuance to our model because i know theres noise out in the market from competitors and the like – i think in the end our model is a capitallight model and ultimately were trying to serve customers and the way we serve customers is giving the products they want in the locations they want it with service delivery that is in keeping with the particular price point that theyre – that theyre willing to pay for and given that were not investing were investing – its third parties thats investing this capital what were doing around the world is following demand patterns and the capital is following that demand pattern and so in the us that means a lot of limited service by the way around the world that means a lot of limited service it doesnt mean that were not going to do tons of luxury and upper upscale and all those things it just means that with a growing middle class around the world a huge amount in the next  years or  years or  years of demand growth is going to be in the midmarket and by the way im very proud to say we are really happy to serve the midmarket particularly given that every time we add one its a  margin and an infinite yield so the more we do the more money we make and the more money you make and the better we serve our customers and the greater network effect that we create again thats not to say were not going to do tons of hiltons and embassys and doubletrees and conrads and waldorfs were going to do those too when the economic rationale supports it and we can deliver for owners returns commensurate with their investment bill a crow  raymond james  associates inc great answer thank you christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah thank you operator the next question will be from rich hightower of evercore please go ahead richard allen hightower  evercore isi hi good morning guys thanks for taking the questions here just two quick followups on the capital return side first of all in terms of repurchases and not being included in eps guidance for the year is there a technical reason for that since we kind of sort of already know what the number is going to be kevin j jacobs  hilton worldwide holdings inc yeah its just – rich its just a standard that weve decided to take you dont know at what price youre going to buyback so why guess the share count going forward there is nothing more to it than that richard allen hightower  evercore isi all right clear enough thanks kevin and then a second one on back to the dividend policy question to the extent tax reform does happen and the rates on dividend income change would that in theory potentially change your dividend policy or would you seek to kind of keep the payout roughly the same and the balance with buybacks as you christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc i think the idea is well keep it roughly the same unless something really radical happens i would never say never we want to be intelligent depending on what happens in the world but based on everything we are hearing that is possible in terms of outcome it would not change our philosophy on the dividend richard allen hightower  evercore isi all right thanks chris thats all i got christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc you bet operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to hand the conference back over to chris nassetta for his closing remarks christopher j nassetta  hilton worldwide holdings inc thanks everybody again for joining us this morning its great to be in our
