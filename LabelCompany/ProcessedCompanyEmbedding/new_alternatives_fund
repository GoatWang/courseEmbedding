world of stocks bonds exchangetraded funds and other prepackaged products there is a whole universe of alternative investment vehicles that you should be aware of alternative investments include venture capital private equity hedge funds real estate investment trusts commodities as well as real assets such as precious metals rare coins wine and art these assets usually perform with low correlation to stocks and bonds may be difficult to value and are generally more illiquid than traditional investments liquid alternatives are an asset class that has developed in the last few years and includes etfs and mutual funds that are traded publicly and managed to mimic the performance of an alternative asset class or strategy for the purposes of this article we do not include liquid alternatives in our definition of alternative investments with some exceptions only accredited investors are able to invest directly in the assets described above this restriction exists because many fund managers rely on private placement registration exemptions that limit their investor base to sophisticated investors these investments are growing in popularity as institutional investors including pension and endowment funds are increasingly allocating money to alternative investments as they realize the longterm benefits of this asset class the yale endowment model is a case study on the benefits of hedge fund and private equity allocation the yale allocation to private equity is  of its  billion endowment fund representing a significantly larger allocation than other educational institutions the yale endowment generated  in returns in fiscal  far outpacing most endowments and has gained  per year for the past  years regulations limiting many kinds of alternative investments to accredited investors are meant to be both a sophistication test as well as a protective measure legislation hasnt been finalized to open up these alternative investments to the retail market yet the below list is meant to be a snapshot of the different opportunities that exist in a huge and increasingly complex private capital marketplace with the proliferation of technology investors can directly access and invest in alternative investment opportunities for instance using a platform such as darcmatter the company of which i am ceo it is recommended that investors consult a trusted financial advisor on what investments fit appropriately within a given portfolio and risk tolerance investors should understand the investment strategy of the fund and be comfortable with its risk profile additionally reviewing the investment professionals background and reputation is essential although the securities and exchange commission does not regulate certain private investments many managers are registered as investment advisers with the sec or state securities commission by accessing the secs investment adviser public disclosure web site or north american securities

future results the alternative investment strategies that the fund pursues are complex and may involve greater risk than traditional investments stocks bonds and cash the performance of alternative investments is not expected to correlate closely with more traditional investments however it is possible that alternative investments will decline in value along with equity or fixedincome markets or both or that they may not otherwise perform in accordance with expectations alternative investments can be highly volatile are often less liquid particularly in periods of stress are generally more complex and less transparent and may have more complicated tax profiles than traditional investments in addition the performance of alternative investments may be more dependent on a subadvisers experience and skill than traditional investments the use of alternative investments may not achieve the desired effect foreign currencies and emerging markets involve certain risks such as currency volatility political and social instability and reduced market liquidity short sales by a fund theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the funds portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the nav of the fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise to the extent that the investment advisor misjudges current market conditions the funds volatility may be amplified by its use of derivatives and its ability to anticipate price movements in relevant markets underlying derivative instruments and futures contracts the funds currency investment strategy may be impacted by currency exchange rates which can fluctuate significantly over short or extended periods of time these changes may be caused by governmental or political factors that affect the value of what the fund owns and its share price the fund may experience high portfolio turnover which may result in higher costs and capital gains the fund is a recently formed mutual fund and has a limited history of operations there can be no assurances that its objective will be met the defensive market strategies fund may be suitable for investors who have a medium to longterm investment horizon possess a moderate tolerance for risk and seek to participate in the return potential of stocks at a slightly lower risk level than an allstock portfolio this fund is subject to interest rate risk meaning when interest rates rise the value of the existing bonds decreases and vice versa changes in interest rates have a bigger impact on longduration holdings than on shortduration holdings the value of convertible securities increases and decreases with the value of the underlying common stock but may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates foreign securities may be subject to greater risk than domestic securities due to currency volatility reduced market liquidity and political and economic instability to the extent that the investment advisor misjudges current market conditions the funds volatility may be amplified by its use of short sales and derivatives and by its ability to select subadvisers to allocate assets short sales by a fund theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase leverage may increase the risk of loss and cause fluctuations in the market value of the funds portfolio to have disproportionately large
