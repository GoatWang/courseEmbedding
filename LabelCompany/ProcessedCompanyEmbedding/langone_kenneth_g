ken langone jr takes on wall street loses by michael corkery michael corkery the wall street journal biographymichael corkery mcorkery mwcorkery google michaelcorkerywsjcom dec    pm et in the langone family father is not like son – at least when it comes to investing bloomberg news kenneth langone in aug  kenneth g langone of course is a wellknown name on wall street one of the founding investors in home depot who clashed famously with thenattorney general elliott spitzer this decade over compensation practices at the new york stock exchange where langone was a director kenneth g langone jr who is called “kenny” by his father is a  yearold amateur musician living in tucson ariz who doesn’t use email or the internet and collects vintage records langone jr brought a case against morgan stanley before the financial industry regulatory authority or finra alleging that a local broker had made improper investment choices with his approximately  million account but morgan stanley argued that the younger langone was no novice and should have been aware of the investment risks according to his lawyer “they suggested that he grew up in a wall street family and knew more about investing than the average person’’ said langone jr’s lawyer mark lammers of tuscon “that’s nonsense” the elder langone said in an interview “kenny had had no interest in the business and scant knowledge of it that is why he relied heavily on his broker” langone’s father testified by phone twice on behalf of his son before a finra arbitration panel it didn’t matter last month the panel dismissed the case and made langone jr pay morgan stanley’s expert witness fees totaling  and the panel’s  of expenses “it’s unusual for the customer to be charged all of the fees” says richard ryder editor of securities arbitration commentator an online newsletter based in maplewood nj that tracks finra arbitration cases “it usually indicates some kind of implicit comment about the weakness of the claim” lammers says he is appealing some of those fees a finra spokesman declined to comment morgan stanley spokesman christy pollak said in a statement ‘the arbitrators conducted a full and complete hearing over several days heard the testimony of numerous fact and expert witnesses and concluded that mr langone’s claims should be dismissed in their entirety their award speaks for itself” in an interview the younger langone said he wants to raise awareness about the finra arbitration process which he called “the worst experience of my life” he added “i was completely unprepared to read the full story
