customer expectation has never been achieved pics offer this to happen but in the mean time  thru  if i understand this we will be selling at    ect per gig not a buck as they want that is  per device big bucks but much more exciting is slide  the vast majority of the market in ethernet txrx pics is and will be for a g pic i think this is a repeated slide the  is just icing on the cake maybe the  takes over and the projection chart will not look the same next year but the risk here is getting less and less gentlemen we already have it the g will start entering a huge market by the end of the year priced the same as the currant g and its frikkin june already the end of the presentation touches on additional markets many many more devices to come did you notice oled flexible screens is a

logic has a rich and long history in developing polymer materials for photonic devices our materials are truly world class and are now being designed into highperformance photonic devices as part of a photonics integrated circuit pic platform we are headquartered in longmont colorado and we have a second facility in newark delaware electrooptic polymer materials are synthesized in delaware to specifications driven by our technical device and pic platform teams in longmont in longmont the polymer materials are fabricated into photonic devices as part of the pic platformas can be seen from our photonics product roadmap web page in the technology section lightwave logic is currently developing highspeed photonic ridge waveguide modulators as part of the pic platform initial performance speeds are at  gbps and  gbps at  gbps we can design  channel optical subassemblies  x  gbps to enable the explosive and fast growing  gbps market opportunity in fiber communications especially for data centers and highperformance computing our roadmaps follow a route to extend our photonic device technology in ridge waveguide modulators to  gbps and enable the new and upcoming  gbps opportunities that many data centers are designing architectures for in order to reach this important data rate node in optical networking we will be designing  channel optical subassemblies  x  gbps with  gbps polymer modulators we will be also designing pam solutions so that  gbps can be enabled with only  x  gbps modulators as opposed to  pam is a protocol being used by the industry to minimize the number of photonic devices for a data rate and is based on electronic pulse amplitude modulation coding of  digital levels pam is being implemented into a number of standards today we are also exploring other modulator technologiesour polymer based photonics devices include the following advantages excellent scalability of the material device and platform the versatility and ease of production of plastic polymers in a fab the ability to become part of an integrated photonics platform or pic extreme miniaturization very highspeed performance that will enable  gbps and  gbps data rate opportunities excellent thermal stability material compatibility with silicon and cmos processes femtosecond optical response times ability to withstand a laser without bleaching out very high electrooptical activity lightwave logics vast array of unique chromophores offer all these advantages while enabling miniaturized device designs with low power and high efficiency the uniqueness of the technology platform not only enables highperformance photonic devices but photonic devices that can be integrated onto a highly functional polymer pic platform at  gbps and beyondour technology platform using polymer materials devices and pics have been protected by our company using patents and in other areas through trade secrets we continue to file patents and develop trade secrets as we innovative with more advanced designs at lightwave logic we believe that powered by the speed of light is more than the companys branding statement it is an advancement in the way of thinking for
