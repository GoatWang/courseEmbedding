mysteriesshould i invest in the realtyshares diversified marketplace equity fund so you’ve joined the real estate crowdfunding movement because you believe there are plenty of untapped real estate opportunities to profit from no longer do you need to fly to texas to kick some sheetrock to try and earn a  cap rate now you can just login to realtyshares and see what they have to offer the only problem is despite the meticulous curation of real estate crowdfunding deals on their platform you still don’t know which one to invest in because they all sound great only about  of the deals shown to the realtyshares investment committee actually pass through their rigorous screening for investors to see as a result it’s natural that all deals sound pretty good otherwise they’d hurt the real estate crowdfunding platform’s reputation realtyshares prevetting funnel to highlight only the best opportunities on their platform here’s an example of three deals to choose from which one do you invest in they all sound good yet none of us have an unlimited amount of capital one of the solutions realtyshares has come up with is to create a fund that chooses the best deals from its platform for participants let me share a quick overview of the fund according to amy kirsch the fund director what is the realtyshares diversified marketplace equity fund the dme fund works similarly to a private equity fund and somewhat like a mutual fund it will invest in  to  properties available on the realtyshares website to build a diversified portfolio that investors can participate in with a single commitment through one investment you are able to access diversification through the same platform our investors have come to know and enjoy without spending time to research and choose several smaller investments the dme fund is managed by a team of experienced real estate investment managers who have worked at major investment firms including blackrock goldman sachs prudential deutsche bank and other reputable organizations the dme fund fee is  of assets under management a discounted rate compared to the standard percentage fee when investing directly through the marketplace of  realtyshares also earns the standard fee on placements from each investment what are the guidelines for the investment fund the dme fund is mandated to invest in middle market real estate transactions which have generally outperformed the sp over the past  years according to nareit and should offer the potential for strong investment returns middle market commercial real estate includes deals under  million in value located in secondary geographic markets and noncore locations in primary markets middle market investors often find alpha in a highly fragmented market by taking advantage of information asymmetries which makes this a potential lucrative opportunity for real estate investment returns investors will own both equity and preferred equity in projects and the fund is designed to build up a sizable cashflowing portfolio while paying quarterly distributions invested capital and any gains will be returned to investors over the life of the dme fund as projects are completed paid off and the fund is ultimately drawn down to pay out all investments and profits back to investors there are risks to investing in the fund including loss of capital so it’s important to review the offering documents investments are to include commercial and multifamily projects in arizona california florida illinois new york north carolina texas and virginia we expect an average asset size ranging from  million to  million for more details on the types of investments risks and other important information check out our webpage the dme fund requires a minimum  investment and is open to accredited investors only benefits of investing in the realtyshares fund invest in a diverse portfolio of  properties with one investment discounted fees compared to directly investing in the platform passthrough delaware llc structure can take advantage of depreciation and other tax benefits expected quarterly cash distributions during hold with upside potential from profits generated by sale of assets single annual schedule k instead of one k per property access to alphagenerating potential of middle market real estate transactions investments managed by a trusted experienced asset management team the private equity structure of our fund provides investors with direct ownership of properties just like how our individual investments are set up which in turn unlike reits provides investors with greater tax benefits like depreciation write offs should you invest in the fund for those of you who believe in real estate as an asset class like the idea there is a tangible asset behind the investment but who are focused on investing and are busy focused on making money elsewhere the realtyshares fund seems like a good solution they’ve invested in an austin multifamily property hayward multifamily property and miami multifamily property so far as of q investing a total of  in the realtyshares fund i’ve decided to invest  in the realtyshares fund to start i like the fact that they have a preferred return of  and a target irr of  over the five year life of the fund i am a big proponent of investing in assets for the long term so i don’t have to think about my money the key is to maintain a diversified asset allocation for those who don’t want to pay the extra  fund fee you can simply invest in individual realtyshares deals i’m planning on doing both with
