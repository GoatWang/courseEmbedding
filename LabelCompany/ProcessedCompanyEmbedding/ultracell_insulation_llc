heat cold and condensation prodex total foil insulation  insulation rvalue   radiant barrier  vapor barrier all in one product one solution to cold heat and condensation  youll be warm in winter cool in summer and dry all the time   inch approx   mm closed cell polyethylene foam covered on both sides with  inch mm aluminum foil facing  technical brochure condensation  it can seem like a tropical rain forest inside unprotected buildings its worse on those days where there is a greater contrast between temperatures at night vs day the morning sun hitting the cool sheathing will create a drip when warm air comes in contact with the cool sheathing condensation occurs a temperature difference between the outside and inside of your building creates condensation  similar to what happens when you have a cold can of beer outside on a hot day radiant heat  midsummer sun rays hitting the sheathing radiates downward inside it can make it unbearably hot and humid inside the sheathing magnifies the heat of the summer and frigid temperatures of the winter metal is a very good conductor of heat and cold in hot weather metal framing and sheeting rapidly radiate the suns heat into a building   cold  winter temperatures turns sheathing cold the cold sheathing chills the inside of your building making it like an ice box   colder inside the building than out insulation that loses rvalue due to moisture once fiberglass insulation gets wet and it will get wet due to condensation it will lose rvalue water trapped between fiberglass insulation and the exterior of a building will also cause mold fungus growth rust and oxidation  conditions that will degrade the framing and the sheathing and shorten the service of the structure in addition fiberglass insulation does not prevent radiant heat transfer the primary source of heatflow in and outside your building take a look at the white vinyl facing the next time youre in a building  it will be either sagging or sagging and flaking this is due to the added weight of water behind the white vinyl is a wet mold filled blanket that will eventually cause the white vinyl to crack and fall off at some point when youre exposed to the toxic fibers youll be forced to remove the insulation  hopefully before it does too much damage to the framing or sheathing if you insist on using fiberglass use it in conjunction with prodex total so the prodex can keep the moisture out of the fiberglass once sheathing gets cold it can create a situation where its colder inside than out to combat this you need an insulation that doesnt lose its thermal protection like fiberglass when you need it most  cold damp conditions insulation that doesnt protect against radiant heat transfer like fiberglass spray foam insulation doesnt protect against radiant heat transfer without a radiant barrier when your roof gets hot it radiates solargenerated heat down this often results in it being hotter in your building  than out since open cell foam providers suggest you supplement open cell foam with a vapor barrier why not get the vapor barrier insulation and radiant barrier all in one product prodex total foil foam insulation solves condensation heat and cold challenges prodex total eliminates condensation prodex eliminates the moisture and ice dams from forming on roof and walls when the heat or cold from outside comes through the sheathing it hits the outside aluminum facing of prodex and is reflected back upwards through the underside of the sheathing this process keeps the sheathing temperature consistent on both sides in addition the inside layer of aluminum in prodex reflects away the heat heater or cold airconditioning from inside the building from getting to the sheathing this also helps in preventing condensation  prodex total prevents radiant heat transfer prodex reflects  of the radiant energy primary source of heat flow that strikes it prodex also reflects back the heat inside your building or home each unit of radiant heat energy that is reflected away from your building or home in the summer and each unit that is reflected back during the winter means less operation of your heating and air conditioning system  less wear and tear on your equipment  less money you pay in utility costs fiberglass and spray foam insulation do not prevent radiant heat transfer prodex total keeps you warm the prodex total rvalue is not affected by humidity this feature cannot be over emphasized there is humidity in every location  your insulation must work in these conditions what makes prodex total foil backed insulation superior to fiberglass spray and bubble rvalue  unaffected by humidity prevents  of radiant heat transfer vapor barrier prevents condensation dba contact noise reduction  degree

comparing prodex total foil faced insulation to fiberglass rigid board spray differences in foil insulation  single bubble double bubble and prodex total take a look at the photos below even if you didnt know anything about foil insulation you would likely select the correct product  prodex total foil insulation       foil only                   single bubble           double bubble           prodex total foil insulation should have quality core prodex total has a high quality core that keeps its shape when exposed to forces prodex total has a nominal thickness of mm  inch closed cell polyethylene foam covered on both sides with  mm aluminum foil facing under pressure the prodex microcells do not collapse  with a pressure of  psi prodex compresses just  when the load is relieved it takes back its initial shape the density of the foam is between  lbft sq   lbft sq this gives the material real body prodex seals around nails  thats important  most installation methods require stapling nailing or screwing the foil insulation to a surface comparison chart prodex total foil insulation to foil bubble wrap double bubble and single bubble  balloons that burst double bubble and single bubble foil insulation are composed of either one single bubble or two double bubble layers of air bubbles sandwiched between two metalized surfaces the rows of air bubbles play the important role of separating the reflective foils these products are more than just a radiant barrier theyre considered foil insulation  unfortunately air is not as effective a separator as closed cell foam therefore longterm performance can be a concern single bubble has a nominal thickness of  inch double bubble measures  inch these measurements bear little resemblance to the effective measurement of the products see photos above we see little difference between the performance of single and double bubble foil insulation the latter simply has a second layer of air bubbles a balloon with more air once either is punctured it collapses although we strongly suggest you order prodex total if your budget doesnt allow you to purchase the quality of prodex we suggest you order a single bubble foil insulation rather than a double bubble youll get virtually all the benefits of the double bubble foil insulation while saving money we do not offer double bubble foil insulation because we arent able to justify its pricing relative to prodex total or single bubble foil insulation foil only products are not insulation foil only products are typically perforated and composed of two metalized surfaces with a mesh woven in for strength it is not a vapor barrier it has no rvalue  it is not insulation per se its a thin layer of reflective low emissivity film installed with an airspace to block radiant heat transfer between a surface that radiates heat we refer to these products as foil only radiant barriers quality core surrounded by reflective foil facing  quality foil insulation prodex total foil insulation  unlike foil only products no inner substance this foil insulation protects against the energy transferred via conduction and convection prodex is a radiant barrier  reflective insulation  vapor barrier more than just a radiant barrier prodex total is one solution for heat cold and water prodex prevents condensation heat from coming in and heat from getting out of your building how to insulate with foil insulation  install instructions its a lot easier and less expensive to install a mm roll of prodex than a bulky  inch roll of fiberglass or spray foam pinching  inches fiberglass between the framing and sheathing is not easy its really tough having to use a wire mesh to hold fiberglass in place on an existing building spray foam is not diy friendly prodex total can be installed before or after your sheathing installation methods  more benefits of prodex total insulation protects content from vapor prodex is a class  vapor barrier a vapor barrier moisture barrier refers to any material that prevents moisture from passing through the walls or roof of a building this material can be plastic or better yet prodex total insulation   inch mm closed cell polyethylene foam covered on both sides with inch mm aluminum foil facing prodex total insulation vapor barrier class  perm  prodex insulation prevents rodents bugs and birds from nesting unlike fiberglass insulation prodex does not provide for the nesting of rodents bugs and birds rodents bugs and birds arent able to digest the aluminum prodex total deadens sound of rain and hail metal skin on a building can exaggerate the sound of rain and hail prodex has an excellent db sound deadening  increased lighting efficiency prodex provides a bright attractive finish to your building it reflects the light making it easier to light the building interior how do i know this is a great product prodex total is icces recognized bbb link bottom right of every page realtime customer comments on every product page independent reviews bottom right of every page to meet the unique insulation requirements of a metal roof you need a total insulation system   prodex total insulation  insulation  radiant barrier  vapor barrier foil insulation roll sizes  inch  ft x  ft  sq ft   inch  ft x  ft  sq ft  inch two rolls of  ft x  ft  sq ft    inch three rolls of  in x  ft  sq ft want white facing foil fiberglass vinyl not a prodex product r  the performance level of this product is slightly less than prodex total primarily because it only has one reflective surface  ft x  ft and  ft x ideal for commercial or residential applications where white facing is preferred radiant barrier composed of  inch fiberglass core bonded to one layer of aluminum foil facing and one layer of durable white scrimreinforced facing material fiberglass is encapsulated summary fiberglass loses rvalue with moisture neither it or spray insulation will prevent radiant heat transfer it takes more than foil and air to make a foil insulation if you only have foil and a mesh than you dont have insulation if your product is composed of air bubbles its subject to collapse in time or lose effectiveness when punctured it requires a quality core of foam and aluminum to make a great foil insulation           purchase gold membership how many     about us  contact us share this page   insulationlesscom inc
