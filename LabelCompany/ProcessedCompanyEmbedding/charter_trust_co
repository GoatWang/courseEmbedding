ability to meet your financial needs once we have a good understanding of your future needs we work together to develop a plan that will move you towards that “perfect retirement” ira rolloverstraditional iraroth irasimple irasep iraprofit sharing plank planpension planira rollovers a retirement fund “rollover” occurs when you withdraw assets from one eligible retirement plan and within  days you contribute part or all of it to another eligible plan the transaction is not taxable but needs to be reported on your federal tax return most distributions from eligible retirement plans can be rolled over except for the nontaxable part of a distribution such as your aftertax contributions to a retirement plan a distribution that is one of a series of payments based on your life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary or paid over a period of ten years or more a required minimum distribution a hardship distribution dividends on employer securities or the cost of life insurance coverage other exclusions exist for certain loans and corrective distributions if a distribution is paid to you you have  days from the date you receive it to roll it over to another eligible retirement plan any taxable amount of a distribution that is not rolled over must be included in income in the year of the distribution and if you are under  ½ at the time of distribution that portion might be subject to a  tax for early distribution traditional ira a traditional individual retirement account ira is a personal savings plan that provides tax advantages to individuals saving for retirement a traditional ira allows our investment managers to direct pretax income towards select stocks bonds and other financial assets that can grow tax deferred a traditional ira is a great way to lower your tax liability and save money for retirement if you invest  into a traditional ira you can claim that  as a tax deduction on your income taxes the deduction will lower your adjusted gross income which inturn will lower your tax liability when it’s time to start receiving distributions from your traditional ira the income is treated as ordinary income and may be subject to income tax distributions are required to start coming out of the account when you reach  ½ years of age there are additional benefits and restrictions of the traditional ira please give us a call to discuss and see if a traditional ira would be a good choice for your retirement plan roth ira a roth ira differs in many ways from a traditional ira but the primary differentiator is the roth ira does not provide the tax deduction that a traditional ira does you are taxed up front but your contributions and gains grow taxfree this makes the roth ira a great vehicle to create taxfree income and growth for your retirement portfolio a roth ira may be invested in any combination of stocks bonds mutual funds certificates of deposit and money market funds earnings are not subject to income tax provided you have held the account for  years or more and are at least age ½ your direct contributions can be withdrawn at any time and are tax free contribution limits can change year to year as can adjusted gross income limits to contribute we would be happy to spend some time reviewing your account and determining if a roth ira would be a good vehicle for your retirement portfolio there are some important benefits and restrictions of the roth ira benefits are tax free growth assets can be passed to beneficiaries after death easy withdrawal process no minimum withdrawal requirements you can have a roth ira even if you have other retirement plans restrictions are contributions are not tax deductible like they are with a traditional ira fees will be assessed   if you withdraw money before ½ unless for a variety of qualified reasons education first time home purchase medical expenses disability health insurance etc income limits on participationsimple ira the simple ira plan allows employees and employers to contribute to a traditional ira set up for employees simple stand for savings incentive match plan for employees and it is ideally suited as a retirement savings plan for small companies that do not offer a retirement plan an eligible employer may adopt a simple ira and must meet the requirements that apply to traditional iras however contributions to an employee’s simple ira are limited to employee contributions made under a salary reduction agreement and employer contributions that are made as either matching contributions or nonelective contributions the irs has issued two model forms that may be used by employers that want to establish a simple ira for their employees if the employer has established a simple plan an employee must be eligible to participate in any calendar year if he or she received at least  of compensation from the employer during each of the two preceding calendar years and is
