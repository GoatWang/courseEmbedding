division of investment firm capital research and management company revealed that it has raised its stake in avon products inc nyse avp to  shares as of june   at the end of march capital research reported ownership of  shares of avon stock capital research now owns  of avon’s outstanding stock the filing does not indicate how much the firm paid for the stock but at thursday’s closing price of  per share the value of capital research’s holdings is nearly  million it is probably safe to assume that the investment firm paid less than that for the stock the news follows by a day the
