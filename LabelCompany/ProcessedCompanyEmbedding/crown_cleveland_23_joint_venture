emmanuelliperezegaogov  office of public affairs   youngcgaogov agencys cost realism analysis of proposals and determination of most probable cost which focuses on realism of labor rates is reasonable is sufficient to meet any agency obligation to assess performance risk associated with proposals  where cost and mission suitability factors are equal warnerosborn alleges that nasas award determination is flawed for a number of reasons including nasas failure to follow either its own regulations or the rfps evaluation criteria with regard to conducting a cost realism evaluation award was to be made to the responsible offeror whose conforming proposal would be most advantageous to the government mission suitability and cost were described as the most important of the evaluation factors matter of the warnerosborngt joint venture file b date august   digest attorneys decision we deny the protest the rfp sought proposals for engineering construction and environmental services for rehabilitation modification and construction of research and institutional facilities and systems the rfp contemplated award of a levelofeffort costplusawardfee contract for a base period of  years with three year options award was to be made to the responsible offeror whose conforming proposal would be most advantageous to the government cost and other factors considered the rfp called for offerors to submit their proposals in three parts a business management proposal with cost and pricing data a business management proposal with information other than cost or pricing data eg past performance and experience financial statements plan to achieve culturally diverse work force and award fee plan and a technical proposal demonstrating the offerors thorough understanding of the requirements of the statement of work sow and three sample problems including a logical plan for providing the required services the rfp provided offerors with the governments assumption of the year levels of effort maximum  personnel  hours and minimum  personnel  hours the rfp also provided for the addition of optional increments of  hours to increase the level of effort with the addition of all increments the maximum level of effort would be  hours section m of the rfp identified four evaluation factors  mission suitability  cost  relevant experience and past performance and  other considerations mission suitability and cost were described as the most important of the evaluation factors and were weighted approximately equal in importance the last two evaluation factors relevant experiencepast performance and other considerationswere described as having somewhat less importance and considerably less importance respectively than the first two factors and were to be evaluated adjectivally cost was not scored or rated while mission suitability was weighted and scored as follows  understanding the requirements and approach to sample problems  points  management plan  points  key personnel and key positions  points and  corporate resources  points for a total of  points eight firms including warnerosborn and madison submitted proposals by the august   closing date the proposals were evaluated by a source evaluation board seb which identified the strengths and weaknesses in each proposal based upon the initial evaluation the contracting officer and chairman of the seb established a competitive range of five proposals including those of warnerosborn and madison nasa then conducted written and oral discussions with each offeror and the seb evaluated the revised proposals nasa issued model contracts to the competitive range offerors and solicited best and final offers bafos from them as part of its cost evaluation nasa obtained audits from the defense contract audit agency dcaa for each cost proposal submitted dcaas audits included a review of proposed wage rates overhead general and administrative ga costs and other direct costs dcaa and nasa cost evaluators identified various deficiencies and issues in each cost proposal and requested revisions during discussions in the evaluation of bafos nasa found that all proposals in the competitive range required adjustment to account for incumbent employee labor rates as a result warnerosborns proposal was adjusted upward by  million and madisons was adjusted upward by  million as finally adjusted for cost realism warnerosborns bafo ranged from  million for the contract without increments to  million with increments madisons bafo as adjusted ranged from  million to  million the government estimate for the maximum level of effort was  million in the final evaluation warnerosborns proposal received a mission suitability score of  points and madisons proposal received a score of  points with regard to relevant experiencepast performance warnerosborn was rated very good and madison was rated excellent for the other considerations factor the offerors proposals were rated as follows rated form omitted the sebs written report and presentation to the source selection official sso included the evaluation scores ratings strengths weaknesses and adjusted costs of all the competitive range offerors but did not recommend any proposal as most advantageous to nasa concluding that all competitive range offerors could successfully perform the contract work load the sso considered whether selection of a higherscored proposal would justify the payment of a substantial price premium he concluded that it did not and selected engineering design group edg a lowercost proposal for award edg was subsequently determined to be ineligible for award whereupon the seb made another presentation to the sso again without recommending an awardee and the sso again concluded that all offerors could successfully perform the contract and that the technical superiority of warnerosborn and another offeror were insufficient to justify the payment of the concomitant cost premiums the cost difference between warnerosborn and madison ranged from  million to  million or approximately  percent upon receiving notice of the award warnerosborn filed this protest the cost analysis warnerosborn contends that nasas cost realism analysis was either nonexistent or flawed because it did not include sufficient indepth analysis or review of proposed costs specifically the protester complains that nasa relied blindly on the dcaa audits and failed to adjust madisons costs upward to account for its inferior approach we have reviewed nasas cost analysis and find it unobjectionable when a costreimbursement contract is to be awarded a cost realism analysis must first be performed by the agency see federal acquisition regulation far secs   the purpose of a cost realism analysis by an agency under a levelofeffort costtype contract is to determine the extent to which the offerors proposed labor rates are realistic and reasonable erc envtl and energy servs co inc b feb    cpd para  in this regard an agency is not required to conduct an indepth cost analysis or to verify each and every item in conducting its cost realism analysis rather the evaluation of competing cost proposals requires the exercise of informed judgment by the contracting agency involved since it is in the best position to assess realism of cost and technical approaches and must bear the difficulties or additional expenses resulting from a defective cost analysis since the cost realism analysis is a judgment function on the part of the contracting agency our review is limited to a determination of whether an agencys cost evaluation was reasonably based and not arbitrary general research corp  compgen    cpd para  science applications intl corp b june    cpd para  warnerosborn contends that the agency improperly relied on a dcaa audit as a substitute for a cost realism analysis because the contracting officer alone is responsible for the cost realism determination see purvis sys inc  comp gen    cpd para  in fact the record establishes that nasa did not rely blindly on the results of the audits rather nasa conducted a detailed cost analysis of madisons proposal in accordance with the rfp madisons cost proposal included summaries of minimum and maximum costs as well as cost and pricing data for all proposed direct and indirect cost elements including the award fee the seb cost committee used this information in its initial evaluation to identify cost issues and concerns which formed the basis for cost questions for madison during discussions the seb questioned various aspects of madisons costs including the accuracy of estimates and inclusions under other direct costs and sought clarifications of certain markup items nasa also had dcaa perform audits on the cost proposals of madison and its subcontractors identifying concerns and making recommendations for cost adjustments dcaa questioned certain aspects of madisons direct and incremental costs in response madison provided detailed clarifications of all questioned costs and made significant downward adjustments to its cost proposal including the areas of labor and material overhead and ga rates with each round of discussions and revised proposals madison furnished an updated cost summary along with reconciliation data for all cost adjustments at the time bafos were submitted the seb again reviewed madisons cost proposals based on a comparison of proposed direct labor rates with published surveys of corresponding average prevailing labor rates for the geographical area in question the seb concluded that madisons proposed labor rates were reasonable based on questions by the technical evaluator the seb also adjusted madisons proposed labor rates for the incumbent employees and as appropriate adjusted related costs such as fee based on the labor rate adjustment the seb noted that madison and its subcontractors accepted all of the dcaa recommendations and had proposed labor ga and material overhead and burden rate ceilings all of which were incorporated as special provisions in madisons model contract it is plain from the foregoing that dcaas audit information simply formed a part of nasas cost analysis and that it was nasas analysis not dcaas that resulted in nasas conclusions regarding cost realism the role that dcaas advice played here was entirely proper see delta research assocs inc b nov    cpd para  we also find that nasas cost analysis constituted a reasonable and complete evaluation of madisons cost proposal and resulted in a realistic estimate of its probable cost this is a levelofeffort contract in which the rfp set the number of hours and annual escalation percentage materials costs and relocation estimates thus the agencys primary inquiry was reasonably focused on the accuracy and reasonableness of labor rates erc envtl and energy servs co inc supra to this end the agency ensured that madisons labor rates were consistent with prevailing rates had madison make adjustments based on nasa and dcaa recommendations and adjusted madisons costs to account for the proper incumbent labor rates although the protester argues that nasa should have adjusted madisons costs upward to account for madisons inferior proposal the protester fails to identify any inferior approach which would warrant an adjustment or to specify any costs which should be adjusted under the circumstances we have no basis to conclude that there was any aspect of madisons technical proposal which required nasa to adjust madisons costs upward in a related argument warnerosborn contends that the agency failed to follow certain provisions of the nasa source evaluation board handbook nasa federal acquisition regulation supplement  cfr sec  appendix i hereinafter handbook for example because costs may be significant in indicating an offerors understanding of the human and material resources required for contract performance technical personnel may be given access to the cost proposals handbook sec  a in addition evaluators are to consider proposal risk and discuss it in the seb report handbook sec f  when the seb report is prepared and presented to the sso it should discuss the effects of proposed cost on the management and technical effort and the final cost evaluation chart should include the evaluators confidence in the costs reflected there handbook app c ii sec cbe since these items are not specifically recorded in the seb report the protester argues that the cost evaluation was flawed we disagree first the technical evaluators did review the cost proposals from their review they raised concerns about proposed total compensation plans identified a labor rate concern with all proposals in the competitive range and questioned the direct costs of some offerors second with regard to risk the agency explains that based on madisons very good mission suitability rating and score as well as its high rating on the remaining factors there never was any question about its technical competence to perform while there is no specific reference to risk in the seb report the evaluators identified the various strengths and weaknesses of the offerors proposals including madisons proposal in view of the agencys assessment that madisons lowerscored proposal provided no indication of technical inability and the agencys satisfaction with its probable cost the record makes it clear that the evaluators did not perceive any significant risk associated with madisons proposal third with regard to discussion of these matters in the report to the sso since there was no apparent negative technical impact on cost we fail to see how the evaluators decision not to advise the sso of the absence of technical risk and the lack of any cost impact had any meaningful consequence here since the absence of that information obviously had no effect on the award decision or otherwise prejudiced warnerosborn in the absence of prejudice we will not disturb a contract award american mutual protective bureau inc b jan    cpd para  the costtechnical tradeoff warnerosborn next contends that nasas award decision is flawed because nasa ignored the technical superiority of the warnerosborn proposal and effectively made the award on the basis of low cost and technical acceptability to the extent nasa made a costtechnical tradeoff warnerosborn argues that the agency failed to properly document its award decision in a negotiated procurement agency selection officials have broad discretion in determining the manner and extent to which they will make use of the technical and cost evaluation results costtechnical tradeoffs may be made the extent to which one may be sacrificed for the other is governed by the test of rationality and consistency with the established evaluation factors general servs engg inc b jan    cpd para  an agency may award to an offeror with a lowercost lowerscored proposal if it determines that the cost premium involved in awarding to a higherrated higherpriced offeror is not justified dayton t brown inc b mar    cpd para  while the selection officials judgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show it is not arbitrary kms fusion inc b may    cpd para  an ssos failure to specifically discuss the costtechnical tradeoff in the selection decision document does not affect the validity of the decision if the record shows that the agency reasonably determined that a higher technically scored proposal is not worth the additional cost associated with that proposal mcshade govt contracting servs b feb    cpd para  the rfp provided that award would be made to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous to the government considering cost and other factors here mission suitability relevant experiencepast performance and other considerations financial condition sow exceptions etc the sso determined that the technical advantage of warner osborns proposal did not justify its relatively higher cost the agency states that prior to making this determination there was considerable discussion at the source selection presentation regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the offerors the point differential in the mission suitability scores the cost differential among the offerors and whether it was to the governments advantage to select a higherscored higherpriced offeror the record supports the ssos tradeoff decision although warnerosborns proposals mission suitability score was higher than madisons madisons technical proposal was better than average with regard to mission suitability warnerosborns proposal was viewed as containing  major strengths  minor strengths and no weaknesses and was rated overall excellent madisons proposal was seen as having four major strengths five minor strengths two minor weaknesses and was rated overall very good while the protesters proposal score was higher than madisons in most subfactors madisons proposal score was higher on the approach to sample problems subfactor which was the highest weighted subfactor  points the protester emphasizes its higher mission suitability score however mission suitability and cost were approximately equal in value madisons proposal with most probable costs of  to  million less than the protesters represented a significant cost advantage over warner osborns in the next most important factor relevant experience madisons excellent rating was greater than warnerosborns very good rating in the least important factor other considerations warnerosborn generally had better ratings the record shows that the sso considered mission suitability and cost approximately equal in weight took into consideration madisons excellent relevant experience rating and acceptable ratings for other considerations and carefully weighed whether selection of a higherscored proposal would result in sufficient added value to the government to justify the payment of a substantial price premium in our view since neither proposal represented a clear advantage over the other under the two most important evaluation factors and madison was rated higher in the next most important factor the record supports the ssos tradeoff determination see mcshade govt contracting servs supra kms fusion supra the protest is denied  the rfp provided that the amount of the award fee should be sufficient to motivate the offeror towards the attainment of superior performance with respect to quality of technical performance management of cost and timeliness of deliverables  the first subfactor was scored in two separate elements overall comprehension  points and approach to problems  points while the other subfactors were evaluated on the basis of various elements these were not separately scored  the rfp required offerors to include  incumbent employees in their proposals  warnerosborn also notes that dcaa qualified its audit of madison based on its lack of technical information regarding proposed employees and labor rates however dcaa also concluded that madisons proposal was acceptable as a basis for negotiating a fair and reasonable price in the absence of any evidence that madisons labor rates are inaccurate the dcaa qualification does not adversely impact the agencys cost realism analysis  while viewed in whole the record supports the selection officials judgment we believe the better practice here would have been to document the considerable discussion of strengths weaknesses point and cost differentials and ultimately the specific rationale for the costtechnical tradeoff see kms fusion inc supra excellent was defined as a comprehensive and thorough proposal of exceptional merit with one or more major strengths very good was defined as a proposal which demonstrates overall competence one or more major strengths have been found and strengths outbalance any weaknesses that exist find recent legal decisions  » explore related legal resources  »
