fanfare medium solo music description description capriciously virtuoso sparkling but nevertheless also restful in short “capriccio” this work exists of three succeeding parts which form together one expressive fluent musical story  after a triumphant opening we get acquainted with the floating strength of the bass trombone as a head role player  the other players a six piece trombone ensemble ensure extra thrust  the virtuoso and technical approach of the soloist is noticed immediately  the thrust is scaled back and the technical virtuosity makes place for the warm and romantic side of the bass trombone  in a  meter we start dreaming with a sultry accompaniment  towards the end we get in higher environments both melodically and dynamically  the cadenza acts as a bridge to the last part  the head role player returns sobered up to the roots  the driving beginning topic now develops to a climax in which the soloist in a spectacular manner can give the best of himself capriccio was written especially for ben van dijk bass trombonist of the rotterdam philharmonic orchestra and was premiered in november  at the kentucky university trombone day audio
