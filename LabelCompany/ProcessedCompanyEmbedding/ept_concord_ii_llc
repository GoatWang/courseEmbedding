plaintiffsappellants are seven entities who are collectively attempting to develop a casinoresort complex in the catskills region of new york state defendantsappellees are three groups of investors and business owners with an interest in the casino industry and horse racing in the catskills who the plaintiffs claim entered into an anticompetitive scheme to obstruct the plaintiffs resort development project underlying this antitrust dispute is a threshold question that is ultimately dispositive of this appeal for the purposes of an antitrust claim whether the plaintiffs have alleged a plausible relevant geographic market for their casinorelated products and services facts and procedural history the facts of this case which we view in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs are set out in the district courts order and opinion in detail and are briefly summarized as follows the plaintiffs including concord associates lp concord associates concord raceway corporation concord kiamesha capital corporation concord resort llc concord resort concord kiamesha llc and concord kiamesha hotel llc are collectively attempting to develop a casino gambling resort and race track known as the new concord casino resort at the site of the former concord resort hotel located in the catskills mountains in thompson new york the defendants including entertainment properties trust ept concord llc and ept concord ii llc collectively ept empire resorts inc and monticello raceway management inc collectively empire kien huat realty iii limited kien huat realty genting new york llc and john doe entities  collectively genting or genting defendants are real estate developers and casino and gambling facility operators the plaintiffs intend to develop racing and casino gambling facilities known as racinos on two adjoining properties including  acres at the site of the concord resort hotel which was once a worldfamous vacation destination for visitors to the catskills mountains until its closing and bankruptcy in  and also  acres of adjacent land containing golf courses residential properties and vacant land in  plaintiff concord associates purchased these land parcels from the concord resort hotel bankruptcy estate in furtherance of their development efforts the plaintiffs have conducted an environmental review obtained necessary preliminary licensing approvals and development permits and performed substantial work at the construction site in june  as part of a legal settlement intended to resolve several lawsuits between defendant ept and plaintiff concord associates the plaintiffs transferred the  acre parcel to defendant ept concord ii under the settlement the plaintiffs retained the right for exclusive use and exploitation of the property including the right to develop the proposed resort accordingly concord associates entered into an agreement with ept concord ii that specifically reserved the right for the plaintiffs to lease a tract for a racino on the property along with additional easements leases and other rights related to development of the property in addition the terms included a restrictive covenant pursuant to which ept concord ii agreed that its successors or assignees would not own or operate any competing casino racino racing or gaming facility on the property in addition to entering the agreement with ept concord ii the plaintiffs entered into a contractual relationship with empire to further the development of their resort since  empire had owned and operated the monticello raceway located approximately four miles from the plaintiffs proposed resort in  the monticello raceway began offering casino gaming and since that time it has been the only race track or casino in the catskills the closest racinos are eighty miles away in pennsylvania and  miles away in yonkers monticello raceway also claims that it does not compete directly with other harness racing tracks in new york state for live racing patrons am compl ¶  thus according to the plaintiffs empires position as the sole operator of casino gaming in the catskills makes it the only game in town for local consumers and tourists am compl ¶  empire was initially supportive of the plaintiffs proposed resort and in march  it entered into an agreement with concord associates to provide management services at the plaintiffs proposed raceway but in november  defendant kien huat realty—which together with other genting defendants makes up one of the worlds largest gaming conglomerates—acquired a majority interest in empire according to plaintiffs kien huat realty has since worked to undermine plaintiffs resort project shortly after november  empire ceased cooperating with the plaintiffs and opened a rival racino in collaboration with genting at the site of the aqueduct race track approximately  miles from the site of the plaintiffs proposed resort in addition in april  ept and empire entered into an exclusive agreement to develop their own racino project adjacent to the plaintiffs proposed resort and repudiated the lease and restrictive covenants promised to concord associates the plaintiffs claim that genting ept and empire are all members of an anticompetitive scheme to undermine the plaintiffs resort development project after bringing actions for breach of contract in the new york state court without success the plaintiffs commenced this federal antitrust action on march   in response to the defendants motions to dismiss the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint the amended complaint that purported to define the relevant geographic market for the products the plaintiffs resort would have to offer as pleaded that relevant market includes the area within a radius of approximately  miles from the town of thompson with a total population of more than  million people of whom almost ninety percent reside in the new york city metropolitan area ny metro area in response to the amended complaint the defendants moved to dismiss it on the basis that the plaintiffs had not defined a plausible geographic market ultimately the district court granted the motions to dismiss as to all defendants without considering the additional materials the plaintiffs submitted or a proposed second amended complaint see concord assocs lp v entmt props tr et al no   wl  at  sdny apr   further the court dismissed the plaintiffs state law claims declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under  usc § c id the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration which the district court denied reasoning that it could not consider materials not presented as part of the amended complaint and that in any event the plaintiffs additional arguments failed to rectify their fatally flawed market definitions see concord assocs lp v entmt props tr no   wl  at  sdny nov   on appeal the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in deciding that the amended complaint failed to allege a plausible relevant geographic market and that the factual allegations were insufficient to connect certain of the defendants to the alleged conspiracy the plaintiffs also claim the district court erred in denying them leave to amend the amended complaint because we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs proposed market definition is inherently implausible we find that the plaintiffs failed to allege adequate facts to state a violation of the sherman act therefore we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint analysis this court reviews de novo a district courts dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b construing the complaint liberally accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs

ashcroft v iqbal  us    sct   ledd   quoting bell atl corp v twombly  us    sct   ledd   a claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged meaning that there is more than a sheer possibility that a defendant acted unlawfully id citing twombly  us at   sct  at the same time there is no heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases and the facts alleged are subject to federal rule of civil procedure as general requirement of a short plain statement of facts supporting a plausible claim todd v exxon corp  fd   d cir the plaintiffs brought claims under sections one and two of the sherman act section one of the sherman act declares illegal every

and  allege conduct in violation of antitrust laws new york medscan llc v ny univ sch of med  fsuppd   sdny in such actions the relevant market is the area of effective competition within which the defendant operates adsat div of skylight inc v assoc press  fd   d cir quoting tampa electric co v nashville coal co  us    sct   ledd   that is a market consists of an area where sellers if unified by a hypothetical cartel or merger could profitably raise prices significantly above the competitive level id at  for antitrust purposes the concept of a market has two components a product market and a geographic market bayer schering pharma ag v sandoz inc  fsuppd   sdny  a relevant product market consists of products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are produced—price use and qualities considered pepsico inc v cocacola co  fd   d cir per curiam quoting united states v ei du pont de nemours  co  us    sct   led   by contrast the geographic market analysis seeks to identify the precise geographic boundaries of effective competition in order to reach a more informed conclusion on potential harm to the market mathias v daily news lp  fsuppd   sdny courts generally measure a markets geographic scope the area of effective competition by determining the areas in which the seller operates and where consumers can turn as a practical matter for supply of the relevant product heerwagen v clear channel commcns  fd   d cir citation omitted overruled on other grounds by teamsters local  freight div pension fund v bombardier inc  fd   d cir taken together the product and geographic components illuminate the relevant market analysis which is essential for assessing the potential harm to competition from the defendants alleged misconduct mathias

lessen or destroy competition xerox corp v media sciences intl inc  fsuppd   sdny quoting walker process equip inc v food mach  chem corp  us    sct   ledd   internal alterations omitted although market definition is a deeply factintensive inquiry not ordinarily subject to dismissal at the pleadings stage todd  fd at  there is no absolute rule against dismissal where the plaintiff has failed to articulate a plausible explanation as to why a market should be limited in a particular way id at  thus in order to survive a motion to dismiss it is appropriate for a district court to assess whether the plaintiffs complaint asserts sufficient facts to allege plausibly the existence of both a product and geographic market id the district court determined that the plaintiffs antitrust claims were subject to dismissal because the plaintiffs had failed to plead a plausible relevant racinggaming market in the catskills region concord assocs  wl  at   it found the plaintiffs proposed geographic market too narrow and inherently implausible id at  we agree the plaintiffs have provided no basis on which to justify their proposed geographic market definition although they define the relevant market as the racinggaming market in the catskills region appellants br  an area consisting of primarily four counties they also assert that the resort would draw customers from a catchment area consisting of twentythree counties in new york northeastern new jersey and pennsylvania with a total population of more than  million people concord assocs  wl  at  conveniently for the plaintiffs this proposed market definition excludes gambling markets in connecticut pennsylvania and new jersey that are wellknown and accessible to residents of the ny metro area we find unpersuasive the plaintiffs claim that the bulk of the resorts potential customers would not view atlantic city and connecticut as reasonably interchangeable substitutes for a catskills racino in terms of distance as well as regional character appellants br  although facilities in the latter locations are approximately  miles from the ny metro area rather than  miles the plaintiffs fail to present a plausible basis for explaining why an additional twentyfive miles makes the difference these locations are reasonably accessible by car to ny metro area residents and as the plaintiffs concede these other facilities provide amenities comparable to the plaintiffs proposed resort as for the regional character of the catskills the plaintiffs argue that the catskills region comprises a unique geographic market for a racino and hotel complex based on its status as a tourist destination with popular natural resources for water sports mountain sports hunting and golf am compl ¶  however merely asserting that a commodity is in some way unique is insufficient to plead a relevant market rather an antitrust complaint must explain why the market it alleges is the relevant economically significant product market bv optische industrie de oude delft v hologic inc  fsupp   sdny we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged why their proposed resort differs from the variety of other options for tourists to combine a gambling trip access to natural resources and other related activities available more or less the same distance from the ny metro area as thompson new york see eg smugglers notch homeowners assoc inc v smugglers notch mmgt co ltd  civ   wl  dvt may   affirmed  fedappx  d cir holding that antitrust plaintiffs had not shown why their vacation properties and recreation facilities    are different from the myriad other options at ski resorts in vermont we agree with the defendants argument that various locations around new york city could also be thought of as tourist destinations where tourists could gamble and have access to natural resources and other related activities the plaintiffs compare their proposed geographic market to the aspen skiing market and the atlantic city gambling market both of which have been implicitly recognized as valid market definitions in antitrust suits see aspen skiing co v aspen highlands skiing corp  us    sct   ledd   mirage resorts inc v trump no  civ dab  wl  at  sdny dec   but the plaintiffs in those cases contended that the markets were highly localized as tourists specifically came to aspen and atlantic city and then considered only product options within those destination locations for skiing and gambling respectively see aspen skiing co  us at   sct  describing aspen as a destination market and detailing dispute among ski resorts within aspen mirage resorts inc  wl  at  stating plaintiffs claim that defendant had suppressed competition in the atlantic city gaming market furthermore the market definitions in aspen skiing and mirage resorts were not subject to challenge and the validity of those market definitions was therefore not at issue see aspen skiing co  us at   sct  explaining that primary issue before jury was whether defendant had monopolized the market mirage resorts inc  wl  at  stating that defendants arguments for dismissal included plaintiffs failure to allege anticompetitive activities elements of a conspiracy or injury to competition while plaintiffs argue that some gambling markets are uniquely localized relying on in the matter of pinnacle entertainment inc no   wl  at  ftc may   the mere fact that certain gambling markets may be localized does not relieve the plaintiffs of the requirement to show why the catskills gambling market is a localized or regional market—particularly where the vast majority of customers are not local and have a myriad of other comparable options moreover as the district court noted by arbitrarily excising those alternative options and essentially arguing that there are no comparable competitors plaintiffs exempt themselves from the requirement of defining the market according to the rules of interchangeability and crosselasticity concord assocs  wl  at  in so doing the plaintiffs further undermine the plausibility of their antitrust claims see bv optische industrie de oude delft  fsupp at  because a relevant market includes all products which are reasonably interchangeable   the plaintiffs failure to define the market by reference to the rule of reasonable interchangeability is standing alone valid grounds for dismissal internal quotation and citation omitted because plaintiffs failed to plead a relevant geographic market in the amended complaint the district court correctly concluded that each of the sherman act claims was subject to dismissal finally we address the plaintiffs argument that the district court erred by not granting them leave to file a second amended complaint we review for abuse of discretion a district courts decision to deny a party leave to amend a complaint grochowski v phoenix const  fd   d cir the plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously determined that the plaintiffs had withdrawn their request for leave to amend the amended complaint see concord associates  wl  at  we need not decide this question however because granting leave to file a second amended complaint would have been futile see nielsen v rabin  fd   d cir although the plaintiffs proposed second amended complaint alleges two relevant markets—a catskills racinggaming market ¶  and a downstate new york racinggaming market ¶ —rather than one market these proposed markets refer to the same geographic area as the market alleged in the amended complaint this recharacterization fails to remedy the flaws in the plaintiffs proposed geographic market definition conclusion we hold that the plaintiffs pleadings fail to define a plausible relevant geographic or product market for antitrust purposes and that the district court properly dismissed their sherman act claims the judgment of the district court is affirmed footnotes  see concord assocs lp v ept concord llc no  nysupct sullivan cnty june    the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in failing to consider extrinsic materials they submitted in opposition to the defendants motions to dismiss including several exhibits and securities  exchange disclosures the plaintiffs claim that these documents show that genting conspired to exclude market competition in violation of antitrust laws we need not address the substance of the plaintiffs arguments because our decision is based on the plaintiffs failure to allege a plausible relevant market in which competition could be restrained in any event the district court correctly declined to consider the extrinsic materials as they were not incorporated by reference or otherwise integral to the complaint see allen v westpointpepperell inc  fd   d cir stating that in adjudicating rule b motion district court must confine its consideration to facts stated on the face of the complaint in documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference and to matters of which judicial notice may be taken further even if the documents were properly the subject of judicial notice judicial notice would not be appropriate because the plaintiffs did not rely on the documents in drafting the complaint chambers v time warner inc  fd   d cir  in this appeal the plaintiffs have not specifically challenged the district courts dismissal of their state law claims and we therefore consider any such challenge to be waived see jp morgan chase bank v altos hornos de mexico sa de cv  fd   d cir  because we affirm the district court on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege a plausible geographic market we do not decide whether the plaintiffs also failed to allege an antitrust violation or an antitrust injury  as an initial matter the plaintiffs claim to have alleged that the defendants committed a per se violation of section  of the sherman act by engaging in a group boycott and a refusal to deal which relieves the plaintiffs from the requirement of demonstrating a marketwide anticompetitive effect a per se violation involves conduct so plainly harmful to competition and so obviously lacking in any redeeming procompetitive values that it is conclusively presumed illegal without further examination capital imaging assocs pc v mohawk valley med assocs

casinoresort complex in the catskills region of new york state defendants–appellees are three groups of investors and business owners with an interest in the casino industry and horse racing in the catskills who the plaintiffs claim entered into an anticompetitive scheme to obstruct the plaintiffs resort development project underlying this antitrust dispute is a threshold question that is ultimately dispositive of this appeal for the purposes of an antitrust claim whether the plaintiffs have alleged a plausible relevant geographic market for their casinorelated products and servicesfacts and procedural historythe facts of this case which we view in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs are set out in the district courts order and opinion in detail and are briefly summarized as follows the plaintiffs including concord associates lp “concord associates” concord raceway corporation concord kiamesha capital corporation concord resort llc “concord resort” concord kiamesha llc and concord kiamesha hotel llc are collectively attempting to develop a casino gambling resort and race track known as the new concord casino resort at the site of the former concord resort hotel located in the catskills mountains in thompson new york the defendants including entertainment properties trust ept concord llc and ept concord ii llc collectively “ept” empire resorts inc and monticello raceway management inc collectively “empire” kien huat realty iii limited “kien huat realty” genting new york llc and john doe entities – collectively “genting” or “genting defendants” are real estate developers and casino and gambling facility operatorsthe plaintiffs intend to develop racing and casino gambling facilities known as “racinos” on two adjoining properties including  acres at the site of the concord resort hotel which was once a worldfamous vacation destination for visitors to the catskills mountains until its closing and bankruptcy in  and also  acres of adjacent land containing golf courses residential properties and vacant land in  plaintiff concord associates purchased these land parcels from the concord resort hotel bankruptcy estate in furtherance of their development efforts the plaintiffs have conducted an environmental review obtained necessary preliminary licensing approvals and development permits and performed substantial work at the construction sitein june  as part of a legal settlement intended to resolve several lawsuits between defendant ept and plaintiff concord associates the plaintiffs transferred the  acre parcel to defendant ept concord ii under the settlement the plaintiffs retained the right for exclusive use and exploitation of the property including the right to develop the proposed resort accordingly concord associates entered into an agreement with ept concord ii that specifically reserved the right for the plaintiffs to lease a tract for a “racino” on the property along with additional easements leases and other rights related to development of the property in addition the terms included a restrictive covenant pursuant to which ept concord ii agreed that its successors or assignees would not own or operate any competing casino racino racing or gaming facility on the propertyin addition to entering the agreement with ept concord ii the plaintiffs entered into a contractual relationship with empire to further the development of their resort since  empire had owned and operated the monticello raceway located approximately four miles from the plaintiffs proposed resort in  the monticello raceway began offering casino gaming and since that time it has been the only race track or casino in the catskills the closest racinos are eighty miles away in pennsylvania and  miles away in yonkers monticello raceway also claims that it “does not compete directly with other harness racing tracks in new york state for live racing patrons” am compl ¶  thus according to the plaintiffs empires position as the sole operator of casino gaming in the catskills makes it “the only game in town” for local consumers and tourists am compl ¶ empire was initially supportive of the plaintiffs proposed resort and in march  it entered into an agreement with concord associates to provide management services at the plaintiffs proposed raceway but in november  defendant kien huat realty—which together with other genting defendants makes up one of the worlds largest gaming conglomerates—acquired a majority interest in empire according to plaintiffs kien huat realty has since worked to undermine plaintiffs resort project shortly after november  empire ceased cooperating with the plaintiffs and opened a rival “racino” in collaboration with genting at the site of the aqueduct race track approximately  miles from the site of the plaintiffs proposed resort in addition in april  ept and empire entered into an exclusive agreement to develop their own “racino” project adjacent to the plaintiffs proposed resort and repudiated the lease and restrictive covenants promised to concord associates the plaintiffs claim that genting ept and empire are all members of an anticompetitive scheme to undermine the plaintiffs resort development projectafter bringing actions for breach of contract in the new york state court without success the plaintiffs commenced this federal antitrust action on march   in response to the defendants motions to dismiss the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint the “amended complaint” that purported to define the relevant geographic market for the products the plaintiffs resort would have to offer as pleaded that relevant market includes the area within a radius of approximately  miles from the town of thompson with a total population of more than – million people of whom almost ninety percent reside in the new york city metropolitan area “ny metro area” in response to the amended complaint the defendants moved to dismiss it on the basis that the plaintiffs had not defined a plausible geographic market ultimately the district court granted the motions to dismiss as to all defendants without considering the additional materials the plaintiffs submitted or a proposed second amended complaint see concord assocs lp v entmt props tr et al no –  wl  at  sdny apr   further the court dismissed the plaintiffs state law claims declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under  usc § c id the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration which the district court denied reasoning that it could not consider materials not presented as part of the amended complaint and that in any event the plaintiffs additional arguments failed to rectify their fatally flawed market definitions see concord assocs lp v entmt props tr no –  wl  at – sdny nov  on appeal the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in deciding that the amended complaint failed to allege a plausible relevant geographic market and that the factual allegations were insufficient to connect certain of the defendants to the alleged conspiracy the plaintiffs also claim the district court erred in denying them leave to amend the amended complaint because we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs proposed market definition is inherently implausible we find that the plaintiffs failed to allege adequate facts to state a violation of the sherman act therefore we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the complaintanalysisthis court “reviews de novo a district courts dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b construing the complaint liberally accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor ” chambers v time warner inc  fd   d cir“to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter accepted as true to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face’ “ ashcroft v iqbal  us    quoting bell atl corp v twombly  us    a claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged” meaning that there is “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant acted unlawfully” id citing twombly  us at – at the same time there is no heightened pleading standard in antitrust cases and the facts alleged are subject to federal rule of civil procedure as general requirement of a “short plain statement” of facts supporting a plausible claim todd v exxon corp  fd   d cirthe plaintiffs brought claims under sections one and two of the sherman act section one of the sherman act declares illegal “every contract combination ․ or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce․”  usc §  section two of the sherman act makes it illegal “to monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire ․ to monopolize ․ trade or commerce․”  usc §  section four of the clayton act provides a private right of action with a recovery of treble damages to “any person who has been injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws․”  usc § ato survive a motion to dismiss a sherman act claim must “ define the relevant geographic market  allege an antitrust injury and  allege conduct in violation of antitrust laws” new york medscan llc v ny univ sch of med  fsuppd   sdny in such actions the relevant market is the “ ‘area of effective competition’ within which the defendant operates” adsat div of skylight inc v assoc press  fd   d cir quoting tampa electric co v nashville coal co  us  –  that is a market consists of an area where sellers “if unified by a hypothetical cartel or merger could profitably raise prices significantly above the competitive level” id at for antitrust purposes the concept of a market has two components a product market and a geographic market bayer schering pharma ag v sandoz inc  fsuppd   sdny  “a relevant product market consists of ‘products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are produced—price use and qualities considered’ “ pepsico inc v coca–cola co  fd   d cir per curiam quoting united states v ei du pont de nemours  co  us    by contrast “the geographic market analysis seeks to identify the precise geographic boundaries of effective competition in order to reach a more informed conclusion on potential harm to the market” mathias v daily news lp  fsuppd   sdny “courts generally measure a markets geographic scope the ‘area of effective competition’ by determining the areas in which the seller operates and where consumers can turn as a practical matter for supply of the relevant product” heerwagen v clear channel commcns  fd   d cir citation omitted overruled on other grounds by teamsters local  freight div pension fund v bombardier inc  fd   d cir“taken together the product and geographic components illuminate the relevant market analysis which is essential for assessing the potential harm to competition from the defendants alleged misconduct” mathias  fsuppd at  and this analysis is equally applicable to claims made under section two of the sherman act because “without a definition of that market there is no way to measure the defendants ability to lessen or destroy competition” xerox corp v media sciences intl inc  fsuppd   sdny quoting walker process equip inc v food mach  chem corp  us    internal alterations omittedalthough market definition is a “deeply factintensive inquiry” not ordinarily subject to dismissal at the pleadings stage todd  fd at  there is “no absolute rule” against dismissal where the plaintiff has failed to articulate a plausible explanation as to why a market should be limited in a particular way id at  thus in order to survive a motion to dismiss it is appropriate for a district court to assess whether the plaintiffs complaint asserts sufficient facts to allege plausibly the existence of both a product and geographic market idthe district court determined that the plaintiffs antitrust claims were subject to dismissal because the plaintiffs had failed to plead a plausible relevant racinggaming market in the catskills region concord assocs  wl  at   – it found the plaintiffs proposed geographic market “too narrow and inherently implausible” id at  we agreethe plaintiffs have provided no basis on which to justify their proposed geographic market definition although they define the relevant market as “the racinggaming market in the catskills region” appellants br  an area consisting of primarily four counties they also assert that the resort would draw customers from a “catchment area” consisting of twentythree counties in new york northeastern new jersey and pennsylvania with a total population of more than – million people concord assocs  wl  at  conveniently for the plaintiffs this proposed market definition excludes gambling markets in connecticut pennsylvania and new jersey that are wellknown and accessible to residents of the ny metro area we find unpersuasive the plaintiffs claim that the bulk of the resorts potential customers would not view atlantic city and connecticut as “reasonably interchangeable substitutes for a catskills racino in terms of distance as well as regional character” appellants br  although facilities in the latter locations are approximately  miles from the ny metro area rather than  miles the plaintiffs fail to present a plausible basis for explaining why an additional twentyfive miles makes the difference these locations are reasonably accessible by car to ny metro area residents and as the plaintiffs concede these other facilities provide amenities comparable to the plaintiffs proposed resortas for the “regional character” of the catskills the plaintiffs argue that the catskills region comprises a “unique” geographic market for a “racino” and hotel complex based on its status as a tourist destination with “popular natural resources for water sports mountain sports hunting and golf” am compl ¶  however “merely asserting that a commodity is in some way unique is insufficient to plead a relevant market rather an antitrust complaint must explain why the market it alleges is the relevant economically significant product market” bv optische industrie de oude delft v hologic inc  fsupp   sdny we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged why their proposed resort differs from the variety of other options for tourists to combine a gambling trip access to natural resources and other related activities available more or less the same distance from the ny metro area as thompson new york see eg smugglers notch homeowners assoc inc v smugglers notch mmgt co ltd  civ   wl  dvt may   affirmed  f appx  d cir holding that antitrust plaintiffs had not shown why their “vacation properties and recreation facilities ․ are different from the myriad other options at ski resorts in vermont” we agree with the defendants argument that various locations around new york city could also be thought of as tourist destinations where tourists could gamble and have access to natural resources and other related activitiesthe plaintiffs compare their proposed geographic market to the aspen skiing market and the atlantic city gambling market both of which have been implicitly recognized as valid market definitions in antitrust suits see aspen skiing co v aspen highlands skiing corp  us  –  mirage resorts inc v trump no  civ dab  wl  at  sdny dec   but the plaintiffs in those cases contended that the markets were highly localized as tourists specifically came to aspen and atlantic city and then considered only product options within those destination locations for skiing and gambling respectively see aspen skiing co  us at  describing aspen as a “destination” market and detailing dispute among ski resorts within aspen mirage resorts inc  wl  at  stating plaintiffs claim that defendant had “suppress ed competition in the atlantic city gaming market” furthermore the market definitions in aspen skiing and mirage resorts were not subject to challenge and the validity of those market definitions was therefore not at issue see aspen skiing co  us at – explaining that primary issue before jury was whether defendant had monopolized the market mirage resorts inc  wl  at  stating that defendants arguments for dismissal included plaintiffs failure to allege anticompetitive activities elements of a conspiracy or injury to competitionwhile plaintiffs argue that some gambling markets are uniquely localized relying on in the matter of pinnacle entertainment inc  no   wl  at – ftc may   the mere fact that certain gambling markets may be localized does not relieve the plaintiffs of the requirement to show why the catskills gambling market is a localized or regional marketparticularly where the vast majority of customers are not local and have a myriad of other comparable optionsmoreover as the district court noted “by arbitrarily excising those alternative options and essentially arguing that there are no comparable competitors plaintiffs exempt themselves from the requirement of defining the market according to the rules of interchangeability and crosselasticity” concord assocs  wl  at  in so doing the plaintiffs further undermine the plausibility of their antitrust claims see bv optische industrie de oude delft  fsupp at – “because a relevant market includes all products which are reasonably interchangeable ․ the plaintiffs failure to define the market by reference to the rule of reasonable interchangeability is standing alone valid grounds for dismissal” internal quotation and citation omittedbecause plaintiffs failed to plead a relevant geographic market in the amended complaint the district court correctly concluded that each of the sherman act claims was subject to dismissalfinally we address the plaintiffs argument that the district court erred by not granting them leave to file a second amended complaint we review for abuse of discretion a district courts decision to deny a party leave to amend a complaint grochowski v phoenix const  fd   d cir the plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously determined that the plaintiffs had withdrawn their request for leave to amend the amended complaint see concord associates  wl  at  we need not decide this question however because granting leave to file a second amended complaint would have been futile see nielsen v rabin  fd   d cir although the plaintiffs proposed second amended complaint alleges two relevant markets—a “catskills racinggaming market” ¶  and a “downstate new york racinggaming market” ¶ —rather than one market these proposed markets refer to the same geographic area as the market alleged in the amended complaint this recharacterization fails to remedy the flaws in the plaintiffs proposed geographic market definitionconclusionwe hold that the plaintiffs pleadings fail to define a plausible relevant geographic or product market for antitrust purposes and that the district court properly dismissed their sherman act claims the judgment of the district court is affirmedfootnotes  see concord assocs lp v ept concord llc no – ny supct sullivan cnty june    the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in failing to consider extrinsic materials they submitted in opposition to the defendants motions to dismiss including several exhibits and securities  exchange disclosures the plaintiffs claim that these documents show that genting conspired to exclude market competition in violation of antitrust laws we need not address the substance of the plaintiffs arguments because our decision is based on the plaintiffs failure to allege a plausible relevant market in which competition could be restrained in any event the district court correctly declined to consider the extrinsic materials as they were not incorporated by reference or otherwise integral to the complaint see allen v westpoint–pepperell inc  fd   d cir stating that in adjudicating rule b motion district court must confine its consideration “to facts stated on the face of the complaint in documents appended to the complaint or incorporated in the complaint by reference and to matters of which judicial notice may be taken” further even if the documents were properly the subject of judicial notice judicial notice would not be appropriate because the plaintiffs did not rely on the documents in drafting the complaint chambers v time warner inc   fd   d cir  in this appeal the plaintiffs have not specifically challenged the district courts dismissal of their state law claims and we therefore consider any such challenge to be waived see jp morgan chase bank v altos hornos de mexico sa de cv  fd   d cir  because we affirm the district court on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege a plausible geographic market we do not decide whether the plaintiffs also failed to allege an antitrust violation or an antitrust injury  as an initial matter the plaintiffs claim to have alleged that the defendants committed a per se violation of section  of the sherman act by engaging in “a group boycott” and a “refusal to deal” which relieves the plaintiffs from the requirement of demonstrating a marketwide anticompetitive effect a per se violation involves conduct “so plainly harmful to competition and so obviously lacking in any redeeming procompetitive values that it is ‘conclusively presumed illegal without further examination’ “ capital imaging assocs pc v mohawk valley med assocs inc  fd   d cir quoting broadcast music inc v cbs
