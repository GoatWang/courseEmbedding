l lópez justice sandee bryan marion justice opinion by alma l lópez justice appellant eog resources inc eog appeals from the trial courts judgment after a nonjury trial on appeal eog contends the evidence was legally insufficient to support the trial courts findings that hanson production companys hanson overriding royalty interest was defined by the terms of a mineral lease assignment and that this overriding royalty interest was enforceable upon extensions or renewals of the assigned mineral lease we overrule eogs two issues and affirm the judgment of the trial court background this is a dispute surrounding eogs alleged failure to pay hanson overriding royalties pursuant to an assignment which assigned hansons lease interest to eog the essential facts of the case are undisputed by the parties on june   eog sent a letter to hanson offering to acquire hansons leasehold position in six mineral leases located in jefferson county texas the letter provided the general terms of the assignment eog offered to pay  or  per net mineral acre to hanson upon a mutually acceptable form of assignment conveying the interest to eog hanson would deliver a net revenue interest of  reserving the difference between  and any other lease burden ie landowner royalty this reservation constituted the overriding royalty  the letter was signed by steve himes senior landman for eog hanson noted its agreement by signing the letter richard lucas landman signed on behalf of hanson the parties executed an assignment of oil gas and mineral leases the assignment on august   the operative section regarding hansons overriding royalty specifically provides the following assignor hanson reserves unto itself an overriding royalty equal to the difference between the aggregate of the basic royalties overriding royalties and similar burdens chargeable to assignors leases existing on the effective date of this assignment and twentyfive percent  the overriding royalty reserved herein shall burden any extensions or renewals taken within one  year of termination of the subject leases while in draft form eog made revisions to the assignment which were ultimately incorporated into the final draft the most important of these revisions was eogs insertion of a paragraph referencing the june   letter and which came after the paragraph which created hansons overriding royalty interest that paragraph states this assignment of oil gas and mineral leases is subject to that certain unrecorded letter agreement dated june   by and between assignor and assignee no other revisions were made to the assignment by eog prior to eog commencing production two of the six leases expired without hansons participation eog negotiated with the landowners for two new leases where the landowners had previously agreed with hanson for a  royalty interest they only agreed to a  royalty interest with eog after the renewal eog drilled and successfully completed a well in the area the division order sent by eog to hanson reflected a total overriding royalty in an amount less than the overriding royalty based upon the formula established under the assignment on august   by letter hanson informed eog of the discrepancy in a letter dated august   eog informed hanson that the higher royalty demanded by the landowners under the two new leases it had negotiated effectively nullified hansons overriding royalty hanson subsequently filed suit against eog alleging a claim for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment the parties stipulated to the amount of damages owed to hanson based upon the assignment approximately  a bench trial was held both parties agreed the terms of their agreement were not ambiguous on this basis no witnesses were heard and the trial court considered the arguments of counsel and evidence stipulated to by the parties the trial court subsequently entered a final judgment in hansons favor findings of fact and conclusions of law were timely requested by eog and entered by the trial court the trial court specifically found that hansons overriding royalty was based upon the terms of the assignment specifically the trial court found that hansons overriding royalty was fixed and determined on the date the assignment was made the trial court also found that hansons overriding royalty was enforceable on extensions or renewals the court also found that the leases listed in the assignment contained a  landowner royalty  burden effective on the date of the assignment accordingly the overriding royalty reserved by hanson was the difference between  and  or  eog appeals the trial courts judgment standard of review neither eog nor hanson contend the contract in question is ambiguous the interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law and we are not required to defer to any interpretation afforded by the trial court mci telecommunications corp v texas utilities elec co  swd   tex birnbaum v swepi lp  swd   texappsan antonio  pet denied accordingly we review the trial courts construction of an unambiguous contract by a de novo standard analysis an overriding royalty is a benefit an assignor receives when he or she assigns a leasehold interest it is an interest which is carved out of and constitutes part of the working interest created by an oil and gas lease gruss v cummins  swd  texcivappel paso  writ refd nre specifically it is the share of the oil or gas produced reserved in assignment part assignment or sublease of an oil and gas lease payable to the assignor by the assignee over and above the royalty reserved in the lease payable to the lessor see  wl summers the law of oil  gas §  nd ed an overriding royalty is an interest in real property regarded as a covenant running with the land between the assignor and the assignee and is enforceable by the assignor against the assignee phillips petroleum co v taylor  fd   th cir at issue in this case is the scope of hansons overriding royalty interest as defined by the contract between hanson and eog eog contends that the assignment is not determinative of hansons overriding royalty interest rather eog contends the june   letter defines the scope of hansons overriding royalty interest for this reason eog contends that it inserted the subject to language in the assignment by inserting this language it was eogs intent to correct two problems it had with hansons initial draft of the assignment  its failure to expressly state that eog had a  revenue interest and  providing that hansons overriding interest would be effective in the case of renewals or extensions on the leases where a written contract is clear and certain the instrument will be deemed to express the intention of the parties and will be enforced as written no matter what their actual intention may have been lopez v muñoz hockema  reed llp  swd   tex  elliottwilliams co inc v diaz  swd   tex in pursuit of this goal a court examines the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless mci telecommunications corp  swd at  we presume that the parties to a contract intend every clause to have some effect birnbaum  swd at  we enforce an unambiguous contract as written id where the meaning of the contract is plain and unambiguous a partys construction is immaterial ussery inv v canon  carpenter inc  swd   texapphouston st dist  writ dismd finally when two or more instruments make up a single transaction all of them must be construed together as one contract ikon office solutions inc v eifert  swd    texapphouston th dist  no pet in light of these principles contrary to eogs contention the agreement of the parties is embodied in both the letter and the assignment the assignment expressly states that the assignment is subject to the parties letter agreement therefore the plain language of the assignment at a minimum incorporates by reference the june   letter see eland energy inc v rowden oil  gas inc  swd   texappsan antonio  writ denied even if we were to assume that the terms subject to made the assignment subservient to the june   letter agreement eogs argument would fail because the letter is silent on whether hansons overriding royalty would apply to lease extensions or renewals eog relies on this courts opinion in eland energy inc for the proposition that the subject to language in the assignment makes the june   letter determinative of hansons overriding interest in eland energy inc rowden and cox entered into a letter agreement regarding a farmout on the perez lease under that agreement rowden would assign  acres in the form of a square around each producing well cox completed upon the condition that cox would commence drilling within  days and drilled to a specific depth if cox gave notice that he was ready to plug and abandon a well rowden had the right to take over the well an assignment which was subsequently executed assigned rowdens entire interest in the perez lease to cox the assignment however provided that it was subject to the terms and provision of that certain letter agreement  and in particular to the continuous drilling obligation imposed by such agreement id at  eland a subsequent assignee of cox contended that rowden had assigned his entire interest in the perez lease and therefore eland has equitable title in the perez lease the court held the subject to language in the assignment negated this argument the reasoning of the court was that the subject to clause made the acquisition of equitable title dependent upon the continuous drilling obligation as encompassed under the letter agreement by reading the letter agreement and assignment together this court concluded that rowden had reserved equitable title to all lands not affected by producing wells completed by cox id at  the court reached that conclusion on the basis that the subject to language in the assignment specifically referenced the continuous drilling obligation language in the letter agreement that defined coxs interest these facts however are distinguishable from the instant matter contrasting the june   letter is silent on whether or not hansons overriding royalty would apply to lease extensions or renewals given this important factual distinction we are not inclined to hold that the june   letter alone defined hansons overriding royalty interest our conclusion that the parties contract is encompassed in both the june   letter and assignment is further supported by the general rule in oil and gas law that controversies regarding assignors and assignees are governed by the construction and interpretation of the provisions of the assignment itself and the collateral contracts of the parties see  eg sunac petroleum corp v parkes  swd   tex hg sledge inc v the prospective inv  trading co ltd  swd   texappaustin  pet denied phillips v inexco oil co inc  swd   tex civapptyler  writ refd nre looking to assignment and letter agreement to determine rights of assignor and assignee for these reasons we overrule eogs first issue in their second issue eog contends the trial court erred in finding that hansons overriding royalty is enforceable upon any extensions or renewals of mineral leases an overriding interest created by assignment does not survive the termination of the assigned lease unless the instrument creating the overriding interest provides an express provision to the contrary see fain  mcgaha v biesel  swd   texcivappfort worth  writ refd nre here the assignment expressly provides that hansons overriding royalty shall burden any extensions or renewals taken within one  year of termination of the subject leases therefore the express language of the parties agreement indicates hansons overriding royalty interest would apply to extensions and renewals taken within a year if we solely considered the june   letter which is silent on the issue we would be contradicting established contract interpretation principles to examine the entire agreement give effect to every clause and not render any clause meaningless under eogs interpretation the clause providing that hansons overriding interest would burden any extensions or renewals taken within one year would be rendered meaningless we refuse to render a portion of the contract meaningless therefore we overrule eogs second issue conclusion having overruled eogs two issues on appeal we affirm the judgment of the trial court notes  this letter admitted as evidence and considered by the trial court reflected that the landowners royalty interest on the effective date of the assignment was th and that based upon the assignment hanson would receive an overriding royalty equal to the difference between  and  or   subject to as used in conveyances is a term of qualification and not of contract kokernot v caldwell  swd   texcivappdallas  writ refd used in its ordinary sense the term subject to means subservient to or subordinate to or limited by id  eog also relies on hg sledge inc for the proposition that this court should only focus on the june   letter as determinative of the rights of the parties notably in that case there was only one document determinative of the parties rights a farmout agreement in this case we are dealing with the agreement of the parties as encompassed in two documents for this reason we conclude hg sledge inc is dispositive of this case contact us directory  eog resources inc home glossary site search contact us overview letter to stockholders

earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp
