business for the cigar subsidiary is booming and the corporation is repositioning itself to become a major player in not only cigars but in cigarrelated merchandise and upscale products the biggest change has come at the top the companys longtime chief executive officer edgar m cullman sr  turned over the daytoday operations to his son edgar m cullman jr cullman  has been preparing for this job his entire adult life after graduating from yale university in  he went through stints in the army and then manufacturers hanover trust co as a management trainee he joined general cigar co in  and became senior vice president for cigars and tobacco in  and later that year the executive vice president for marketing he became executive vice president and chief operating officer of general cigar in  and was appointed in  to president of the division as well as a member of the board of directors of culbro in 3 he was named executive vice president of culbro and took over as president the following year cullmans rise to the companys top job couldnt have come at a more challenging time but his strategy is simple keep the company at the top of the cigar industry he discussed his plans for culbro and general cigar in a wideranging interview this past june with marvin r shanken editor and publisher of cigar aficionado magazine cigar aficionado this year begins a new era for culbro how would you articulate your fathers contribution to the company and has the transition been difficult cullman well first let me say the transition wasnt difficult the decision was one that he knew he had to make it was just a question of when he knew that it was going to happen and he knew who was going to be taking over thats made it easier for his achievements youve got to go back to  when my father first bought in to the general cigar co he bought a controlling interest at that point it was really the culmination of his love of tobacco and the cigar industry over the years he added a lot of businesses many of which are not part of culbro today but the cigar business is still part of culbro and it has been his vision all along and his love he realized that if he could put all of those efforts against a business that was less difficult than the cigar business he might have made more money he might have been more successful but at the end of the day he wouldnt have been as happy because he loved the cigar business for him its been difficult to separate what is business and what is personal interest if theres a legacy that he passes on to me it is that if you hang onto it long enough and you believe in it it comes back look at what is going on today in the cigar business i pushed to deemphasize the cigar business in the s and early s we were struggling you couldnt shed assets fast enough to maintain any viability it is remarkable what has happened so if theres a legacy here its to follow your heart and the things that you really believe in you can add tremendous value in that kind of situation thats what he has done all of his life ca when you joined the company in  what was your attitude towards cigars and has it changed cullman i knew very little about cigars except through my fathers discussions at the dinner table or other places in  after getting discharged from the army i had spent about three years with what at that time was manufacturers hanover trust co which is now chase bank i knew very little about the cigar business or the tobacco business but i enjoyed smoking cigars i enjoyed the legacy the family legacy it was reassuring to know that i was entering a business that was not necessarily started by my father or even by my grandfather but started really by my greatgrandfather that gives you a certain feeling of a place that you belong and i felt right along that i belonged i started working in puerto rico where we were sorting connecticut wrappers i learned the process from a to z i lived down in puerto rico my wife was pregnant with our first child and very upset that i wasnt home but we lived through those first years it was a real learning experience ca how long did you do that cullman it wasnt that long i spent from  to about  in a training mode in various positions throughout the company i was in puerto rico i was in kingston jamaica tampa florida where we had an operation and in philipsburg pennsylvania where we had a cigar factory i was moving from our handmade factories to our machinemade factories throughout i was learning everything about the cigar business from tobacco growing and processing through cigar making ca after that training program what happened in the next two or three years cullman my father constantly pushed me to do things just as i was getting comfortable understanding something he would push me on to something else i became head of the connecticut operation which was at that time the real estate business the nursery business and the tobaccogrowing business all three divisions reported to one person who was also head of the tobacco business that influenced the emphasis that was given to the other two businesses i was a sort of king solomon who sorted out the needs of the various businesses i learned a lot about the nursery business and the real estate business from there i went on to be president of general cigar i also had been head of all tobacco operations where i worked with alfons mayer the head tobacco buyer for the company ca how big was general cigar in terms of revenues when you became president in  cullman less than half of what it is today our peak year was in  when revenues were around  million in the late s it was struggling at around  million but weve been growing rapidly in  revenues were about  million and climbed to  million in  and in  we expect at least 3 million ca lets go back for a minute you are the fourth generation in the business how did it start cullman my greatgrandfather who came from germany started in tobacco and later wrapper tobacco for cigars ca when was the peak of culbro tobacco farming operations in connecticut cullman well i guess there were several golden eras my grandfather started growing tobacco around  in the connecticut river valley that was when connecticut shade was introduced to the connecticut valley prior to that he was dealing in tobaccos from around the world such as indonesia and other countries ca in an earlier interview with your father he said that culbro at one point had about  acres of tobacco cullman yes ca today how many acres do you own of wrapper tobacco land and of that how much is being farmed cullman we still own about  acres of land in connecticut but most of it is not available for tobacco now i shouldnt say most of it a good portion of it we have about 33 acres that were growing this summer ca isnt that substantially lower than in the past cullman way down ca but with the demand for largeleaf connecticut wrappers growing so rapidly why is the farming operation getting smaller and smaller cullman it actually has increased in the last three years it was down to about  acres when we hit our lowest point the biggest problem is that every acre costs at least  to grow its just a risky and expensive business were able to today because of our involvement with the grower oliver thrall to have access to a lot more tobacco than we had before thrall is one of the growers in connecticut who used to be with windsor shade he has broken away from windsor shade as of last year we processed tobacco for him in the dominican republic and our agreement is such that we have first pick of certain tobaccos that he grows the real demand is for tobaccos for premium cigars not for domestically made cigars what we used to do is sell a significant portion of our tobacco to english buyers and use some of the rest for ourselves and for domestic cigars the higher primings the tobaccos that had more guts were used for macanudo but we really are not in the business of growing tobacco for other manufacturers ca how many acres does thrall farm cullman he farms about 3plus acres ca but unlike windsor shade youre vertically integrated cullman yes in that we use a lot of the tobacco we grow ca and what you dont use for yourself the higher quality tobacco you sell primarily to the english market cullman right ca its not sold to other cigar manufacturers  3 autumn  out of the humidor out of the humidor editors note smokers have rights too celebrities gms ad man cigar stars mariana and nestor miranda miami cigar  co celebrities the real
