software uk usa us english support home  case studies  sullivan tire  auto sullivan tire  auto background sullivan tire  auto service was founded in  by bob sullivan and despite rapid expansion remains a family owned business to this day  now boasting over  associates across five states the business consists of over  complete auto care facilities  commercial truck centers and  bandag retreading manufacturing facilities  the company operates ten wholesale centers and has over  square feet of warehouse space and stocks every major tire brand situation sullivan tire  auto service had historically used a dosbased system to manage their business operations  however as time went on and the company expanded in size it became increasingly apparent that this legacy system was no longer suitable for a modern enterprise of its size  we had our old dos system for over  years recalls joseph zaccheo cfo of sullivan tire  auto service  the old system certainly gave us our moneys worth but we knew we needed to upgrade to modern technology  we wanted to improve the experience for our customers and the only way to do this was to look for a better solution and make the switch solution we were looking for a modern stateoftheart windowsbased system said joe  the x and y generations have grown up on windows technology and it is easier to train new employees on a windows based platform a huge timesaver considering our rapid growth  as far as functionality was concerned we needed something that had integrated parts labor lookup and factory scheduled maintenance data embedded into the system benefits upon upgrading to vast the improvements to sullivan tire  auto service were significant and numerous  “we saw an immediate improvement to our profit margins as a result of vast’s pricing matrixes” joe says also the declined services feature has helped us increase the trust we have with our customers by keeping track of all services needed to properly maintain their vehicles  sales associates simply tag services or items that have been suggested or declined and when the customer returns or calls for an appointment these items can be reviewed and offered on a return visit history lookup in vast is a breeze you can drill down to see where a part or tire was purchased and what the cost was including the po and vendor invoice number  email and fax capabilities have reduced the costs and time involved in delivering workorders and invoices to customers  using the factory maintenance scheduling information when inputting vehicle mileage and the subsequent recommended service printout is quick and informative and can be easily explained to the customer  the way in which vast displays tire images at the counter is also invaluable especially when you are explaining the attributes to customers and do not have the specific tire in stock get in touch if you’d like to find out more about mam software systems and how they could improve your business
