year is sage products llc october   in approximately one month – on december th  – the illinois venture capital association will gather for the ivca annual awards dinner the yearly event honors the persons and organizations that have made an impact both within the association the broader vcpe industries and the community at large the ivca newsletter continues its profiles of the  honorees with the private equity portfolio company of the year sage products llc in  madison dearborn partners mdp acquired sage products from their four cofounders  the company is a leading developer of products used to prevent hospitalacquired conditions such as ventilatorassociated conditions skin injury due to incontinence pressure ulcers surgical site infections and healthcare worker injury sage looked for unmet medical needs and developed innovative solutions the company has consistently created new markets and product categories in patient infection control and preventative care in april of  after working with the management of sage products to increase revenues by almost  and net earnings by  madison dearborn partners sold the company to michiganbased stryker for  times its original investment the background of this amazing private equity success story came about through a casual conversation which resulted in a four year journey which lead to the successful exit the origins it was a dinner hosted in  by rita canning the wife of madison dearborn partners chairman john a canning jr that sparked the firm’s interest in sage products inc sage chairman vincent foglia was in attendance and mentioned that the four cofounders of the cary illinois company was mulling a possible sale six months later mdp acquired sage for  billion at the time sage had  million in annual sales and  associates the reasoning “the first order of business was recognizing ‘let’s not kill the golden goose’” recalled mdp’s timothy sullivan a cofounder and managing director of the healthcare team over more than four decades sage had established a veteran and experienced management team and possessed a welldefined pipeline of new products that typically launched a new franchise every three to four years they sourced ideas from clinicians and focused on internal rd for new product ideas in addition to acquiring and developing early stage products the partnership mdp worked with sage management and managers on strategy review and on certain initiatives such as an international sales summit the firm helped develop mdp has an arm that specifically helps portfolio companies look at growth investments that experienced group helped sage look in particular at growing international sales the number of its own new products and the number of new commercial products it could acquire subsequently sage hired  sales reps three marketing and new productdevelopment executives as well as product development and marketing teams to adapt existing products and practices for european markets expansion and opportunities mdp used a revamped human resources as a way to adjust the sales department at sage culture shift and sales force disengagement easily could have occurred because even though sage expanded its sales territories to  from  its broader sales team grew to approximately  employees shrinking the size of those territories sage and its hr team focused on communication regarding all that restructuring transparently the result the typical sales rep made more or the same total compensation than in the previous year despite shrinking their respective territory mdp also convinced sage – which primarily had always created its products – to expand the acquisition of new products and to look at smaller opportunities of commercial products ready to sell one such acquisition identified was in the patient mobility space that helps nurses lift heavy patients onto a gurney through a novel method using inflating blowers sage was able to successfully negotiate and consummate that transaction in january of  the exit while mdp typically invests in a portfolio company for around five years sage had always maintained an open policy in talking to possible suitors in the latter part of  the company received strong interest from a couple of prospective strategic acquirers at the time the healthrelated market and public companies’ stocks were trading at historic highs stryker became the next sage products steward based in kalamazoo michigan stryker has a strong culture and values similar to sage products as well as a decentralized organization that would let sage continue to do what it did best also stryker’s strong international sales force was viewed as a positive the sale was consummated for  billion in the  months with mdp sage products sales rose from  million annually to  million the workforce increased from  associates to  the acquisition closed on april st  mdp itself generated  billion on behalf of its investors a gross return of  times invested capital and an internal rate of return of roughly  percent the ceo of sage products d scott brown articulated why mdp’s assistance proved so helpful “i learned in a short period of time how to think about our business differently with mdp’s counsel we were a company owned by the same founders for  years and mdp asked all the questions we never asked ourselves simple things like ‘have you ever thought about doing this or that’” they were engaged every step of the way and so committed to success” the  ivca awards dinner is open for ticket and table purchase by ivca members  nonmembers
