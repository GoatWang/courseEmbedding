– physician and antiquary was the fifth child and third son of david sibbald third brother of sir david sibbald knightbaronet of rankeillour fifeshire and keeper of the great seal under the chancellorship of the earl of kinnoull by margaret boyd eldest daughter of robert boyd of kippis advocate he was born in edinburgh on  april  according to his own statement in his ‘autobiography’ ‘in a house near to the head of blackfriars wynd upon the left side’ since his ‘older brothers and sisters had died hectic’ he was on the advice of his uncle dr george sibbald of gibleston suckled for two years and to this circumstance he ascribed both the preservation of his life and his robust health at an early age he showed great aptitude for study in  his parents being then resident in fife he was sent to the burgh school of cupar next year they removed to dundee and during the siege of that town by monck sibbald narrowly escaped with his life and his father was severely wounded during the pillage of the town the family were robbed of nearly everything they possessed and had to return to fife on foot he was next sent to the high school of edinburgh and thence to the university where he remained five years partly through the influence of leighton who was then principal he became possessed of ‘strong inclinations to a serious and good life’ ‘shunned the plays and divertissements’ the other students followed and read much ‘in his study for which’ his fellows gave him ‘the name of “diogenes in dolo”’ for a time he studied theology and cherished some intention of entering the church but because he ‘preferred a quiet life’ where he ‘might not be engaged in factions of church or state’ he finally fixed upon medicine and that he might also ‘see the world and know men’ he resolved to prosecute the study of it abroad in  he went to leyden where he remained a year and a half and in  took the degree of md his dissertation on the occasion being published under the title ‘de variis tabis speciebus’ from leyden he went to paris and during a sojourn there of nine months made the acquaintance of guido and patin he then proceeded to angers and after taking his doctors degree there on  june  went to london where he remained three months in october he returned to edinburgh and began the practice of medicine with the determination to pass quietly through the world and content himself with ‘a moderate fortune’ with a view to investigating what materia medica in the way of herbs scotland was capable of producing sibbald along with dr andrew balfour resolved about  to institute a botanical garden in edinburgh and for this purpose they obtained a piece of ground belonging to holyrood house—‘of some forty feet every way’—which they stocked with about eight or nine hundred plants the scheme having attracted the attention of the other physicians in the city soon obtained more general support and from the town council they secured the lease of the garden belonging to trinity hospital with adjacent grounds sibbald was also chiefly instrumental in founding the royal college of physicians of edinburgh for which a charter was obtained on  nov  on  sept  he was appointed physician to charles ii and on  dec of the same year geographer of scotland this latter appointment he obtained through the earl of perth at whose instance and by whose help he had for some time begun to make collections for a geographical and statistical account of scotland with a description of the natural history of the kingdom ‘this’ he says ‘was the cause of great pains and very much expense to me in buying all the books and manuscripts i could gather for that use and procuring information from all parts of the country even the remote isles’ he also employed an assistant john adair to whom he ‘paid a guinea for each double of the maps he made’ and who was further subsidised by the gentry and the public the most elaborate work of sibbald referring to the natural history of scotland was his ‘scotia illustrata sive prodromus historiæ naturalis in quo regionis natura incolarum ingenia et mores morbi iisque medendi methodus et medicina indigena accurate explicantur’ edinburgh  the work was severely attacked by dr pitcairne in  and many of his strictures are deserved for much of its information was based on the communications of ignorant and credulous correspondents sibbald replied in  in a pamphlet entitled ‘vindiciæ scotiæ illustratæ sive prodromi naturalis historiæ scotiæ contra prodromastiges sub larva libelli de legibus historiæ naturalis latentes’ although commanded by the king to publish the natural history of the country sibbald according to his own account received nothing for his pains but a payment of a hundred guineas from james vii as his physician on  march  in december  sibbald was elected president of the royal college of physicians edinburgh and in march  he was appointed by the town council of edinburgh the first professor of medicine in the university the same year occurred what he terms the ‘difficultest passage of my life’ when through intercourse with his patron the earl of perth and the perusal of the lives of certain saintly catholics he resolved to become a convert to catholicism in consequence of his change of faith his house in carrubers close was broken into by a fanatic mob who swore they would ‘rathillet’ ie assassinate him and probably would have done so had he not made his escape by a back yard unable to continue his practice in edinburgh he went for a time to london where on  march  he was elected a member of the college of physicians but either because he found london uncongenial or because as he states his personal contact with the jesuits there and the knowledge of the evil influence they exercised over the mind of the king caused a strong reaction his religious views underwent a sudden change ‘i repented of my rashness’ he says ‘and resolved to come home and return to the church i was born in’ in  sibbald presented his natural history collection to the university of edinburgh with a catalogue which was printed at the expense of the university entitled ‘auctarium musæi balfouriani e musæo sibbaldino’ he died in august  and in the same year was printed at edinburgh ‘a catalogue of the library of the late learned and ingenious sir robert sibbald of kippis doctor of medicine to be sold by auction’ the library was sold on  feb  a large number of his books and manuscripts being purchased for the advocates library edinburgh an engraving of his portrait from the original picture in the royal college of physicians is prefixed to his ‘remains’  sibbald is perhaps best known for his ‘history ancient and modern of the sheriffdom of fife and kinross’ edinburgh  cupar fifeshire  belonging to a fife family he had a very special interest in as well as an intimate acquaintance with the shire but he was the author of many other geographical and antiquarian works
