wikipedia capital good from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search a capital good is a durable good one that does not quickly wear out that is used in the production of goods or services capital goods are one of the three types of producer goods the other two being land and labour which are also known collectively as primary factors of production this classification originated during the classical economicsclassical economic period and has remained the dominant method for classification capital goods are acquired by a society by saving wealth which can be invested in the means of production in terms of economics one can consider capital goods to be tangible propertythey are used to produce other goods or services during a certain period of time machinery tools buildings computers or other kind of equipment that is involved in production of other things for sale represent the term of a capital good the owners of the capital good can be individuals households corporations or governments any material that is used in production of other goods is also considered to be a capital good many definitions and descriptions of capital goods production have been proposed in the literature capital goods are generally considered oneofakind capital intensive products that consist of many components they are often used as manufacturing systems or services themselves examples include battleships oil rigs baggage handling systems and roller coaster equipment their production is often organized in projects with several parties cooperating in networks hicks et al  hicks and mcgovern  hobday  a capital good lifecycle typically consists of tendering engineering and procurement manufacturing commissioning maintenance and sometimes decommissioning blanchard  hicks et al  hobday  vianello and ahmed   contents  differences between capital and consumer goods  the importance of capital goods  investment required  capital goods in international trade  see also  references differences between capital and consumer goodsedit one should distinguish capital goods from consumption as the aim of their purchase is different from the production of things an example of it is a good car that is normally considered to be a consumer good as it is bought for a private usage nevertheless dump trucks used by manufacturing or constructing companies are obviously a production goods the reason is that they assist in creating things like roads dams buildings or bridges the same way a chocolate candy bar is a consumer good but the machines that are used to produce the candy would be considered production goods some of the capital goods can be used in both production of consumer goods or production ones such as machinery for production of dump trucks it is generally considered that the consumption is the logical result of all economic activity but it is also obvious that the level of the future consumption depends on the future capital stock and this in turn depends on the current level of production in the capitalgoods sector hence if there is a desire to increase the consumption the output of the capital goods should be maximized  the importance of capital goodsedit capital goods often called complex products and systems cops gann and salter  hobday  play an important role in today’s economy acha et al  aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers capital goods are important in other ways in an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies if a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product for example it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market such a company might turn to another business to supply its products but this can be expensive as well this means that in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a businesss start up costs the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small investment requirededit the acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company when a business is struggling it will often put off such purchases as long as possible since it does not make sense to spend money on equipment if the company is not around to use it capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products a potentially positive economic sign in most cases capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense these goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services as a result they are sometimes referred to as producers goods production goods or means of production capital goods in international tradeedit in the theory of the international trade the causes and nature of trade of capital goods receive little attention trade in capital goods is a crucial part of

deployed to help increase future production the most common capital goods are property plant and equipment or ppe consumer goods are any goods that are not capital goods they are goods used by

economics capital goods are tangible objects that are used in the production of other goods or commodities or during the providing of services they can include things such as buildings machinery tools computers and any other equipment that is used to make or do something else which can then be sold to another party the means of production might be owned by individuals businesses organizations or governments this term also refers to any material used or consumed while other goods are being produced or services are being provided investment required in most cases capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense these goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services as a result they are sometimes referred to as producers goods production goods or means of production capital goods vs capital the economic term capital goods should not be confused with the financial term capital which simply refers to money or wealth production goods generally are manmade and do not include natural resources such as land or minerals they also do not include human capital — the labor intellectual skills and physical skills provided by people in the production of other goods so for example a company that provides limousine services would include its fleet of limousines and its facilities among its capital goods but its drivers would not be included different from consumer goods a distinction also should be made between capital and consumer goods which are purchased for purposes other than to be used in the production of other things for example cars generally are considered consumer goods because they are often bought by individuals for personal use dump trucks however might be considered production goods if they are used by construction and manufacturing companies to assist in making products such as roads bridges dams or buildings similarly a chocolate candy bar is a consumer good but the machines that are used to produce the candy would be considered production goods capital goods typically are used to produce consumer goods but they also might be used to manufacture other production goods a company that builds dump trucks for example requires equipment and facilities to create that vehicle the importance of capital goods aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers capital goods are important in other ways in an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies if a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product for example it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market such a company might turn to another business to supply its products but this can be expensive as well this means that in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a businesss start up costs the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small the acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company so spending on such assets is often watched closely by economists when a business is struggling it will often put off such purchases as long as possible since it doesnt make sense to spend money on equipment if the company isnt around to use it capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products a potentially positive economic sign tax implications money spent to buy or improve equipment factories and other similar assets is called a capital expenditure under standard accounting rules because the asset wont be useful for just the year in which it was purchased it must be depreciated over time a fixed percentage of the value of the asset can be deducted

business  economics  difference between consumer goods and capital goodsdifference between consumer goods and capital goods posted on july   by olivia last updated on july   consumer goods vs capital goods there are two types of goods namely consumer goods and capital goods why this dichotomy you might wonder but then can you compare a machine that produces shampoo sachets with the sachets themselves that are ultimately used by end consumers though both are goods they are entirely different in form and function aren’t they this is not the only difference between capital and consumer goods as would be clear to you after reading this article as their name implies consumer goods are goods meant for the end consumers whether you buy a cold drink a pack of cigarettes or a laptop they are going to be utilized by you and hence classify as consumer goods bread that you buy from market is a consumer good but the huge oven that is used by the company manufacturing bread is classified as a capital good consumer goods are thus products that are bought from retail stores for personal or household need on the other hand capital goods are goods that are used to make more goods which are to be used by end consumers all machinery equipment even factories that are used to produce consumer goods come under the category of capital goods capital goods are not natural and are man made the word capital is enough to convey the impression that these are goods that are expensive and require a huge investment on the part of the company trying to make consumer goods cars and other automobiles are consumer goods but dump trucks are not classified under consumer goods this is because they are mainly used by construction companies to haul other vehicles and not by end consumers what is the difference between consumer goods and capital goods • capital goods are goods used to make more consumer goods whereas consumer goods are goods meant for the use of end consumers only • one buys consumer goods from retail stores for personal family or household use • capital goods are bought by companies desirous of making the consumer goods • machines tools equipments are examples
