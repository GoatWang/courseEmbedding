funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average this funds expenses are rated as below average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment
