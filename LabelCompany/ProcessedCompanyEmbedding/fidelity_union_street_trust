reports every six months detailing fund holdings and describing recent investment activities debt securities bonds and other debt instruments are used by issuers to borrow money from investors the issuer pays the investor a fixed or variable rate of interest and must repay the amount borrowed at maturity some debt securities such as zero coupon bonds do not pay current interest but are purchased at a discount from their face values debt securities have varying degrees of quality and varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates longerterm bonds are generally more sensitive to interest rate changes than shortterm bonds lowerquality debt securities sometimes called municipal junk bonds may have speculative characteristics and involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the issuers creditworthiness the market prices of these securities may fluctuate more than higherquality securities and may decline significantly in periods of general or regional economic difficulty debt ratings moodys standard amp poors investors service inc corporation rating rating investment grade highest quality aaa aaa high quality aa aa uppermedium grade a a

currently intends to limit its investments in debt securities to those rated b or above and unrated securities judged by fmr to be of equivalent quality municipal securities are issued to raise money for a variety of public purposes including general financing for state and local governments or financing for specific projects or public facilities municipal securities may be issued in anticipation of future revenues and may be backed by the full taxing power of a municipality the revenues from a specific project or the credit of a private organization a securitys credit may be enhanced by a bank insurance company or other financial institution a fund may own a municipal security directly or through a participation interest state taxfree securities include municipal obligations issued by the state of arizona or its counties municipalities authorities or other subdivisions the ability of issuers to repay their debt can be affected by many factors that impact the economic vitality of either the state or a region within the state other state taxfree securities include general obligations of us territories and possessions such as guam the virgin islands and puerto rico and their political subdivisions and public corporations the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the us economy and will depend on the strength of the us dollar interest rates the price stability of oil imports and the continued existence of favorable tax incentives recent legislation reduced these incentives but it is impossible to predict what impact the changes will have municipal lease obligations are used by municipalities to acquire land equipment or facilities if the municipality stops making payments or transfers its obligations to a private entity the obligation could lose value or become taxable private entities may be involved in some municipal securities for example industrial revenue bonds are backed by private entities and resource recovery bonds often involve private corporations the viability of a project or tax incentives could affect the value and credit quality of these securities assetbacked securities may include pools of purchase contracts financing leases or sales agreements entered into by municipalities these securities usually rely on continued payments by a municipality and may also be subject to prepayment risk variable and floatingrate instruments may have interest rates that move in tandem with a benchmark helping to stabilize their prices inverse floaters have interest rates that move in the opposite direction from the benchmark making the instruments market value more volatile put features entitle the holder to put sell back an instrument to the issuer or a financial intermediary in exchange for this benefit a fund may pay periodic fees or accept a lower interest rate demand features standby commitments and tender options are types of put features adjusting investment exposure a fund can use various techniques to increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices interest rates or other factors that affect security values these techniques may involve derivative transactions such as buying and selling options and futures contracts and purchasing indexed securities fmr can use these practices to adjust the risk and return characteristics of a funds portfolio of investments if fmr judges market conditions incorrectly or employs a strategy that does not correlate well with the funds investments these techniques could result in a loss regardless of whether the intent was to reduce risk or increase return these techniques may increase the volatility of the fund and may involve a small investment of cash relative to the magnitude of the risk assumed in addition these techniques could result in a loss if the counterparty to the transaction does not perform as promised whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions are trading practices in which payment and delivery for the securities take place at a future date the market value of a security could change during this period which could affect a funds yield or the market value of its assets illiquid and restricted securities some investments may be determined by fmr under the supervision of the board of trustees to be illiquid which means that they may be difficult to sell promptly at an acceptable price the sale of other securities including illiquid securities may be subject to legal restrictions difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund restrictions a fund may not purchase a security if as a result more than  of its assets would be invested in illiquid securities diversification diversifying a funds investment portfolio can reduce the risks of investing this may include limiting the amount of money invested in any one issuer or on a broader scale in any one industry or type of project economic business or political changes can affect all securities of a similar type a fund that is not diversified may be more sensitive to these changes and also to changes in the market value of a single issuer or industry restrictions the funds are considered nondiversified generally to meet federal tax requirements at the close of each quarter a fund does not invest more than  of its total assets in any one issuer and with respect to  of total assets does not invest more than  of its total assets in any one issuer these limitations do not apply to us government securities a fund may invest more than  of its total assets in taxfree securities that finance similar types of projects borrowing a fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by fmr or through reverse repurchase agreements if a bond fund borrows money its share price may be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is paid off if the fund makes additional investments while borrowings are outstanding this may be considered a form of leverage restrictions a fund may borrow

bank transactions a fund may engage in transactions with financial institutions that are or may be considered to be affiliated persons of the fund under the investment company act of  these transactions may include repurchase agreements with custodian banks shortterm obligations of and repurchase agreements with the  largest us banks measured by deposits municipal securities us government securities with affiliated financial institutions that are primary dealers in these securities shortterm currency transactions and shortterm borrowings in accordance with exemptive orders issued by the securities and exchange commission the board of trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures applicable to transactions involving affiliated financial institutions quality and maturity money market fund only pursuant to procedures adopted by the board of trustees the fund may purchase only highquality securities that fmr believes present minimal credit risks to be considered highquality a security must be a us government security rated in accordance with applicable rules in one of the two highest categories for shortterm securities by at least two nationally recognized rating services or by one if only one rating service has rated the security or if unrated judged to be of equivalent quality by fmr the fund currently intends to limit its investments to securities with remaining maturities of  days or less and to maintain a dollarweighted average maturity of  days or less delayeddelivery transactions each fund may buy and sell securities on a delayeddelivery or whenissued basis these transactions involve a commitment by a fund to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined price or yield with payment and delivery taking place after the customary settlement period for that type of security and more than seven days in the future typically no interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered the income fund may receive fees for entering into delayeddelivery transactions when purchasing securities on a delayeddelivery basis each fund assumes the rights and risks of ownership including the risk of price and yield fluctuations because a fund is not required to pay for securities until the delivery date these risks are in addition to the risks associated with the funds other investments if a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when delayeddelivery purchases are outstanding the delayeddelivery purchases may result in a form of leverage when delayeddelivery purchases are outstanding the fund will set aside appropriate liquid assets in a segregated custodial account to cover its purchase obligations when a fund has sold a security on a delayeddelivery basis the fund does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security if the other party to a delayeddelivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for the securities the fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or could suffer a loss each fund may renegotiate delayeddelivery transactions after they are entered into and may sell underlying securities before they are delivered which may result in capital gains or losses refunding contracts the income fund may purchase securities on a whenissued basis in connection with the refinancing of an issuers outstanding indebtedness refunding contracts require the issuer to sell and the fund to buy refunded municipal obligations at a stated price and yield on a settlement date that may be several months or several years in the future the fund generally will not be obligated to pay the full purchase price if it fails to perform under a refunding contract instead refunding contracts generally provide for payment of liquidated damages to the issuer currently  of the purchase price the fund may secure its obligations under a refunding contract by depositing collateral or a letter of credit equal to the liquidated damages provisions of the refunding contract when required by sec guidelines the fund will place liquid assets in a segregated custodial account equal in amount to its obligations under refunding contracts inverse floaters the income fund may invest in inverse floaters which are instruments whose interest rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or the value of an index changes in the interest rate on the other security or index inversely affect the residual interest rate paid on the inverse floater with the result that the inverse floaters price will be considerably more volatile than that of a fixedrate bond for example a municipal issuer may decide to issue two variablerate instruments instead of a single longterm fixedrate bond the interest rate on one instrument reflects shortterm interest rates while the interest rate on the other instrument the inverse floater reflects the approximate rate the issuer would have paid on a fixedrate bond multiplied by two minus the interest rate paid on the shortterm instrument depending on market availability the two portions may be recombined to form a fixedrate municipal bond the market for inverse floaters is relatively new variable or floating rate obligations bear variable or floating interest rates and carry rights that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries floating rate instruments have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a designated base rate while variable rate instruments provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate these formulas are designed to result in a market value for the instrument that approximates its par value with respect to the money market fund a demand instrument with a conditional demand feature must have received both a shortterm and a longterm highquality rating or if unrated have been determined to be of comparable quality pursuant to procedures adopted by the board of trustees a demand instrument with an unconditional demand feature may be acquired solely in reliance upon a shortterm highquality rating or if unrated upon a finding of comparable shortterm quality pursuant to procedures adopted by the board of trustees the funds may invest in fixedrate bonds that are subject to third party puts and in participation interests in such bonds held in trust or otherwise these bonds and participation interests have tender options or demand features that permit a fund to tender or put the bonds to an institution at periodic intervals and to receive the principal amount thereof a fund considers variable rate instruments structured in this way participating vrdos to be essentially equivalent to other vrdos it purchases the irs has not ruled whether the interest on participating vrdos is taxexempt and accordingly a fund intends to purchase these instruments based on opinions of bond counsel the money market fund may invest in variable or floating rate instruments that ultimately mature in more than  days if the fund acquires a right to sell the instruments that meets certain requirements set forth in rule a variable rate instruments including instruments subject to a demand feature that mature in  days or less may be deemed to have maturities equal to the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate other variable rate instruments with demand features may be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next adjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand a floating rate instrument subject to a demand feature may be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand tender option bonds are created by coupling an intermediate or longterm fixedrate taxexempt bond generally held pursuant to a custodial arrangement with a tender agreement that gives the holder the option to tender the bond at its face value as consideration for providing the tender option the sponsor usually a bank brokerdealer or other financial institution receives periodic fees equal to the difference between the bonds fixed coupon rate and the rate determined by a remarketing or similar agent that would cause the bond coupled with the tender option to trade at par on the date of such determination after payment of the tender option fee a fund effectively holds a demand obligation that bears interest at the prevailing shortterm taxexempt rate subject to applicable regulatory requirements the money market fund may buy tender option bonds if the agreement gives the fund the right to tender the bond to its sponsor no less frequently than once every  days in selecting tender option bonds for the funds fmr will consider the creditworthiness of the issuer of the underlying bond the custodian and the third party provider of the tender option in certain instances a sponsor may terminate a tender option if for example the issuer of the underlying bond defaults on interest payments zero coupon bonds do not make regular interest payments instead they are sold at a deep discount from their face value and are redeemed at face value when they mature because zero coupon bonds do not pay current income their prices can be very volatile when interest rates change in calculating its daily dividend a fund takes into account as income a portion of the difference between a zero coupon bonds purchase price and its face value standby commitments are puts that entitle holders to sameday settlement at an exercise price equal to the amortized cost of the underlying security plus accrued interest if any at the time of exercise each fund may acquire standby commitments to enhance the liquidity of portfolio securities but in the case of the money market fund only when the issuers of the commitments present minimal risk of default ordinarily a fund will not transfer a standby commitment to a third party although it could sell the underlying municipal security to a third party at any time a fund may purchase standby commitments separate from or in conjunction with the purchase of securities subject to such commitments in the latter case the fund would pay a higher price for the securities acquired thus reducing their yield to maturity standby commitments will not affect the dollarweighted average maturity of the money market fund or the valuation of the securities underlying the commitments issuers or financial intermediaries may obtain letters of credit or other guarantees to support their ability to buy securities on demand fmr may rely upon its evaluation of a banks credit in determining whether to support an instrument supported by a letter of credit in evaluating a foreign banks credit fmr will consider whether adequate public information about the bank is available and whether the bank may be subject to unfavorable political or economic developments currency controls or other governmental restrictions that might affect the banks ability to honor its credit commitment standby commitments are subject to certain risks including the ability of issuers of standby commitments to pay for securities at the time the commitments are exercised the fact that standby commitments are not marketable by the funds and the possibility that the maturities of the underlying securities may be different from those of the commitments municipal lease obligations each fund may invest a portion of its assets in municipal leases and participation interests therein these obligations which may take the form of a lease an installment purchase or a conditional sale contract are issued by state and local governments and authorities to acquire land and a wide variety of equipment and facilities generally the funds will not hold such obligations directly as a lessor of the property but will purchase a participation interest in a municipal obligation from a bank or other third party a participation interest gives a fund a specified undivided interest in the obligation in proportion to its purchased interest in the total amount of the obligation municipal leases frequently have risks distinct from those associated with general obligation or revenue bonds state constitutions and statutes set forth requirements that states or municipalities must meet to incur debt these may include voter referenda interest rate limits or public sale requirements leases installment purchases or conditional sale contracts which normally provide for title to the leased asset to pass to the governmental issuer have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to acquire property and equipment without meeting their constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of debt many leases and contracts include nonappropriation clauses providing that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for such purposes by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis nonappropriation clauses free the issuer from debt issuance limitations federally taxable obligations the funds do not intend to invest in securities whose interest is federally taxable however from time to time each fund may invest a portion of its assets on a temporary basis in fixedincome obligations whose interest is subject to federal income tax for example each fund may invest in obligations whose interest is federally taxable pending the investment or reinvestment in municipal securities of proceeds from the sale of its shares or sales of portfolio securities should a fund invest in federally taxable obligations it would purchase securities that in fmrs judgment are of high quality these would include obligations issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities obligations of domestic banks and repurchase agreements the income funds standards for high quality taxable obligations are essentially the same as those described by moodys investors service inc moodys in rating corporate obligations within its two highest ratings of prime and prime and those described by standard amp poors corporation sampp in rating corporate obligations within its two highest ratings of a and a the money market fund will purchase taxable obligations only if they meet its quality requirements proposals to restrict or eliminate the federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal obligations are introduced before congress from time to time proposals also may be introduced before the arizona legislature that would affect the state tax treatment of the funds distributions if such proposals were enacted the availability of municipal obligations and the value of the funds holdings would be affected and the trustees would reevaluate the funds investment objectives and policies each fund anticipates being as fully invested as practicable in municipal securities however there may be occasions when as a result of maturities of portfolio securities sales of fund shares or in order to meet redemption requests a fund may hold cash that is not earning income in addition there may be occasions when in order to raise cash to meet redemptions a fund may be required to sell securities at a loss repurchase agreements in a repurchase agreement a fund purchases a security and simultaneously commits to resell that security to the seller at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon date within a number of days from the date of purchase the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreedupon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security a repurchase agreement is a taxable obligation which involves the obligation of the seller to pay the agreedupon price which obligation is in effect secured by the value at least equal to the amount of the agreedupon resale price and marked to market daily of the underlying security each fund may engage in repurchase agreements with respect to any security in which it is authorized to invest even if with respect to the money market fund the underlying security matures in more than  days while it does not presently appear possible to eliminate all risks from these transactions particularly the possibility of a decline in the market value of the underlying securities as well as delays and costs to the fund in connection with bankruptcy proceedings it is each funds current policy to limit repurchase agreements to parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by fmr reverse repurchase agreements in a reverse repurchase agreement a fund sells a portfolio instrument to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to repurchase the instrument at a particular price and time while a reverse repurchase agreement is outstanding the fund will maintain appropriate liquid assets in a segregated custodial account to cover its obligation under the agreement a fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements only with parties whose creditworthiness has been found satisfactory by fmr such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of a funds assets and may be viewed as a form of leverage illiquid investments are investments that cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued under the supervision of the board of trustees fmr determines the liquidity of a funds investments and through reports from fmr the board monitors investments in illiquid instruments in determining the liquidity of a funds investments fmr may consider various factors including  the frequency of trades and quotations  the number of dealers and prospective purchasers in the marketplace  dealer undertakings to make a market  the nature of the security including any demand or tender features and  the nature of the marketplace for trades including the ability to assign or offset a funds rights and obligations relating to the investment fmr may determine some restricted securities and municipal lease obligations to be illiquid for each fund investments currently considered by the income fund to be illiquid include overthecounter options however with respect to overthecounter options the income fund writes all or a portion of the value of the underlying instrument may be illiquid depending on the assets held to cover the option and the nature and terms of any agreement the fund may have to close out the option before expiration in the absence of market quotations illiquid investments are valued for purposes of monitoring amortized cost valuation money market fund or priced income fund at fair value as determined in good faith by a committee appointed by the board of trustees if through a change in values net assets or other circumstances a fund were in a position where more than  of its net assets were invested in illiquid securities it would seek to take appropriate steps to protect liquidity restricted securities generally can be sold in privately negotiated transactions pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of  or in a registered public offering where registration is required a fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop a fund might obtain a less favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security however in general the money market fund anticipates holding restricted securities to maturity or selling them in an exempt transaction indexed securities the income fund may purchase securities whose prices are indexed to the prices of other securities securities indices or other financial indicators indexed securities typically but not always are debt securities or deposits whose value at maturity or coupon rate is determined by reference to a specific instrument or statistic indexed securities have principal payments as well as coupon payments that depend on the performance of one or more interest rates their coupon rates or principal payments may change by several percentage points for every  interest rate change one example of indexed securities is inverse floaters the performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the performance of the security or other instrument to which they are indexed and may also be influenced by interest rate changes at the same time indexed securities are subject to the credit risks associated with the issuer of the security and their values may decline substantially if the issuers creditworthiness deteriorates indexed securities may be more volatile than the underlying instruments lowerquality municipal securities the income fund may invest a portion of its assets in lowerquality municipal securities as described in the prospectus while the market for arizona municipals is considered to be adequate adverse publicity and changing investor perceptions may affect the ability of outside pricing services used by the fund to value its portfolio securities and the funds ability to dispose of lowerquality bonds the outside pricing services are monitored by fmr and reported to the board to determine whether the services are furnishing prices that accurately reflect fair value the impact of changing investor perceptions may be especially pronounced in markets where municipal securities are thinly traded the fund may choose at its expense or in conjunction with others to pursue litigation or otherwise exercise its rights as a security holder to seek to protect the interests of security holders if it determines this to be in the best interest of the funds shareholders interfund borrowing program each fund has received permission from the sec to lend money to and borrow money from other funds advised by fmr or its affiliates but will participate in the interfund borrowing program only as a borrower interfund loans normally will extend overnight but can have a maximum duration of seven days a fund will borrow through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the costs of bank loans loans may be called on one days notice and the fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed electric utilities industry the electric utilities industry has been experiencing or may experience in the future problems including a the effects of inflation upon construction and operating costs b the availability and cost of fuel c the availability and cost of capital d the effects of conservation on energy demand e the effects of rapidly changing environmental safety and licensing requirements and other federal state and local regulations f timely and sufficient rate increases g opposition to nuclear power and h increased competition health care industry the health care industry is subject to regulatory action by a number of private and governmental agencies including federal state and local governmental agencies a major source of revenues for the health care industry is payments from the medicare and medicaid programs as a result the industry is sensitive to legislative changes and reductions in governmental spending for such programs numerous other factors may affect the industry such as general and local economic conditions demand for services expenses including malpractice insurance premiums and competition among health care providers in the future the following elements may adversely affect health care facility operations adoption of legislation proposing a national health insurance program medical and technological advances which dramatically alter the need for health services or the way in which such services are delivered and efforts by employers insurers and governmental agencies to reduce the costs of health insurance and healthcare services housing housing revenue bonds are generally issued by a state county city local housing authority or other public agency they are secured by the revenues derived from mortgages purchased with the proceeds from the bond issue it is extremely difficult to predict the supply of available mortgages to be purchased with the proceeds of an issue or the future cash flow from the underlying mortgages consequently there are risks that proceeds will exceed supply resulting in early retirement of bonds or that the homeowner repayments will create an irregular cash flow many factors may affect the financing of multifamily housing projects including acceptable completion of construction proper management occupancy and rent levels economic conditions and changes to current laws and regulations education in general there are two types of educationrelated bonds those issued to finance projects for public colleges and universities and those representing pooled interests in student loans bonds issued to supply public educational institutions with funds are subject to the risk of unanticipated revenue decline among the factors that may affect enrollment are restrictions on students ability to pay tuition availability of state and federal funding and general economic conditions student loan revenue bonds are backed by pools of student loans and are generally offered by state or substate authorities or commissions student loans are guaranteed by state guarantee agencies and reinsured by the department of education the risks associated with these issues is that default on the student loans may result in prepayment to bondholders and an earlierthananticipated retirement of the bond investment policies for income fund only limitations on futures and options transactions the fund intends to file a notice of eligibility for exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator with the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the national futures association which regulate trading in the futures markets before engaging in any purchases or sales of futures contracts or options on futures contracts the fund intends to comply with rule  under the commodity exchange act which limits the extent to which the fund can commit assets to initial margin deposits and option premiums in addition the fund will not a sell futures contracts purchase put options or write call options if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions b purchase futures contracts or write put options if as a result the funds total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and written put options would exceed  of its total assets or c purchase call options if as a result the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed  of the funds total assets these limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities and do not apply to securities that incorporate features similar to options the above limitations on the funds investments in futures contracts and options and the funds policies regarding futures contracts and options discussed elsewhere in this statement of additional information may be changed as regulatory agencies permit futures contracts when the fund purchases a futures contract it agrees to purchase a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date when the fund sells a futures contract it agrees to sell the underlying instrument at a specified future date the price at which the purchase and sale will take place is fixed when the fund enters into the contract some currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities such as us treasury bonds or notes and some are based on indices of securities prices such as the bond buyer municipal bond index futures can be held until their delivery dates or can be closed out before then if a liquid secondary market is available the value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument therefore purchasing futures contracts will tend to increase the funds exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument much as if it had purchased the underlying instrument directly when the fund sells a futures contract by contrast the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction contrary to the market selling futures contracts therefore will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes much as if the underlying instrument had been sold futures margin payments the purchaser or seller of a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the contract is held until the delivery date however both the purchaser and seller are required to deposit initial margin with a futures broker known as a futures commission merchant fcm when the contract is entered into initial margin deposits are typically equal to a percentage of the contracts value if the value of either partys position declines that party will be required to make additional variation margin payments to settle the change in value on a daily basis the party that has a gain may be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount initial and variation margin payments do not constitute purchasing securities on margin for purposes of the funds investment limitations in the event of the bankruptcy of an fcm that holds margin on behalf of a fund the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the fcms other customers potentially resulting in losses to the fund purchasing put and call options by purchasing a put option the fund obtains the right but not the obligation to sell the options underlying instrument at a fixed strike price in return for this right the fund pays the current market price for the option known as the option premium options have various types of underlying instruments including specific securities indices of securities prices and futures contracts the fund may terminate its position in a put option it has purchased by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option if the option is allowed to expire the fund will lose the entire premium it paid if the fund exercises the option it completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike price the fund may also terminate a put option position by closing it out in the secondary market at its current price if a liquid secondary market exists the buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security prices fall substantially however if the underlying instruments price does not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option a put buyer can expect to suffer a loss limited to the amount of the premium paid plus related transaction costs the features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to purchase rather than sell the underlying instrument at the options strike price a call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential price increases of the underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost of the option if security prices fall at the same time the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option writing put and call options when the fund writes a put option it takes the opposite side of the transaction from the options purchaser in return for receipt of the premium the fund assumes the obligation to pay the strike price for the options underlying instrument if the other party to the option chooses to exercise it when writing an option on a futures contract the fund will be required to make margin payments to an fcm as described above for futures contracts the fund may seek to terminate its position in a put option it writes before exercise by closing out the option in the secondary market at its current price if the secondary market is not liquid for a put option the fund has written however the fund must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price while the option is outstanding regardless of price changes and must continue to set aside assets to cover its position if security prices rise a put writer generally would expect to profit although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received if security prices remain the same over time it is likely that the writer will also profit because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price if security prices fall the put writer would expect to suffer a loss this loss should be less than the loss from purchasing the underlying instrument directly however because the premium received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline writing a call option obligates the fund to sell or deliver the options underlying instrument in return for the strike price upon exercise of the option the characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if prices remain the same or fall through receipt of the option premium a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline at the same time because a call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price even if its current value is greater a call writer gives up some ability to participate in security price increases combined positions the fund may purchase and write options in combination with each other or in combination with futures or forward contracts to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position for example the fund may purchase a put option and write a call option on the same underlying instrument in order to construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract another possible combined position would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price in order to reduce the risk of the written call option in the event of a substantial price increase because combined options positions involve multiple trades they result in higher transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out correlation of price changes because there are a limited number of types of exchangetraded options and futures contracts it is likely that the standardized contracts available will not match the funds current or anticipated investments exactly the fund may invest in options and futures contracts based on securities with different issuers maturities or other characteristics from the securities in which it typically invests which involves a risk that the options or futures position will not track the performance of the funds other investments options and futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments even if the underlying instruments match the funds investments well options and futures prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated shortterm interest rates changes in volatility of the underlying instrument and the time remaining until expiration of the contract which may not affect security prices the same way imperfect correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options and futures markets and the securities markets from structural differences in how options and futures and securities are traded or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts the fund may purchase or sell options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities although this may not be successful in all cases if price changes in the funds options or futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in losses that are not offset by gains in other investments liquidity of options and futures contracts there is no assurance a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular options or futures contract at any particular time options may have relatively low trading volume and liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying instruments current price in addition exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for options and futures contracts and may halt trading if a contracts price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day on volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or a trading halt is imposed it may be impossible for the fund to enter into new positions or close out existing positions if the secondary market for a contract is not liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions and potentially could require the fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value as a result the funds access to other assets held to cover its options or futures positions could also be impaired otc options unlike exchangetraded options which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument expiration date contract size and strike price the terms of overthecounter options options not traded on exchanges generally are established through negotiation with the other party to the option contract while this type of arrangement allows the fund greater flexibility to tailor an option to their needs otc options generally involve greater credit risk than exchangetraded options which are guaranteed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where they are traded asset coverage for futures and options positions the fund will comply with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission with respect to coverage of options and futures strategies by mutual funds and if the guidelines so require will set aside appropriate liquid assets in a segregated custodial account in the amount prescribed securities held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the futures or option strategy is outstanding unless they are replaced with other suitable assets as a result there is a possibility that segregation of a large percentage of the funds assets could impede portfolio management or the funds ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations special factors affecting arizona certain arizona constitutional amendments legislative measures executive orders administrative regulations and voter initiatives as discussed below could adversely affect the market values and marketability of or result in default of existing obligations including obligations that may be held by the funds obligations of the state or local governments may also be affected by budgetary pressures affecting the state and economic

offerings of or on behalf of the state of arizona its agencies instrumentalities and political subdivisions and other publicly available documents as available on the date of this statement of additional information fmr has not independently verified any of the information contained in such official statements and other publicly available documents but is not aware of any fact which would render such information inaccurate constitutional limitations on taxes expenditures and revenue increases limitations on taxes certain obligations held by the funds may be obligations of issuers that rely in whole or in part directly or indirectly on ad valorem property taxes as a source of revenue the taxing powers of arizona local governments and districts are limited by arizona law arizonas property tax system was substantially revised by  amendments to the arizona constitution and implementing legislation there are two separate tax systems a primary system for taxes levied to pay current operation and maintenance expenses and a secondary system for taxes levied to pay principal and interest on bonded indebtedness special district assessments and tax overrides there are specific provisions under each system governing property value the basis of assessment and maximum annual tax levies under the primary system property value is the basis for determining primary property taxes of locally assessed real property and may increase by more than  per year only under certain circumstances under the secondary system there is no limitation on annual increases in full cash value of any property under the primary system annual tax levies are limited based on the nature of the property being taxed and the nature of the taxing authority taxes levied for primary purposes on residential property only are limited to  of the full cash value of such property in addition taxes levied for primary purposes on all types of property by counties cities towns and community college districts are limited to a maximum increase of  over the prior years levy plus any amount directly attributable to new construction and annexation and involuntary tort judgments the  limitation does not apply to taxes levied for primary purposes on behalf of local school districts annual tax levies for bonded indebtedness and special district assessments are unlimited under the secondary system expenditures limits provisions of the arizona constitution and arizona legislation limit increases in annual expenditures by counties cities and towns and community college districts and school districts to an amount determined by the arizona economic estimates commission this limitation is based on the entitys actual expenditures for fiscal year  with this base adjusted annually to reflect changes in population cost of living and boundaries limitations on revenue increases in november of  an amendment to the constitution of arizona was approved by the voters and signed by the governor the amendment states that any legislation that provides for a net increase in state revenues will be effective only on the affirmative vote of twothirds of the members of each house of the state legislature and gubernatorial approval if the governor vetoes the measure then the legislation shall not become effective unless the legislation is approved by an affirmative vote of threefourths of the members of each house the constitutional amendment does not apply to the effects of inflation increasing assessed valuation or any other similar effect that increases state revenue but which is not caused by an affirmative act of the legislature the enacted fiscal year  and  budgets did not provide for any increases in state revenues that required an approval from twothirds of the state legislature obligations of the state of arizona under the arizona constitution the states power to contract debt is limited to an amount of not more than  to supply casual deficits or failures in revenues or to meet expenses not otherwise provided for in addition to that authority the state may borrow money to repel invasion suppress insurrection or defend the state in time of war certain state agencies and instrumentalities may issue debt secured by limited special revenue sources additionally obligations such as leasepurchase agreements and certificates of participation that are subject to annual appropriation are not debt within the meaning of arizonas constitutional and statutory limitations as of june   various state agencies boards departments and instrumentalities including the department of transportation and state educational institutions had approximately  billion of bonded indebtedness certificates of participation of state agencies and instrumentalities

higher than budgeted expenditures resulting in a fund balance of approximately  million at year end total general fund revenues increased  from  billion for the fiscal year ended june   to  billion for the fiscal year ended june   during the same period the portion of general fund revenues derived from taxes increased  for the fiscal year ended june   total general fund expenditures were

and inspection and regulation natural resources and transportation approximately  change in accounting policy the states financial statements are currently prepared on a cash basis however the state is in the process of implementing an accrual basis reporting system which is required to conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap it is anticipated that the state will begin accrual basis reporting in addition to cash basis reporting during fiscal year   budget as of april   the states general fund revenues for fiscal year  were projected at  billion which is  more than budgeted general fund revenues for fiscal year  and  less than the actual general fund revenues collected for fiscal year  total general fund expenditures for fiscal year  were budgeted at  billion which is a  increase over budgeted general fund expenditures for fiscal year  and a  increase over the actual total general fund expenditures for fiscal year  this would result in a budgeted fund balance of approximately  million at the  fiscal year end spending decreases state legislation enacted in connection with the  budget is expected to cut spending in the following areas  million in education

made over a fouryear period beginning with approximately  million in tax refunds in fiscal year  obligations of other issuers assessment bonds municipal obligations which are assessment bonds or community facilities district bonds may be adversely affected by a general decline in real estate values or a slowdown in real estate sales activity in many cases such bonds are secured by land which is undeveloped at the time of issuance but anticipated to be developed within a few years after issuance in the event of such reduction or slowdown such development may not occur or may be delayed thereby increasing the risk of a default on the bonds the lien on the property is the only security for such bonds leasepurchase obligations certain arizona leasepurchase obligations though payable from the general fund of the municipality are subject to annual appropriation by the governing body of the municipality in amounts sufficient to pay the lease nonappropriation is legally not a default and there may be no adequate remedies available to the holders of the certificates evidencing the lease obligation in the event nonappropriation occurs other considerations the repayment of mortgage revenue bonds or other obligations secured by real property may be affected by laws limiting creditors rights and subject to the exercise of judicial discretion health care and hospital securities may be affected by changes in state regulations governing cost reimbursements to health care providers under ahcccs the states indigent health care program in recent years many cities towns and counties have experienced declines or slowing growth in the secondary assessed valuation causing a reduction or slower growth in property tax receipts and putting pressure on local budgets and capital improvement projects supported by such receipts municipalities are responding to these developments by a variety of methods including increasing the secondary property tax rate deferring property taxsupported bond projects and using other revenue sources to fund projects legislation has been or may be introduced which would modify existing taxes or other revenueraising measures it is not presently possible to predict the extent to which any such legislation will be enacted or if enacted how it would affect arizona municipal obligations special factors affecting puerto rico the following only highlights some of the more significant financial trends and problems affecting the commonwealth of puerto rico the commonwealth or puerto rico and is based on information drawn from official statements and prospectuses relating to the securities offerings of puerto rico its agencies and instrumentalities as available on the date of this statement of additional information fmr has not independently verified any of the information contained in such official statements prospectuses and other publicly available documents but is not aware of any fact which would render such information materially inaccurate the economy of puerto rico is closely linked with that of the united states and in fiscal  trade with the united states accounted for approximately  of puerto ricos exports and approximately  of its imports in this regard in fiscal  puerto rico experienced a  positive adjusted merchandise trade balance since fiscal  personal income both aggregate and per capita have increased consistently each fiscal year in fiscal  aggregate personal income was  billion and personal per capita income was  gross domestic product in fiscal    and  was    and  respectively for fiscal  an increase in gross domestic product of  over fiscal  is forecasted however actual growth in the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the us economy the exchange rate for the us dollar the price stability of oil imports and interest rates due to these factors there is no assurance that the economy of puerto rico will continue to grow puerto rico has made marked improvements in fighting unemployment unemployment is at a low level compared to that of the late s but it still remains significantly above the united states average despite long term improvements the unemployment rate rose from  to  from fiscal  to fiscal  at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  the unemployment rate in puerto rico stood at  there is a possibility that the unemployment rate will continue to increase the economy of puerto rico has undergone a transformation in the later half of this century from one centered around agriculture to one dominated by the manufacturing and service industries manufacturing is the cornerstone of puerto ricos economy accounting for  billion or  of gross domestic product in  however manufacturing has experienced a basic change over the years as a result of the influx of higher wage high technology industries such as the pharmaceutical industry electronics computers microprocessors scientific instruments and high technology machinery the service sector which includes wholesale and retail trade finance and real estate ranks second in its contribution to gross domestic product and is the sector that employs the greatest number of people in fiscal  the service sector generated  billion in gross domestic product or  of the total and employed over  workers providing  of total employment the government sector and tourism also contribute to the island economy each accounting for  billion and  billion in fiscal  respectively much of the development of the manufacturing sector of the economy of puerto rico is attributable to federal and commonwealth tax incentives most notably section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended section  and the commonwealths industrial incentives program section  currently grants us corporations that meet certain criteria and elect its application a credit against their us corporate income tax on the portion of the tax attributable to i income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business in puerto rico active income or from the sale or exchange of substantially all the assets used in the active conduct of such trade or business and ii qualified possession source investment income passive income the industrial incentives program through the  industrial incentives act grants corporations engaged in certain qualified activities a fixed  exemption from commonwealth income and property taxes and a  exemption from municipal license taxes on august   president clinton signed a bill amending section  under the amendments us corporations with operations in puerto rico can elect to receive a federal income tax credit equal to  of the credit currently available phased in over a five year period starting at  of the current credit or a credit based on investment and wages the investment and wage credit would equal the sum of i  of qualified compensation to employees ii a specified percentage of depreciation deductions with respect to tangible property located in puerto rico and iii a portion of income taxed paid to puerto rico up to a  effective tax rate subject to certain requirements it is not possible to determine at this time whether the reductions in tax incentives for operations in puerto rico will have a significant impact on the economy of puerto rico or the time period in which such impact would arise portfolio transactions all orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of the funds by fmr either directly or through affiliated subadvisers pursuant to authority contained in the management contracts with respect to the money market fund since fmr has granted investment management authority to the subadviser see the section entitled management contracts the subadviser is authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and will do so in accordance with the policies described below fmr is also responsible for the placement of transaction orders for other investment companies and accounts for which it or its affiliates act as investment adviser securities purchased and sold by the money market fund generally will be traded on a net basis ie without commission in selecting brokerdealers subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws fmr will consider various relevant factors including but not limited to the size and type of the transaction the nature and character of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold the execution efficiency settlement capability and financial condition of the brokerdealer firm the brokerdealers execution services rendered on a continuing basis and the reasonableness of any commissions the funds may execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers who provide research and execution services to the funds or other accounts over which fmr or its affiliates exercise investment discretion such services may include advice concerning the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities the availability of securities or the purchasers or sellers of securities furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and performance of accounts and effecting securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance and settlement fmr maintains a listing of brokerdealers who provide such services on a regular basis however as many transactions on behalf of the money market fund are placed with brokerdealers including brokerdealers on the list without regard to the furnishing of such services it is not possible to estimate the proportion of such transactions directed to such brokerdealers solely because such services were provided the selection of such brokerdealers is generally made by fmr to the extent possible consistent with execution considerations based upon the quality of research and execution services provided the receipt of research from brokerdealers that execute transactions on behalf of the funds may be useful to fmr in rendering investment management services to the funds or its other clients and conversely such research provided by brokerdealers who have executed transaction orders on behalf of other fmr clients may be useful to fmr in carrying out its obligations to the funds the receipt of such research has not reduced fmrs normal independent research activities however it enables fmr to avoid the additional expenses that could be incurred if fmr tried to develop comparable information through its own efforts subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws brokerdealers may receive commissions for agency transactions that are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other brokerdealers in recognition of their research and execution services in order to cause a fund to pay such higher commissions fmr must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such executing brokerdealers viewed in terms of a particular transaction or fmrs overall responsibilities to the funds and its other clients in reaching this determination fmr will not attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research services provided or to determine what portion of the compensation should be related to those services fmr is authorized to use research services provided by and to place portfolio transactions with brokerage firms that have provided assistance in the distribution of shares of the funds or shares of other fidelity funds to the extent permitted by law fmr may use research services provided by and place agency transactions with fidelity brokerage services inc fbsi a subsidiary of fmr corp if the commissions are fair reasonable and comparable to commissions charged by nonaffiliated qualified brokerage firms for similar services section a of the securities exchange act of  prohibits members of national securities exchanges from executing exchange transactions for accounts which they or their affiliates manage except if certain requirements are satisfied pursuant to such requirements the board of trustees has authorized fbsi to execute fund portfolio transactions on national securities exchanges in accordance with approved procedures and applicable sec rules each funds trustees periodically review fmrs performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by each fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund from time to time the trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the funds of some portion of the brokerage commissions or similar fees paid by the funds on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable each fund seeks to recapture soliciting brokerdealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect the trustees intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and if so to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for each fund to seek such recapture although the trustees and officers of the funds are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by fmr investment decisions for each fund are made independently from those of other funds managed by fmr or accounts managed by fmr affiliates it sometimes happens that the same security is held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or accounts simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and accounts are managed by the same investment adviser particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment objective of more than one fund or account when two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security the prices and amounts are allocated in accordance with a formula considered by the officers of the funds involved to be equitable to each fund in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as each fund is concerned in other cases however the ability of the funds to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the funds it is the current opinion of the board of trustees that the desirability of retaining fmr as investment adviser to each fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions valuation of portfolio securities income fund valuations of portfolio securities furnished by the pricing service employed by the fund are based upon a computerized matrix system or appraisals by the pricing service in each case in reliance upon information concerning market transactions and quotations from recognized municipal securities dealers the methods used by the pricing service and the quality of valuations so established are reviewed by officers of the fund and fsc under the general supervision of the board of trustees there are a number of pricing services available and the trustees or officers acting on behalf of the trustees on the basis of ongoing evaluation of these services may use other pricing services or discontinue the use of any pricing service in whole or in part money market fund the money market fund values its investments on the basis of amortized cost this technique involves valuing an instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount rather than its value based on current market quotations or appropriate substitutes which reflect current market conditions the amortized cost value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the price the fund would receive if it sold the instrument valuing the money market funds instruments on the basis of amortized cost and use of the term money market fund are permitted by rule a under the  act the fund must adhere to certain conditions under rule a the board of trustees of the fund oversees fmrs adherence to sec rules concerning money market funds and has established procedures designed to stabilize the funds nav at  at such intervals as they deem appropriate the trustees consider the extent to which nav calculated by using market valuations would deviate from  per share if the trustees believe that a deviation from the funds amortized cost per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders the trustees have agreed to take such corrective action if any as they deem appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent reasonably practicable the dilution or unfair results such corrective action could include selling portfolio instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity withholding dividends redeeming shares in kind establishing nav by using available market quotations and such other measures as the trustees may deem appropriate during periods of declining interest rates the money market funds yield based on amortized cost may be higher than the yield based on market valuations under these circumstances a shareholder in the fund would be able to obtain a somewhat higher yield than would result if the fund utilized market valuations to determine its nav the converse would apply in a period of rising interest rates performance the funds may quote performance in various ways all performance information supplied by the funds in advertising is historical and is not intended to indicate future returns the income funds share price and each funds yields and total returns fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors and the value of the income funds shares when redeemed may be more or less than their original cost yield calculations to compute the money market funds yield for a period the net change in value of a hypothetical account containing one share reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from the one original share and dividends declared on both the original share and any additional shares the net change is then divided by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return this base period return is annualized to obtain a current annualized yield the money market fund also may calculate a compound effective yield by compounding the base period return over a oneyear period in addition to the current yield the money market fund may quote yields in advertising based on any historical sevenday period yields for the money market fund are calculated on the same basis as other money market funds as required by regulation for the income fund yields used in advertising are computed by dividing the funds interest income for a given day or onemonth period net of expenses by the average number of shares entitled to receive dividends during the period dividing this figure by the funds net asset value per share at the end of the period and annualizing the result assuming compounding of income in order to arrive at an annual percentage rate yields do not reflect the funds  redemption fee which applies to shares held less than  days income is calculated for purposes of the funds yield quotations in accordance with standardized methods applicable to all stock and bond funds in general interest income is reduced with respect to bonds trading at a premium over their par value by subtracting a portion of the premium from income on a daily basis and is increased with respect to bonds trading at a discount by adding a portion of the discount to daily income capital gains and losses generally are excluded from the calculation income calculated for the purposes of calculating the income funds yield differs from income as determined for other accounting purposes because of the different accounting methods used and because of the compounding of income assumed in yield calculations the income funds yield may not equal its distribution rate the income paid to your account or the income reported in the funds financial statements a funds taxequivalent yield is the rate an investor would have to earn from a fully taxable investment after taxes to equal the funds taxfree yield taxequivalent yields are calculated by dividing a funds yield by the result of one minus a stated federal or combined federal and state tax rate if only a portion of the funds yield is taxexempt only that portion is adjusted in the calculation the following tables show the effect of a shareholders tax status on the effective yield under federal and state income tax laws for  they show the approximate yield a taxable security must provide at various income brackets to produce aftertax yields equivalent to those of taxexempt obligations yielding from  to  of course no assurance can be given that the funds will achieve any specific taxexempt yield while the funds invest principally in obligations whose interest is exempt from federal and state income tax other income received by the funds may be taxable the funds do not take into account local taxes if any payable on

are  federally and state taxfree total return calculations total returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of a funds returns including the effect of reinvesting dividends and capital gain distributions and any change in the funds nav over a stated period average annual total returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in a fund over a stated period and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period for example a cumulative total return of  over ten years would produce an average annual return of  which is the steady annual rate that would equal  growth on a compounded basis in ten years average annual returns covering periods less than one year are calculated by determining a funds total return for the period extending that return for a full year assuming that return remains constant over the year and quoting the result as an annual return while average annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment alternatives investors should realize that a funds performance is not constant over time but changes from year to year and that average annual total returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual yeartoyear performance of the fund in addition to average annual returns a fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative total returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment over a stated period average annual and cumulative total returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount and may be calculated for a single investment a series of investments or a series of redemptions over any time period total returns may be broken down into their components of income and capital including capital gains and changes in share price in order to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to total return total returns may be quoted on a beforetax or aftertax basis and may or may not include the income funds  redemption fee on shares held less than  days excluding the redemption fee from a total return calculation produces a higher total return figure omitting fees and charges will cause the funds total return figures to be higher total returns yields and other performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table graph or similar illustration and may omit or include the effects of each funds  account closeout fee net asset value charts and graphs using a funds net asset value adjusted net asset values and benchmark indices may be used to exhibit performance an adjusted nav includes any distributions paid by a fund and reflects all elements of its return unless otherwise indicated a funds adjusted navs are not adjusted for sales charges if any each fund may compare its return to the record of the standard amp poors  composite stock price index sampp registered trademark the dow jones industrial average djia and the cost of living measured by the consumer price index or cpi over the same period the sampp  and djia comparisons would show how each funds total return compared to the record of a broad average of common stocks and a narrower set of stocks of major industrial companies respectively over the same period of course since the income fund invests in fixedincome securities and the money market fund invests in shortterm fixedincome securities common stocks represent a different type of investment from the fund common stocks generally offer greater growth potential than the fund but generally experience greater price volatility which means greater potential for loss in addition common stocks generally provide lower income than a fixedincome investment such as the funds figures for the sampp  and djia are based on the prices of unmanaged groups of stocks and unlike the funds returns their returns do not include the effect of paying brokerage commissions or other costs of investing a funds performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual funds in general or to the performance of particular types of mutual funds these comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings prepared by lipper analytical services inc lipper an independent service located in summit new jersey that monitors the performance of mutual funds lipper generally ranks funds on the basis of total return assuming reinvestment of distributions but does not take sales charges or redemption fees into consideration and is prepared without regard to tax consequences lipper may also rank funds based on yield in addition to the mutual fund rankings a funds performance may be compared to stock bond and money market mutual fund performance indices prepared by lipper or other organizations when comparing these indices it is important to remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment for example while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility likewise money market funds may offer greater stability of principal but generally do not offer the higher potential returns from stock mutual funds from time to time a funds performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and periodicals for example the fund may quote morningstar inc in its advertising materials morningstar inc is a mutual fund rating service that rates mutual funds on the basis of riskadjusted performance rankings that compare the performance of fidelity funds to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising a fund may be compared in advertising to certificates of deposit cds or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects for example a fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than cds the fund does not guarantee your principal or your return and fund shares are not fdic insured fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals

investors should consider the relevant differences in investment objectives and policies specifically money market funds invest in shortterm highquality instruments and seek to maintain a stable  share price the income fund however invests in longerterm instruments and its share price changes daily in response to a variety of factors the income fund may compare and contrast in advertising the relative advantages of investing in a mutual fund versus an individual municipal bond unlike taxfree mutual funds individual municipal bonds offer a stated rate of interest and if held to maturity repayment of principal although some individual municipal bonds might offer a higher return they do not offer the reduced risk of a mutual fund that invests in many different securities the initial

effects of periodic investment plans including the principle of dollar cost averaging in such a program an investor invests a fixed dollar amount in a fund at periodic intervals thereby purchasing fewer shares when prices are high and more shares when prices are low while such a strategy does not assure a profit or guard against loss in a declining market the investors average cost per share can be lower than if fixed numbers of shares are purchased at the same intervals in evaluating such a plan investors should consider their ability to continue purchasing shares during periods of low

has adopted a distribution and service plan the plan under rule b of the investment company act of  the rule the rule provides in substance that a mutual fund may not engage directly or indirectly in financing any activity that is primarily intended to result in the sale of shares of the fund except pursuant to a plan adopted by the fund under the rule each funds board of trustees has adopted the plan to allow the fund and fmr to incur certain expenses that might be considered to constitute indirect payment by the fund of distribution expenses under the plan if the payment of management fees by the fund to fmr is deemed to be indirect financing by the fund of the distribution of its shares such payment is authorized by the plan each plan specifically recognizes that fmr either directly or through fdc may use its management fee revenues past profits or other resources without limitation to pay promotional and administrative expenses in connection with the offer and sale of shares of the fund in addition each plan provides that fmr may use its resources including its management fee revenues to make payments to third parties that provide assistance in selling shares of the fund or to third parties including banks that render shareholder support services the trustees have not authorized such payments to date each funds plan has been approved by the trustees as required by the rule the trustees carefully considered all pertinent factors relating to implementation of each plan prior to its approval and have determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the plan will benefit the fund and its shareholders in particular the trustees noted that each plan does not authorize payments by the fund other than those made to fmr under its management contract with the fund

each fund on   the glasssteagall act generally prohibits federally and state chartered or supervised banks from engaging in the business of underwriting selling or distributing securities although the scope of this prohibition under the glasssteagall act has not been clearly defined by the courts or appropriate regulatory agencies fdc believes that the glasssteagall act should not preclude a bank from performing shareholder support services or servicing and recordkeeping functions fdc intends to engage banks only to perform such functions however changes in federal or state statutes and regulations pertaining to the permissible activities of banks and their affiliates or subsidiaries as well as further judicial or administrative decisions or interpretations could prevent a bank from continuing to perform all or a part of the contemplated services if a bank were prohibited from so acting the trustees would consider what actions if any would be necessary to continue to provide efficient and effective shareholder services in such event changes in the operation of the funds might occur including possible termination of any automatic investment or redemption or other services then provided by the bank it is not expected that shareholders would suffer any adverse financial consequences as a result of any of these occurrences each fund may execute portfolio transactions with and purchase securities issued by depository institutions that receive payments under the plan no preference for the instruments of such depository institutions will be shown in the selection of investments in addition state securities laws on this issue may differ from the interpretations of federal law expressed herein and banks and other financial institutions may be required to register

organized on july   fdc is a brokerdealer registered under the securities exchange act of  and is a member of the national association of securities dealers inc the distribution agreement calls for fdc to use all reasonable efforts consistent with its other business to secure purchasers for shares of each fund which are continuously offered at net asset value promotional and administrative

investment company organized as a massachusetts business trust on march   on april   the board of trustees voted to change the name of the trust from fidelity daily income trust to fidelity union street trust currently there are eight funds of the massachusetts trust fidelity export company fund spartan aggressive municipal fund spartan ginnie mae fund spartan intermediate municipal fund spartan maryland municipal income fund spartan municipal income portfolio spartan shortintermediate municipal fund and spartan arizona municipal income portfolio the massachusetts trusts declaration of trust permits the trustees to create additional funds fidelity union street trust ii the delaware trust is an openend management investment company organized as a delaware business trust on june   currently there four funds of the delaware trust fidelity daily income trust spartan municipal money fund spartan world money market fund and spartan arizona municipal money market portfolio the delaware trusts trust instrument permits the trustees to create additional funds in the event that fmr ceases to be investment adviser to a trust or any of its funds the right of the trust or the fund to use the identifying names fidelity and spartan may be withdrawn there is a remote possibility that one fund might become liable for any misstatement in its prospectus or statement of additional information about another fund the assets of each trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each of its funds and all income earnings profits and proceeds thereof subject only to the rights of creditors are especially allocated to such fund and constitute the underlying assets of such fund the underlying assets of each fund are segregated on the books of account and are to be charged with the liabilities with respect to such fund and with a share of the general liabilities of their respective trusts expenses with respect to each trust are to be allocated in proportion to the asset value of their respective funds except where allocations of direct expense can otherwise be fairly made the officers of the trusts subject to the general supervision of the board of trustees have the power to determine which expenses are allocable to a given fund or which are general or allocable to all of the funds of a certain trust in the event of the dissolution or liquidation of a trust shareholders of each fund of that trust are entitled to receive as a class the underlying assets of such fund available for distribution shareholder and trustee liability  massachusetts trust the massachusetts trust is an entity of the type commonly known as a massachusetts business trust under massachusetts law shareholders of such a trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust the declaration of trust provides that the massachusetts trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of shares and requires that each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or its trustees shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the massachusetts trust and its assets the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of each funds property of any shareholders held personally liable for the obligations of the fund the declaration of trust also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which the fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations fmr believes that in view of the above the risk of personal liability to shareholders is remote the declaration of trust further provides that the trustees if they have exercised reasonable care will not be liable for any neglect or wrongdoing but nothing in the declaration of trust protects trustees against any liability to which they would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of their office shareholder and trustee liability  delaware trust the delaware trust is a business trust organized under delaware law delaware law provides that shareholders shall be entitled to the same limitations of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit the courts of some states however may decline to apply delaware law on this point the trust instrument contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts liabilities obligations and expenses of the delaware trust and requires that a disclaimer be given in each contract entered into or executed by the delaware trust or its trustees the trust instrument provides for indemnification out of each funds property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the fund the trust instrument also provides that each fund shall upon request assume the defense of any claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which delaware law does not apply no contractual limitation of liability was in effect and the fund is unable to meet its obligations fmr believes that in view of the above the risk of personal liability to shareholders is extremely remote the trust instrument further provides that the trustees shall not be personally liable to any person other than the delaware trust or its shareholders moreover the trustees shall not be liable for any conduct whatsoever provided that trustees are not protected against any liability to which they would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of their office voting rights  both trusts each funds capital consists of shares of beneficial interest as a shareholder of the massachusetts trust you receive one vote for each dollar value of net asset value per share you own the shares have no preemptive or conversion rights

any fund may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to or in the case of the delaware trust and its funds merger with another openend management investment company or series thereof or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets generally such terminations must be approved by vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the trust or the fund for the delaware trust or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the trust or fund as determined by the current value of each shareholders investment in the trust or fund for the massachusetts trust however the trustees of the delaware trust may without prior shareholder approval change the form of the organization of the delaware trust by merger consolidation or incorporation if not so terminated or reorganized the trusts and their funds will continue indefinitely under the trust instrument the trustees may without shareholder vote cause the delaware trust to merge or consolidate into one or more trusts

trust to be incorporated under delaware law each fund of the massachusetts and delaware business trusts may also invest all of its assets in another investment company custodian united missouri bank na  grand avenue kansas city missouri  is custodian of the assets of the funds the custodian is responsible for the safekeeping of the funds assets and the appointment of subcustodian banks and clearing agencies the custodian takes no part in determining the investment policies of the funds or in deciding which securities are purchased or sold by the funds the funds may however invest in obligations of the custodian and may purchase securities from or sell securities to the custodian fmr its officers and directors its affiliated companies and the trusts trustees may from time to time have transactions with various banks including banks serving as custodian for certain of the funds advised by fmr transactions that have occurred to date include mortgages and personal and general business loans in the judgment of fmr the terms and conditions of those transactions were not influenced by existing or potential custodial or other fund relationships auditor  serves as each trusts independent accountant the auditor examines financial statements for the funds and provides other audit tax and related services appendix dollarweighted average maturity is derived by multiplying the value of each investment by the number of days remaining to its maturity adding these calculations and then dividing the total by the value of the funds portfolio an obligations maturity is typically determined on a stated final maturity basis although there are some exceptions to this rule for example if it is probable that the issuer of an instrument will take advantage of a maturityshortening device such as a call refunding or redemption provision the date on which the instrument will probably be called refunded or redeemed may be considered to be its maturity date when a municipal bond issuer has committed to call an issue of bonds and has established an independent escrow account that is sufficient to and is pledged to refund that issue the number of days to maturity for the prerefunded bond is considered to be the number of days to the announced call date of the bonds the descriptions that follow are examples of eligible ratings for the income fund the funds may however consider ratings for other types of investments and the ratings assigned by other ratings organizations when determining the eligibility of a particular investment description of moodys investors service incs ratings of state and municipal notes moodys ratings for state and municipal and other shortterm obligations will be designated moodys investment grade mig or vmig for variable rate obligations this distinction is in recognition of the difference between shortterm credit risk and longterm credit risk factors affecting the liquidity of the borrower and shortterm cyclical elements are critical in shortterm ratings while other factors of major importance in bond risk longterm secular trends for example may be less important in the short run symbols used will be as follows migvmig  this designation denotes best quality there is present strong protection by established cash flows superior liquidity support or demonstrated broadbased access to the market for refinancing migvmig  this designation denotes high quality margins of protection are ample although not so large as in the preceding group migvmig  this designation denotes favorable quality with all security elements accounted for but there is lacking the undeniable strength of the preceding grades liquidity and cash flow protection may be narrow and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well established migvmig  this designation denotes adequate quality protection commonly regarded as required of an investment security is present and although not distinctly or predominantly speculative there is specific risk description of standard amp poors corporations ratings of state and municipal notes sp  very strong or strong capacity to pay principal and interest those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics will be given a plus  designation sp  satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest sp  speculative capacity to pay principal and interest description of moodys investors service incs municipal bond ratings aaa  bonds rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa  bonds rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with aaa group they comprise what are generally known as highgrade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities a  bonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as uppermediumgrade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa  bonds rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well ba  bonds rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times in the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class b  bonds rated b generally lack characteristics of a desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments of or maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small caa  bonds rated caa are of poor standing such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest those bonds in the aa a baa ba and b groups which moodys believes possess the strongest investment attributes are designated by the symbols aa a baa ba and b description of standard amp poors corporations municipal bond ratings aaa  debt rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard amp poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aa  debt rated aa has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differs from the highestrated debt issues only in small degree a  debt rated a has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions bbb  debt rated bbb is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higherrated categories bb  debt rated bb has less nearterm vulnerability to default than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments b  debt rated b has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or willingness to pay interest and repay principal the b rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied bb or bb rating ccc  debt rated ccc has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions to meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions it is not likely to have the capacity to pay interest and repay principal the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus to show relative standing within the major rating

commission  f street ne washington dc  applicants  devonshire street boston massachusetts  for further information contact laura j riegel senior counsel at   or dalia osman blass assistant director at   division of investment management office of investment company regulation supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgovsearchsearchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  each trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of massachusetts or delaware as applicable each trust is registered under the act as an openend management investment company fmr co sai or another fmr entity serves as investment adviser or subadviser to each of the funds fmr co and sai are investment advisers registered under the investment advisers act of  “advisers act” any investment adviser to the funds will be registered under the advisers act  the prior order permits the funds to participate in a credit facility administered by fmr the “ifl program” the ifl program enables the funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels the ifl program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the funds and enhance the lending funds ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their shortterm balances the prior order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the ifl program the “ifl rate” be based on the average of a the higher of the overnight time deposit rate the “otd rate” and the funds current overnight repurchase agreement rate the “ficash rate”  and b a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the funds “benchmark rate” the board of trustees each a “fund board” and collectively the “fund boards” of each fund including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons” as defined in section a of the act “independent trustees” establishes the benchmark rate and reviews no less frequently than annually the continuing appropriateness of the benchmark rate the benchmark rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the federal funds rate over the previous  days  applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary therefore applicants seek to amend the prior order to eliminate the use of the otd rate in the ifl rate calculation provided in conditions  and  “rate conditions” applicants also request an exemption from section a of the act applicants legal analysis  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated person of an affiliated person from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company section b of the act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person directly or indirectly if that person controls or is under common control with that company section ac of the act defines an “affiliated person” of another person in part to be any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with such other person section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds applicants state that each fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other funds and therefore an affiliated person of those funds  section a of the act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from selling securities or other property to the investment company section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such a person from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company section d of the act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section  section f of the act prohibits registered openend investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank if immediately after the borrowing there is asset coverage of at least  per centum for all borrowings of the company under section g of the act the term “senior security” generally includes any bond debenture note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a provided that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the act section c of the act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section dj of the act provides that the commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section d if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors  section d of the act and rule d under the act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of an affiliated person when acting as principal from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the commission rule db provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule the commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which the companys participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants request an order under a section c of the act granting an exemption from sections f and b of the act b section dj of the act granting an exemption from section d of the act c sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a a and a of the act and d section d of the act and rule d under the act to permit certain joint arrangements the requested order would amend the rate conditions in the prior order and grant applicants an exemption from section a of the act  as noted previously applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the otd rate in calculation of the ifl rate unnecessary applicants state further that the ifl rate as amended would make it more likely that lending funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the ifl program if the ifl rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate applicants state that the rate conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity  applicants also state that the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions will not involve any potential that one fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another fund applicants state that under the ifl program as modified by the rate conditions rates will be set under a preestablished formula approved by the fund boards applicants state that all funds participating in the ifl program as revised by the rate conditions on any given day will receive the same interest rate  applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the rate conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the act and meet the standards set forth in sections c dj b and d of the act and rule d under the act applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the rate conditions would be reasonable and fair would not involve overreaching and would be consistent with the investment policies of the funds and with the general purposes of the act applicants submit further that each funds participation in the ifl program would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be on a basis which is no different from or less advantageous than that of any other participant applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the ifl rate to be charged to the funds under the ifl program will be the average of a the ficash rate and b the benchmark rate  on each business day the cash management services department “cash management department” of fidelity service company inc will compare the ifl rate calculated as provided in condition  with the ficash rate that day and all shortterm borrowing rates quoted to any of the funds by any bank with which any fund has a loan agreement at least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any fund borrows through the
