alone as the only theatre operating continuously as a theatre since it opened in  the significance of this fact cannot be overstated the history of walnut street theatre is in large measure the history of theatre in america every noteworthy american actor of the th century and many from the th century not to mention famous actors from other countries appeared on stage at walnut street theatre just as it stands today some of the walnuts shining stars include edwin booth edwin forrest helen hayes houdini george m cohan edward g robinson george c scott jack lemmon mike nichols claudette colbert jane fonda julie harris katharine hepburn ethel waters and jessica tandy philadelphians are justly proud of the many firsts associated with their city but not many of them are aware of the firsts in the arts that occurred at walnut street theatre the rivals was staged here in  in attendance were president thomas jefferson and the marquis de lafayette over the years the walnut has been the home of many theatrical innovations in  it was the first theatre to install gas footlights and in  the walnut became the first theatre to install air conditioning the first copyright law protecting american plays has its roots at the walnut edwin booth brother of john wilkes booth purchased the walnut in  two months after president lincoln was assassinated in  groucho marx stopped his act on the walnut stage to tell the audience that president warren harding had died from  to  walnut street theatre was owned by the shubert organization and was the site of numerous memorable prebroadway tryouts these include a streetcar named desire with marlon brando  mr roberts starring henry fonda  gigi with audrey hepburn  the diary of anne frank with susan strasburg  a raisin in the sun starring sidney poitier  and a man for all seasons starring paul scofield  in  the walnut was designated a national historic landmark later it was the site of the first presidential debate between gerald ford and jimmy carter in  a nonprofit corporation was formed to purchase and renovate the theatre this led to the preservation of the th century facade just as it appeared on walnut street in  through the s walnut street theatre became mainly a performing arts center that hosted programs produced by other organizations by  it was clear that this approach was not economically feasible a new direction would have to be tried or walnut street theatre after  years would have to close clearly the walnut had arrived at a crossroads never in its history had it been so threatened with extinction a number of community leaders led by ed rome made a decision to search for a new executive director after a nationwide search bernard havard was interviewed and persuaded the board to return the walnut to a producing theatre havard was hired and a full season of plays was produced on the mainstage during the  season with vision and inspirational leadership walnut street theatre was reconceived as a nonprofit regional theatre dedicated to the preservation and development of the art of theatre this distinction sets walnut street theatre apart from most of its similarlysized peers in the region which are commercial theatres formed to return a profit to their owners they do not produce their own plays but simply present productions that have originated elsewhere as a nonprofit theatre the walnut chooses and produces its own productions handcrafted right here in philadelphia it does this not to make a profit but to entertain enlighten and educate the people of the delaware valley and to preserve this historic landmarks legacy since  walnut street theatre has produced over  plays including  world premieres and  american premieres the walnut street theatre school was established in  and has provided theatre instruction selfimprovement and a deepened appreciation of the art form through its outreach programs and classes to over  children and adults annually the studio  series was initiated in  to provide more adventurous theatre experiences to theatregoers and to broaden the scope of theatre produced by the walnut in  through a grant from the independence foundation the theatre was renovated to become the independence studio on  additionally walnut street theatre has supported the local arts community acting as an incubator for other theatre companies in the early stages of their development indeed the measure of success at walnut street theatre can be taken not only by the full houses that enjoy programs on its mainstage but also by the attendance at other theatre and performing arts venues throughout our community a study conducted by ziff marketing commissioned by the pew charitable trust identifies walnut street theatre as an entry point for a large prospect market interested in attending the theatre in the philadelphia area philadelphians and diverse audiences from across the greater philadelphia region have rallied to the walnut subscription audiences have grown from  in  to over  today annual attendance exceeds  making walnut street theatre a critical link between the citys commercial center and the historic district during the summer of  walnut street theatre completed a number of projects to enhance artistry and preserve the historic building one of these projects was the restoration of its yearold mainstage grid in a theatre a grid is a structure comprised of boards and beams that is suspended from the roof of the building over the stage this grid then serves as the support structure from which key theatrical elements are hung including stage curtains pieces of scenery lighting equipment and sound equipment during the months of july and august all of the old worn wooden beams were replaced steel reinforcement was added and all of the mechanisms used to move scenery on and off stage was upgraded this made the walnut safer allowed freedom to install more elaborate sets and preserved the integrity of the worlds oldest continuously operating theatre this project was supported jointly by a grant from the pennsylvania historical and museum commission and the helen groome beatty trust a second project was the upgrading of mainstage lighting this project optimized lighting safety and efficiency and gave greater freedom to employ more creative lighting techniques this project was made possible in part by a cultural economic development grant these grants are funded by the delaware river port authority with administrative support provided by the greater philadelphia cultural

ashok n bakhru president abn associates po box  lima pennsylvania  march   jonathan g katz secretary us securities and exchange commission  fifth street nw washington dc  re investment company governance sec file no s dear mr katz this letter is submitted in response to a request for comment by the securities and exchange commission you on proposed regulatory changes these changes are intended to enhance the independence and effectiveness of investment company directors and to improve their ability to protect the interests of the registered investment companies funds and fund shareholders they serve the proposed changes are published in release no ic jan   this letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned and the other independent trustees of goldman sachs trust and goldman sachs variable insurance trust two openend management investment companies consisting of  separate portfolios with assets of approximately  billion the funds see sec registration nos  and  you have proposed five principal regulatory changes to strengthen the independence of fund directors as well as a sixth change relating to the retention of certain records our comments on the proposed regulatory changes are as follows board composition we support the proposal to require that independent directors constitute a supermajority of a fund board which in our view could be either twothirds or seventyfive percent of the board we also believe if you adopt a supermajority requirement that funds should be allowed at least eighteen months to comply with the requirement independent chairman of the board we support the proposal to require that the chairman of a fund board be an independent director we have had an independent chairman of the board for more than ten years it has been our experience that the chairman can provide an important and meaningful role in the preparation of board agenda and in fostering the dialogue between fund management and the independent directors on fundrelated matters with regards to your specific question whether an independent director is able to lead effectively the board through a discussion of a detailed and complex agenda our response is yes independent directors are fully capable in this regard moreover if a particular independent directorchairman is unable to lead board discussions effectively it is likely that other independent directors will be able to serve capably as the chairman these views are also equally shared by management of our funds on the other hand with regards to your specific question whether the chairman of all board committees should also be required to be an independent director our response is no we believe that there are certain committees such as dividend committees and valuation committees where it is unnecessary to require that the chairman be independent annual selfassessment we support the proposal to require fund directors to perform an evaluation at least annually of the effectiveness of the board and its committees we have been performing annual selfassessments for five years and have found that the selfassessments have both strengthened our fund governance and have facilitated the dialogue among independent board members nonindependent board members and fund management we believe however that all selfassessments must be held in strictest confidence to promote full and frank responses we are therefore uncertain whether we agree completely with your stated expectation that the minutes of the board of directors should reflect the substance of the matters discussed during the boards selfassessment and we hope you will consider this point further with regards to your question whether you should restrict the number of fund boards on which a director serves our response is no we believe that the appropriate number of fund boards on which a director serves should be considered in a boards selfassessment based on relevant circumstances and facts and should not be determined by a commission rule moreover we strongly support the practice of using pooled board structures as it leads to efficiencies in addressing issues common across a fund complex our experience has borne this out separate sessions we support the proposal that independent directors be required to meet at least quarterly in a separate session at which no interested persons of the fund are present except fund counsel the independent members of the funds board of trustees and certain board committees such as the audit committee meet regularly in executive session without management or the interested trustees present we believe these sessions have helped strengthen collaboration and teamwork among the noninterested trustees and our ability to consider the matters presented to the board and the committees for review or action we also believe however that it is unnecessary to require by regulation that separate sessions be held more frequently than quarterly so long as the independent trustees have the discretion to do so independent director staff we support the proposal that funds explicitly authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties the funds board of trustees and certain committees such as the audit committee and the governance and nominating committee already have this authority in addition the board of trustees utilizes the services of the funds independent auditors and independent legal counsel and in accordance with rule a under the  act has selected a chief compliance officer for the funds in these circumstances we do not believe that you should require independent directors to hire their own staff other matters in addition to our comments on your specific proposals we note that in your release publishing these proposals you recognize that funds meet the investment needs and fulfill the expectations of their shareholders because of the efforts and skill of their investment advisers and that investors do not generally invest in a fund because of the skill or reputation of its board of directors you also observed however that oversight by a funds board of directors is critical because of the unique set of conflicts the investment adviser has with a fund as you proceed with the proposals discussed in this letter as well as your other regulatory initiatives we ask that you continue to recognize that your rules need to strike the proper balance between the responsibilities of management and the oversight responsibilities of fund directors thank you for this opportunity to comment on your proposals we hope our thoughts are constructive sincerely yours s ashok n bakhru ashok n bakhru chairman of the board and independent trustee goldman
