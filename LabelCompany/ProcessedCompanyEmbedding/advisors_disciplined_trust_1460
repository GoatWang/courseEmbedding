to provide federal taxexempt income and to preserve capital on the date of deposit the bonds included in an insured municipals income trust have been rated at least a by standard  poors or rated at least a by moodys investors service inc or if not rated as of the date of deposit are insured by a bond insurer rated at least a by standard  poors or rated at least a by moodys while no representation is made as to the insurers ability to meet its commitments this rating is due to the claimspaying ability of the insurers that provide coverage on the bonds in the trusts portfolio not on units of the trust for further details as to the terms and limitations of the insurance please consult a prospectus  a portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes  due to the nature of municipal bonds there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity potentially below the par value of the bond and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same
