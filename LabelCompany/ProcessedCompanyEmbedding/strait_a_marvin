reuben saltzman february   — am text size comment share tweet email print more share on share on linkedin share on google share on pinterest copy shortlink purchase order reprint this is a guest blog post by ryan carey of my  quotes how important is a wellknown name brand for you that is a big question and the answer greatly affects our buying decisions for example when several inhome window presentations by highpressure salespeople are giving you a headache do you get generic ibuprofen or do you pay a little extra for advil the generic brand shows the same percentage of ingredients but this is a huge headache so maybe its best to be on the safe side over the years the most common question i get is so how does this window compare against andersen marvin or pella i could show the comparable ingredients or the same ufactors but some folks are just more comfortable with that wellknown name brand they know the manufacturer has been around for a long time and therefore has made many customers happy they are also concerned about the company being around in the future for warranty issues if you read window replacement part  you know how important i believe that ufactors are in new windows in part  i went through the pros and cons of different window materials and install methods for part  we will focus on the big  marvin andersen and pella i will even add a  for weather shield you wont normally hear unbiased opinions on these windows because typically the person doing the writing has a particular window they are trying to sell to begin on the straight talk i just want to say every one of these companies windows were pretty awful in the s s and even into the s before low e argon filled glass came along this had not as much to do with them as it did with the struggle of finding a wood interior window that worked with the new technology of double pane glass and aluminum spacers every company had issues with that hardwood was no longer being used for windows it was mostly soft quickgrowth pine the two panes of clear glass were separated by an aluminum spacer on the perimeter which transferred in the cold from the outside because the aluminum is very conductive that area would develop condensation freeze thaw and destroy the wood where it meets the glass sometimes the water got into the frame and completely rotted it out i kept running into the same thing with homeowners if their windows from that era were marvin they hated marvin and would never use them again if they had andersen they hated andersen and would never use them again if they had pella or weather shield well you can guess this is why you will find a lot of negative reviews about every kind of window out there unless the homeowner had very good humidity control the customer was in for trouble with wood windows from that era in our state many negative reviews also were the result of bad installs times have changed spacers have changed to less conductive stainless steel ushaped tin steel and foam polymers my personal favoritevirtually no conduction of cold lowe and argon glass has also hindered temperature transfer and greatly cut down uv rays that help damage the wood while the performances have greatly improved and the wood will last longer i still refuse to put a real wood window with any type of metal spacer in my house even if it is just a little maintenance from time to time with some steel wool and varnish it is more than i want to do many people love real wood and feel different than me on that topic times have also changed with the window market back in the day these big window brands were mainly new construction and none of them used to custom size for remodel openings times were so good they would actually tell customers you alter your openings to fit our windows needless to say they have all jumped headlong into the customsized replacement window market at this point marvin it shouldnt be a surprise that marvin and andersen are the most asked for windows from customers considering both companies reside here in minnesota pella iowa and weather shield wisconsin are a ways back in the second tier maybe its the thought of hawkeye badger or packer fans making windows for your house while people do like to buy from home state companies the window quality and reputation certainly play their roles as well  marvin has been making windows since the s and they have changed along with the times their original double pane wood window is clad with aluminum on the exterior they have also gone to fiberglass on the exterior with their integrity line real wood interior and they make infinity an allfiberglass line that has an option for a stainable interior not real wood marvin is the one company out of all mentioned that have completely refused to use vinyl in any window line so they pitch strongly against it their ultimate double hung is a beautiful window and the price reflects it im a big fan of marvin i believe in the craftsmanship of their entire product line if i had to choose one of their windows i would go for infinity fiberglass is as good as it gets couple it with their everwood interior for the look and stainability of wood without actually having to worry about wood decay and you have me sold it is definitely on the high end of pricing as you would expect from a highend option my only regret with marvin is that they still use metal spacers which keeps me from recommending their realwood lines andersen andersen is the only company of the ones were discussing that uses wood wrapped in vinyl on the exterior the wood strengthens the vinyl leaving an exterior that is low maintenance yet rigid andersens top line the  series is highend priced as well i would take a marvin over andersen in the double hung department i like the traditional look but i would take the andersen casement over a realwood marvin they wrap the entire sash the part that cranks out in vinyl so there is no trouble spot of wood against glass you do see the outline of vinyl on the interior but the profile is narrow enough that most people dont mind its well worth it to avoid the potential wood decay andersen also makes an all vinyl wrapped patio door in their permashield line if you want to avoid exposed wood on the interior so what about andersen renewal talk about a company that advertises everywhere renewal by andersen is its own company separate but obviously owned by the main company renewal products are made from a composite material called fibrex which is part wood and part vinyl this is very smart by andersen as they use up all the byproducts of their other lines which are made of wood and vinyl separately renewal products are not available to contractors like their other lines you must purchase the install straight from renewal they feature a more rounded contemporary look and customers ive ran across have been very positive on the product in their home they offer stainable interiors or the lowmaintenance fibrex with pricing being quite highend always remember this never tell a salesperson from another company that youre also getting a quote from renewal even if you are almost every salesperson knows where renewal is priced so this tells them they can price their own product higher than normal yet still be less than renewal just tell them you are getting several quotes and leave it at that   andersen  series is a very intriguing window line some call it renewal lite since it is also made of fibrex the only option is a white interior so that takes some people out of the mix right off the bat however if white on the inside is ok by you this is the absolute best opportunity to get a big name window at a noname window price i love their sliders and casements the one caveat is their singlehung that thing is a nightmare since the top sash is stationary it is called a single hung not a double hung thats not the problem the problem is it doesnt have the typical tiltout feature for cleaning it has a metal peg that you flip out before lifting the sash up when the sash goes up the peg should push the sash out of the frame for cleaning but many times the peg flies out instead if you dont need to clean from the inside then dont worry about it if you do stick with the sliders and casements and youll get a great value pella well pella certainly took a were not fooling around approach to jumping into the remodel market they make three series of wood windows with aluminum cladding a fiberglass line and three levels of all vinyl windows on the vinyl side they can be judged right along with other vinyl windows with the bonus that they carry the pella name my advice remains the same as with other vinylcheck the uvalue stick with the top level they offer and youll be happy they also make an allfiberglass window in impervia with solid color interiors available   pella makes a finely detailed wood line called the architectural series which is a wellcrafted window with a higher price tag their designer series is optionfriendly and one of the only lines that has really perfected the blinds between the glass panes option if you want blinds in your glass instead of on the inside of your home this is the best line for you pellas entry level wood window is proline which i am not a fan of whatsoever a small space between the glass along with an aluminum spacer means bad news for the wood ive seen these windows in tough shape after ten years even with the low e glass if you like pella and want wood interior pay the extra for architectural or designer i also have to bring up pellas patio door lines they are wellmade but they are the only company ive ever seen that puts the patio screen on the inside not the outside they say this protects the abuse of an exterior track and they put a nice wood finish on the screen but it is impractical for its main use keeping bugs out imagine a summer night where you have  mosquitoes on your screen thirsting for your blood like a pack of zombies when its time for bed you have to open the screen to close the outside panel of the patio door then quick close the screen again so they dont all get in now they are all trapped between the two panels ill never get that design weather shield   why am i bringing up weather shield not exactly a big name compared to the other three with the big advertising budgets however i bring them up because they have embraced the foam spacer technology while the others havent i mentioned i wouldnt put a wood window with a metal spacer in my house well here is a wellmade wood window with a foam spacer for someone who despises even a little maintenance on windows i personally would still avoid wood however if i had to do real wood i would use weather shield aluminum clad wood windows with the foam spacer in my house no metal equals less condensation where the glass meets the wood weather shield also makes wood windows with vinyl and fiberglass exteriors but i am not a huge fan of the overall design of those two products their bread and butter is the aluminumclad and i would recommend that window to anyone who wants to stick with real wood so that is my opinion on some of the pros and cons of the big  plus  weather shield i hope you find it helpful if you want more detail or have more questions on any exterior product i am available by

marvin integrity and possibly the company gjhseptember   i just bought a house full of marvin integrity fiberglass windows and they are horrible the doors barely roll and the sliders bind and drag through the entire travel the sales rep tried one window that my wife can barely move and he said it was normal and told me that these are a lowend window but certainly not a lowend price marvin is apparently willing shovel manure and call it service avoid these windows and probably the entire company email commentbookmarklike comments  thank you for reporting this comment undo millworkman something does not sound right here no way in hell a marvin salesman would tell you they are a lowend window because they are not and i assume your telling me they are installed properly as this sounds like an installation issue to me   like    bookmark     september   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo amberwindows i agree that this issues sound like they are related to installation you need to contact the local marvin distributor for your area to inspect if you are in the west us thats me   like    bookmark     september   at am thank you for reporting this comment

bookmark     september   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo friedajune i could be wrong but this sort of post or the op sounds like troll to me perhaps written by someone who is selling a marvin competitor and getting whupped by marvin the person posted same day as signing up to the forum gave very little information never came back to respond to the other posters and related a very untypical response by a marvin sales rep i guess just something about the tone sounds askew or wonky to me  like    bookmark     september   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo desertwest i agree akchicago and great to hear a marvin rep is on the ball and looking to make things right they get bonus points for that in my book  like    bookmark     september   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo skydawggy i never take the one post and run posters seriously they are generally either competitors tired of losing sales to marvin or someone with an ax to grind for some hazy reasoning notice how the poster in this case didnt stick around to answer any questions and hasnt responded since the original drive by post  like    bookmark     september   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo desertwest not sure about the integrity of the poster but i have to chime in here because the marvin rep here is doing something sneaky in my opinion i live at  ft and was interested in windows that qualify for the tax credit in order to qualify these marvin windows need argon i noticed on their warranty that it is voided if windows are installed at  ft without breather tubes you cant have argon gas and breather tubes as the argon leaks out immediately i pointed this out and he said so i would still qualify for the tax credit theyd make an exception for my warranty so he wants to sell me argon and no breather tubes but if their warranty notes this issue then there must be a good reason for breather tubes at  ft  like    bookmark     october   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo amberwindows there is a very good reason for the breather tubes and that is so that your units do not combust from the altitude when the new tax rebates were brought about there were areas that were going to be a challenge due to the issue of altitude the peramiters of the tax rebate left a good portion of manufacturers scrambling to ensure that they could compete in markets such as colorado where universally cap tubes have always been a standardmarvin as well as many others have changed some of the guidelines through additional tests so that more consumers in these areas qualify this qualification is based on a number of factors such as the altitude and the type of units you are ordering although  feet is above what i believe may be a qualified project your dealer would be the best option to discuss this with they can submit your project for approval from marvinthere is a specific link to tax rebate information on the marvin website at wwwmarvincom if you are still unsure then please call in we are glad to discuss your options  like    bookmark     october   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo loomis i too would be wary of anyone who

from marvin integrity is crap to me it is low end and the warranty isnt worth the paper its written on we installed them in a small cottage we built and ended up removing them to many issues overall for what you pay there are alot better windows out there for the price  like    bookmark     october   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo pro east bay  lcsanjose  i really dont understand your posts you have bashed integrity and pella among others with nothing positive offered as for the service that integrity offers it is some of the best in the industry and is a bullet proof window as for installing in a small cottage and then pulling them out i would like to see pictures i doubt we will hear from you again  like    bookmark     october   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo amberwindows eastbay  thank you my company does not represent the integrity line in n ca but we do in s ca and several other states we work diligently to represent the homeowner in a fair and timely manner lcsanjose  i am sorry that you had the experience that you did but please understand that there are many factors that can attribute to the product not functioning to the homeowners expectations and that unfortunately are not the fault of the manufacturer not having intimate knowledge of your situation i am not going to assume that this was the case if you would like to post the circumstances i would be happy to discuss it with you  like    bookmark     october   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo friedajune typically when someone signs up for the forum the same day they rant as lcsanjose did in this thread and that rant is not seeking advice or asking a question or indicating any expectation for a response its a troll a fake another tipoff  no information about the complaint when someone is telling a true story they dont just say their windows had issues as lcsanjose did people with true problems provide some details just ignore lcsanjoses post

at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo gjharkingmailcom no i am not a troll i bought the windows and in spite of being told by the installer and the customer rep that the windows are the problem they are not it was an installation problem from day  i managed to get the dealerinstaller out to fix some of them by stopping payment on the check but two were damaged by their install procedures three months later i have just purchased two new windows and had them installed the fight continues over who pays unfortunately marvin integrity has actively worked on behalf of the dealer to get me to pay him without getting my windows fixed  like    bookmark     december   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo skydawggy so you started out blaming marvin the company that made the windows and now you admit the windows are fine its a problem with the independent installer due to a poor installation how is this marvins fault  like    bookmark     december   at am thank you

considering the all ultrex integrity windows for our socal beach house due to some retailers recommendations  like    bookmark     may   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo gjh i didnt realize this might attract others i would say that the integrity windows are decent comparable to the pella fiberglass maybe a bit better definitely better than the anderson composites little noise or air intrusion and the sliding mechanism is acceptable i was told by the marvin representative that the problems were with the windows themselves not the installation in his own words these are a low end window i dont think that is true marvin like pella and anderson are more expensive but im not going to say they are overpriced if i had it to do over again i would buy integrity or pella i spent quite a bit of time and money undoing the disaster created by the dealerinstaller and i got no help from marvin windows so be sure the installer is good and expect nothing from marvin windows once they leave the factory  like    bookmark     december   at am thank you for reporting this comment undo homesealed your newest post sounds quite a bit different from the first one you mention that the dealerinstaller was the cause for this disaster so it would seem unreasonable to expect that the manufacturer would take responsibility for that you wouldnt complain about the farm if you get a bad steak at a restaurant rightin my dealings with marvin their service after the sale is very good and one of the best that ive seen ultimately though your final advice is good be sure to choose a good installer the installerdealer is the entity that you as a consumer are dealing with so this choice is of paramount importance to make sure your project goes smoothly  like    bookmark     december   at pm thank you for reporting this comment undo pro straight a builders inc we install marvin and integrity windows and have had great success and customer satisfaction even the best window money can
