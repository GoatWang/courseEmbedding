investing the form was signed by stephan stein buttonwood alpha q p fund llc is a reg d private placement reg d private placements involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds the white law group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling private placements like buttonwood alpha q p fund llc however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a finra arbitration claim recovery of investment losses to determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a
