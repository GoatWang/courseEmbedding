form d disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors the information in form d is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it this is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing this could help competitors entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer why fundraising reporting is good for sigora international also the form d signed by michael chapman might help sigora international inc’s sector first it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed the odds are higher that it will stay in the business second this could attract other investors such as venturecapital
