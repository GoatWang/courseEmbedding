of the lymphatic and venous systems that result in progressive swelling inflammation and skin changes although there is no cure for lymphedema the symptoms and complications can be controlled with the initial care of a certified clinician and daily treatment at home cvi if not treated or controlled can result in progressive skin changes and difficulttotreat venous leg ulcersabout the lymphatic and venous systemsthe lymphatic and venous systems work together to maintain fluid balance in the body in a normally functioning circulatory system arteries carry oxygenated and nutrientrich blood from the heart to all parts of the body the veins then carry the blood depleted of oxygen and nutrients back to the heart for reoxygenationsome molecules are too large for the veins to take in and are absorbed and transported by the lymphatic system while the lymphatic system has a key role in the body’s immune defense its primary function is to help balance fluid by clearing the remaining excess water large molecules such as plasma proteins and cellular debris from the interstitial space as the body’s drainage and filtering system the lymphatic system transports proteinrich fluid to the lymph nodes for detoxification before returning the fluid to the venous circulationchronic swelling develops when the lymphatic system andor venous system has not developed properly or becomes damaged in cvi when normal blood flow is hindered the increased venous pressure from valvular incompetence or obstruction results in blood and fluid leakage into the surrounding tissue as fluid accumulates swelling hyperpigmentation and fibrosis hardening occur leading to progressive tissue breakdown and venous leg ulceration prolonged or untreated cvi may damage the lymphatics due to increased
