jersey north » new jersey south » pennsylvania   company name city state zip phone email location south nj pa north nj de about us  it was  edward hall company opened its doors for business at  south nd street philadelphia pa in a fourstory  square foot building that specialized in the sales of imported african mahogany lumber the company was located in the historical center of the city just three blocks east of independence hall and carpenters hall south of elfreths alley and the betsy ross house by  the business was prospering and edwards son william f hall second generation joined the firm soon after that the company was then renamed edward hall  son in  at the age of  edward hall passed and william had control known to have an aversion to nicknames which was commonplace for men with the name william he preferred his middle name fessenden following his fathers death he elected to cease using his given name dropping it altogether and was known thereafter as fessenden hall two years later in  fessenden modified the name of our company to match since that time our business has been known as fessenden hall  around  plywood began to receive acceptance as a construction material first developed in europe the product had been hampered by poor quality the result of the lack of glue technology yet plywood appeared to be a commodity with a future by the time world war i started casein glue had been developed and its use in the manufacture of plywood resulted in major improvements in the product the material now had stability and was effectively used for both interior and exterior applications as the war progressed shortages of imported mahogany worsened until no mahogany from any world source could be found in contrast plywood factories were springing up all over the united states manufacturing the product from domestic woods fessenden hall moved with the tide and become a major distributor of the plywood products fessenden halls son edward c hall third generation also had joined the firm our companys plywood sales boomed with the advent of fir plywood manufactured on the west coast the very first railcar load of this new product shipped east was received by fessenden hall acceptance of this fir plywood by the woodworking industry went very well fessenden hall aggressively promoted and marketed the products all over the east and into the deep south in  at the age of  fessenden hall passed and edward had control  in  the formica insulation company approached edward c hall suggesting that fessenden hall become a distributor of its new highpressure product sold under the trade name of formica® the uniqueness quality and durability of formica® products coupled with the sales and distribution experience of our company proved to be an excellent combination  it was around this time that a young service veteran who was selling insurance in philadelphia and new jersey as a prudential insurance agent made a sales call on edward c hall with the intent of selling him a policy conversely edward saw an enthusiastic salesman and suggested that he consider selling plywood for fessenden hall the year was  and the salesman was bob h birdsall sr fourth generation  in  fessenden hall took on a line of philippine mahogany lumber sidings and moldings manufactured by the insular lumber company on the island of negros in the philippines the post war building boom was well underway and fessenden hall significantly expanded its efforts promoting plywood mahogany sidings and formica® products  in  it was apparent that the company had outgrown its south nd street location and needed a larger location the company purchased a fiftyyearold multifloor building formerly a farmers market ice house and german social club which was located at the southeast corner of rd and norris streets philadelphia the squarefoot multilevel warehouse offered so much storage capacity the company was confident it would serve their needs for many years to come  in  bob birdsall sr recognized the need for marine grade plywoods to satisfy the needs of the boating industry initially the market serviced was along the new jersey coast it quickly became international in scope the plywood sold covers a spectrum of applications from productionmanufactured powerboats and sailboats to customdesigned custombuilt luxury yachts where some of the most exotic matched veneers were used  in  fessenden hall moved into a onefloor squarefoot building on sherman avenue in pennsauken new jersey uniquely situated between the tacony palmyra and benjamin franklin bridges which link pennsylvania and new jersey in  at the age of  edward c hall passed and bob sr had control  in  fessenden hall added another dimension to its marketing versatility with the addition of a solid surfacing material produced by ei du pont called corian® once again our company was fortunate to have the opportunity of adding a product which was to receive major acceptance  in  fessenden hall expanded further purchasing a distributorship in laurel delaware known as laurel distributors ltd within a few years the operation was relocated to dover delaware this gave our company additional market penetration in the states of delaware and maryland  in  again expanding our value and versatility for our customers fessenden hall was given the opportunity to participate in the functional hardware arena and the blum hardware line was added  in  bobs son edward birdsall fifth generation joined the firm  in  fessenden hall of pa inc located in lancaster pennsylvania was established to serve the needs of a large number of kitchen cabinet manufacturers fabricators and custom wood shops in southeastern pennsylvania area two years later responding to business growth the company moved the operation to a newly purchased building of  sq ft  in  after  years and much dissection and disappointment it became very apparent that the relationship between formica® and fessenden hall was no longer in the best interest for either party but most importantly our customers the decision was that wilsonart® brand laminate would be the best fit for our customers and our company going forward in  edwards nephew roeby birdsall iii sixth generation joined the firm  in  fessenden hall established a location to service the needs in northern new jersey market fessenden hall north operated from a rented facility in fairfield nj for five years before moving to its newest facility in west caldwell this branch has grown consistently by offering the full product line to the woodworking and countertop industry in north jersey  in  after  years with ei du pont and corian® over time we developed differences in opinion about the market needs and customers expectations of both of our organizations with that being realized fessenden hall found the meganite® brand surfacing material and began to market and sell to hopefully begin building a brand for the product also in  at the age of  bob birdsall sr passed and edward has control  in  the next product for fessenden hall came with the introduction of cambria quartz surfacing this product brought a new dimension to the countertop industry giving the homeowner an improved alternative to granite presently operating in  locations the company now has in excess of  square feet of warehouse space fessenden hall operates and maintains a fleet of  trucks which logs in excess of  miles per year to service our customers we are blessed and honored to have  of the most dedicated committed and trained staff that are truly focused on customers needs and their success looking ahead to the future fessenden hall inc will continue to follow the business philosophy that has served our customers our venders and our company
