presentation to reflect new information future events or otherwise we will be using a slide presentation for todays call which can be accessed by going to the investor section of our web site and selecting the events and presentations page after prepared remarks we will be opening the call to questionsandanswer period on the call today we have michael anderson ceo mike kanan cfo greg divis our cco at this time it is my pleasure to turn the conference over to mike anderson our chief executive officer mike michael s anderson good morning ladies and gentlemen as always we appreciate your joining us on today’s call i’m very pleased with the financial results for the first quarter we generated  million in revenues a company record and we were both cash flow positive and profitable over the last  years we’ve seen an increase in competition for our two largest products at times a bit earlier than wed have liked however this competition has always been anticipated and our financial performance reflects our ability to execute our business plan although these products are not strategic in the sense that they have no ip surrounding that we were and still are very strategic in our selection of unapproved products for which to file ndas we have built this business around gold standard products and look for other factors that could provide us with a good return for the longer term such as injectable products where the barriers to entry are higher we believe our products can continue generating strong cash flow for a number of years and as a result allow us to selffund our ongoing clinical operations and any potential growth opportunities we may come across since these products are really what drive our financial results today ill begin today’s call by providing a brief overview of market dynamics during the quarter across our sterile injectable products and discuss what we anticipate going forward as many of you know a second competitor to our ephedrine sulfate product akovaz entered the channel around mid quarter with a somewhat more aggressive pricing approach than anticipated or was really required to gain share however we were able to keep the necessary accounts to have a great quarter as we’ve discussed before the ims market data shows the annual market volume to be somewhere in the neighborhood of  million vials per year not captured in that data are approximately  million vials that are sold to the repackaging market as you might conjecture given our ims share which falls in the range from  to  this is a market we’ve prioritized and we estimate our overall share up to  million vial per year market to be over  given that we’re now participating in a  player market it is reasonable to expect increased pricing pressure and some loss of share as such we anticipate revenues for akovaz to trend down in the coming quarters on april  as expected a third competitor received approval for its generic neostigmine which competes with our bloxiverz product and we expect this product to enter the channel soon and this is in line with our previous assumption of a competitor at midyear the overall neuromuscular blockade market is estimated to be about  million vials per year just under  million vials of those almost  million have shifted to sugammadex an alternative molecule promoted by merck we do not however anticipate neostigmine disappearing and with high gross margins this will continue to be a meaningful product for us im confident in our ability to maintain our requisite share of this market as we have over the past several years as for our phenylephrine product vazculep we saw no changes in this market we share the  ml market with one competitor and have approximately  of the  ml market we continue to have  of the  and  ml markets we generated  million in revenues in q and expect to continue steady state in this market barring the entrant of a third player the unapproved to approved piece of our business is one that we will continue working on and as announced were planning to complete work on a fourth by the end of this year and file shortly thereafter we believe this product has revenue potential of between  million and  million per year and since it will be both irish revenue and not subject to the  related party royalty it should add nicely to both our top and our bottom lines as previously mentioned we continue to evaluate other unapproved products to develop now moving on to our reston phase iii trial of once nightly micropump sodium oxybate during the first quarter we initiated patient screening and enrollment at sites in the us we expect a large portion of our patients to come from the us sites we are still relatively early in the trial but based upon what were seeing thus far our internal projections for enrollment have not changed beyond what ive discussed we will wait until sometime in the early in the second half of the year to give a more meaningful update on the progress of our study ill now address the rest of our commercial products and business development efforts before handing the call over to mike kanan to discuss our finances at this point in time we think we’ve moved through many of the issues that were inhibiting our pediatric product sales weve made improvements to the sales force distribution and stocking and we’re happy to report that trx trends for our largest product in this bag karbinal er a liquid antihistamine continued to trend upward and have increased  on a quarteroverquarter basis and  yearoveryear we continue to grow this product despite its seasonal nature which tends to see its strongest sales in the spring and the fall we recently launched flexichamber our portable spacer device for use with mdis for the treatment of asthma early observations indicate that pediatricians see the benefits of a portable product and intend to use it as an alternative to products that cannot be transported easily as you saw in our financial statements released this morning were now sitting with almost  million in cash and marketable securities i want to ensure investors that we are actively looking to put this cash to use through the acquisition of products that would be immediately accretive andor a company that was both accretive and a good strategic fit we have a large number of ongoing discussions some of which we think could be great opportunities for our company our business development efforts are an important priority for greg divis our chief commercial officer who just joined us in january greg brings an incredible amount of experience managerial and business development and has already made meaningful contributions to the kick start of our pediatric business and product line we recognize that we need to continue both to add diversified revenue streams to the company and to provide our sales reps with more products to leverage i also want to address some questions that have been raised about our announcement several weeks ago that we’ve initiated steps to reduce our staff in lyon by  positions having previously disclosed our intention to divest medusa and trigger lock two of our technology platforms we obviously don’t have the project load that once we had in our french rd operations in order to more closely align our rd needs with an appropriate number of scientists this decision has been made we have also made the decision to relocate some functions to be closer to the stakeholders which contributes to that number this decision shouldn’t be construed as a movement away from our rd roots rather it should be viewed as a move designed to align our rd with our current business strategy while ensuring greater efficiency decisions like this are very difficult to make especially to those who are immediately affected however these actions will make the company stronger and more focused moving forward our rd organization in lyon continues to be an important part of our future i will now turn the call over to mike to discuss our financial results michael f kanan thank you mike and good morning to everyone on the call and thank you for joining us today as you may have seen in this mornings release we began the year with strong financial results and significant cash flow generation revenues from our hospital sterile products was a record for the quarter and was led by the strong performance of akovaz for the  first quarter revenue was  million for the year we are narrowing our fullyear guidance to be in the range of  million to  million as a result of a second competitor for akovaz entering the market a bit earlier than anticipated and the shift in market conditions for neostigmine for the quarter diluted adjusted eps was  well ahead of street estimates on the higher revenues i just spoke of lower spending specifically around rd and a lower tax rate we continue however to expect rd to be in the range of  million to  million in  and we expect our fullyear adjusted tax rate now to fall in the  to the range of  to  down from  to  in our previous guidance as a result we are increasing our fullyear adjusted eps guidance to a range of  to  which is up from our previous  to  per diluted share cash flow generation in the first quarter was also strong as it continues to be a primary financial focus for our management team in the first quarter we generated  million in operating cash flow our cash and marketable securities at march   was  million up from  million at december  we continue to have ample liquidity to execute our strategy including the completion of the reston trial and invest in selective other growth initiatives as you know in late march our board approved a modest share buyback program we did not buyback any shares in the first quarter as we needed to finish certain regulatory requirements with the irish authorities namely we needed to file our initial statutory financial statements with those authorities we will begin buying back shares depending on market condition shortly but hopefully before the end of the second quarter now lets move on to how we performed in the first quarter revenues in q were  million up  million from q  on strong akovaz revenues this was partially offset by lower bloxiverz revenues due to changing market condition when compared with the first quarter a yearago revenue was up organically  as akovaz had yet to be launched i have more to say on product specific revenue performance in a minute gross margin was  in q essentially flat with q but up from  in q of last year on a better product mix from akovaz and certain onetime items in q of last year that did not repeat this year research and development expenses during the first quarter totaled  million compared to  million in q this decrease was the result of certain startup costs associated with the reston trial we incurred in the fourth quarter that did not repeat in q and the timing of spending in q  compared with the prior year rd was up  or  million due to higher costs related to feasibility studies and clinical programs i expect rd to be between  million to  million per quarter for the balance of  sga was  million in the first quarter compared to  million in q and  million in q of last year the increase in sga compared to q last year was due to several factors including the addition of fscs sales and marketing costs continued investment in infrastructure and personnel and higher stockbased compensation expenses i expect sga to range between  million to  million per quarter for the balance of  contingent consideration expense was  million in q this nongaap expense is the cash payments on accruals we make for our contingent consideration liabilities as many of you know as part of the éclat acquisition we pay  of our gross profit on bloxiverz vazculep and akovaz indefinitely to certain related parties this amount will obviously vary from quartertoquarter depending on the sale and gross margin levels of those three products now continuing down the pl other expense changes in fair value of related party consideration was  million in q this nongaap expense also relates to cash payments and accruals for royalties on the net sales of bloxiverz vazculep and akovaz to certain related parties this amount will also vary from quartertoquarter depending on the sales levels of those three products on a nongaap basis diluted eps was  per share for q our nongaap effective tax rate for the quarter was  this is the lowest nongaap tax rate we’ve had in a while driven from the strong akovaz revenues as you recall a large portion of our akovaz revenues are recorded in ireland where the product was principally developed the rest of our revenue is in the us where its taxed at the us corporate tax rate of  most of our expenses however are incurred in france and ireland where we’ve no history of income and therefore cannot record for accounting purposes any tax benefits in addition as you’ve heard me say before our contingent liability payments are also not tax deductible as they’re part of the acquisition cost of the public lot since most of the akovaz profits are in ireland we expect our tax rate to decline in  when compared to  and should continue to trend towards a more normalized level as we continue to launch or acquire more products from ireland lets move on to the next slide which covers our gaap results please refer to the appendix to todays slide presentation for a reconciliation of our nongaap results to our gaap results the primary difference between our nongaap and gaap results relates to how we treat the acquisitionrelated earnout in contingent liabilities and restructuring costs for our nongaap numbers we substitute the cash payments and accruals for the amounts we record for gaap purposes for gaap however we use a fair value approach as required by the accounting rules in the first quarter we recognized a gain of  million that lowered the fair value of acquisitionrelated liabilities for éclat primarily because of changes in the pricing environment for akovaz and changing market conditions for bloxiverz and the lower fair value of warrants held by a related party keep in mind these gains are reflected on a gaap basis only and are not reflective of the cash payments we make on a quarterly basis in addition we owe contingent royalties on total revenues of our first three hospital products to certain related parties we also adjusted the fair value of these liabilities and recorded a noncash gain on a gaap basis of  for the quarter this trueup is included in other expense changes in fair value of related party payable additionally in our gaap results for q were  million in restructuring costs as mike previously discussed this charge is a portion of the costs associated with our planned reduction in force in france we expect total cost could be as high as  million and expect annual pretax savings once fully implemented of  million to  million our gaap net income for the first quarter was  million or  per diluted share compared to a gaap net loss of  million and  per diluted share in the same period last year the increase in net income is largely due to the gross margin on  million in higher revenues and the gains we recorded in q associated with our contingent consideration liabilities moving on to sales by product sales of bloxiverz were  million in q compared to  million in q  this decline was a result of lower volumes due to sugammadex which was introduced in the second quarter of  now accounts for approximately  of the neuromuscular block reversal agent market we are pleased however that our share of neostigmine market remained at approximately  as we exited q which was slightly up compared to q when compared to the same period last year bloxiverz revenues declined  million primarily due to the entrance of another competitor in late december  and the overall market declined due to sugammadex sales of vazculep were  million in q down slightly from  million in q pricing and volumes remained stable in q akovaz sales were strong  million in q compared to  million in q akovazs market share in the total market which includes the gpo market and repackager market has continued to grow despite new competition and as you heard mike say its now estimated to be greater than  in q our pediatric sales which are included in the line item called other totaled  million we continue to invest a good deal of time and effort in putting the right people in the right places expect the underlying performance of this segment to continue to improve as an example we were able to grow karbinal er trxs by  compared to last year while the total market was slightly down yearoveryear furthermore we officially launched flexichamber with sales force promotions to physicians the last week of april moving on to our cash flow summary our operating cash flow for the quarter was a strong  million and as a result we ended the quarter with  million in cash and marketable securities up from  million at december  and up from  million a yearago our liquidity continues to be strong and we continue to be cash flow positive and expect that will continue in  in closing let me just summarize how we ended the quarter from a financial standpoint as you heard us say our quarterly revenues of  million were the highest in company history and maybe more importantly we were able to convert these strong sales levels to a strong adjusted eps of  we had strong cash flow which increased our cash and marketable securities to  million up from  million just  months ago we recognize one quarter does not make a year and we still have more work to do we are optimistic about the balance of  and expect revenues to be in the range of  million to  million and eps in the range of  to  which is up from our previous guidance of  to  and im pleased that our tax rate is moving in the right direction although we’ve more work to do there as well i now expect our adjusted nongaap effective tax rate to fall in the range of  to  which is down from  to  in our previous guidance and finally we expect to be cash flow positive for the balance of the year with that i will now turn the call back over to mike before taking some questions mike michael s anderson thank you mike as we move into the remainder of our year at avadel we’ve several promising catalysts to provide support for our growing business we’ve a robust unapproved to approved drug product business that continues to provide excellent cash flow and even though its always been a competitive business we’ve continued to grow and maintain our market shares while some may have written these products off as having a short lifespan it should be quite clear that the tails continue to provide meaningful revenue number two we have a promising pipeline of future product opportunities currently in the feasibility stage and an extraordinary product opportunity in a phase iii clinical trial sodium oxybate additionally we’ve a commercial infrastructure that is now growing and a war chest of almost  million to fund potential acquisition or licensing opportunities in summary we believe that both our nearterm and future outlook are quite positive with that operator we will be happy to take questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of matt kaplan with ladenburg thalmann we do ask that you ask one question and one followup at this time your line is open matt kaplan hey guys congrats on the very strong results in the quarter michael s anderson thanks matt matt kaplan can you give us some more color in terms of the progress youre making with the reston phase iii study michael s anderson yes sure we will be glad to matt as you know we dosed our first patient at the end of last year we began our clinical trial in our european sites to refresh those who may not remember were conducting a phase iii  the reston clinical study is a phase iii placebocontrolled efficacy trial thats being run through  patients in  to  clinical sites in europe canada and the us we began that study in europe those sites were up first the sites in the united states where actually we expect the majority of our patients have  were just begun about  months or so ago and so were  we still have some sites to open or to initiate here in the us and were in the process of doing that as we speak we have seen in the last several weeks a marked increase in prescreening and participation in the trial and  but its still somewhat early here in the united states and well try to give you a more effective update sometime after the end of the second quarter i think we will be able  be in a position to be able to update that more effectively as the trial is going today we  thereve been very few hiccups and  but its a yearlong trial and its  it has to continue on we have to enroll a lot of patients some  all of whom have to be naïve to sodium oxybate and its as you know an orphan disease so at the end of the day we dont underestimate that and weve reflected our objective of getting the enrollment completed at yearend based upon those conditions and the number of patients who would participate so i dont know if thats what you were looking for matt i think thats kind of the best we can offer today matt kaplan thats helpful thank you and if i may another question in terms of your internal programs you mentioned kind of continuing to grow your pipeline both organically and potentially through acquisition can you give us an update in terms of the programs you have internally ongoing and feasibility and when those could potentially bear fruit michael s anderson yes we have now five programs underway internally and i’m talking about programs that relate to  that have ip or drug delivery capabilities added to them those are ongoing in our rd facilities in lyon we are currently engaged in feasibility studies on all of those and once we are very very certain that those products are technically able to be done with either micropump or liquitime we will begin talking individually about what those products are in the interim as you may know from our web site we have described some of those products with respect to the therapeutic category so what we dont want to do is get into a position of describing a product and then finding out down the road that technically theres some challenge that we didnt anticipate and wed like to mitigate that chance as best we could i would point out to you the reason for this is because creating extendedrelease liquids is a challenging technology the objective of making a liquid long acting that has good stability is sometimes contradictory and were obviously obligated to have both of those attributes and thats one of the reasons that these kinds of products take a little longer as you know there are very few people who are actually doing this today i think two companies maybe and so its a unique challenge but we think weve made vast improvements to our technologies over the last couple of years matt kaplan great thanks for the added detail mike michael s anderson yes operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from the line of john boris with suntrust your line is open john boris thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results this morning michael s anderson thanks john john boris just back to the reston trial mike the  to  clinical centers i think most of them are supposed to have irb approval can you just maybe give us some insight on the centers in the us how many do you have and how many are actively enrolling versus those that still might need irb approval and then i just have  followup michael s anderson yes sure we have a few john that still require irb approval and were working through that process as we speak you see that particularly in academic institutions as you know those sites weve made pretty good progress were opening sites not every week but pretty much close to every week for the sites that are ongoing in the united states so we feel pretty comfortable about our progress but we are particularly buoyed by the number of patients were seeing from these sites when we originally began this study we were given numbers from various clinical sites and investigators that were significantly higher in terms of patients they can provide than we thought weve kind of paired a lot of those back and they’ve been reflected in our expectations so we still have some sites in the us that require irb approval but most of the sites that are up obviously all sites that are up are at this point in time do have irb approval so we are moving through that we should have that completed in short order john boris that’s great and then the followup just has to do with the competitive environment on indiscernible and i think endo indicated this morning that theyve recently been approved adding another inhibitor in there just did that play a role in the adjustment of the revenue guidance and then any thoughts on bydureons market share within that market michael s anderson that’s a great question first of all yes endo weve  we obviously had anticipated endo they had listed back when they acquired par that there has been workinprocess on neostigmine so it was pretty apparent to us that that product would be coming into the marketplace we modeled it at midyear by the time they get it into the market it will probably we guess be midyear since we are close to that now and so we  obviously it will have some impact id point out to you that ever since we’ve been in this business we’ve had competition we’ve had competition come that would surprise other people we’ve not ever really been surprised sometimes by timing we’ve been surprised but at the end of the day the job in this business unapproved to approved drugs is to maintain your market share and gross margin in spite of competition and  but that’s what our challenge and that’s what we will expect to do with the presence of the endo product in the marketplace i think the neostigmine marketplace has been more heavily impacted by far over the success that merck has enjoyed with sugammadex and if there is anything that has surprised us that has been part of it in europe the share of sugammadex that’s been available for a number of years and where price controls are different has  it was very modest i think in the neighborhood of  we see them already through the end of q at somewhere over   around  of the market which is quite candidly far greater than we thought they are different molecules so what they’ve done is they’ve taken about  million vials of that  million vial market away and the likelihood is is that that for the foreseeable future will stay with sugammadex so what happened is is that when we began this journey we had a  million vial market now we got a  million vial market what we have done is  all through the numbers of different competitors that come into the market we’ve been able to hold on to our share which is stiff around  and we are pleased with that it shows that we can operate this business and in some cases against far larger companies michael f kanan just a comment john on our guidance as you may remember last quarter we said when we talked about our guidance of  million to  million we said that the top end of the range would have assumed no competition in either  additional competition in either ephedrine or neostigmine that obviously is not playing out that way so we are now narrowing our guidance a bit as a result of these two new competitors so that’s the primary reason for narrowing the range there john boris thanks i appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of scott henry with roth capital your line is open scott henry thank you and i guess just to continue on  very quickly on the neostigmine market mike what’s your sense of the sugammadex trend  certainly more than id have expected almost by magnitude but do you sense that  is that closing in on a peak or do you think we are going to  how high could that trend get and then as well how do you anticipate pricing when the next entrant from endo comes into the market michael f kanan great questions scott so first of all i don’t have a crystal ball i think we’ve seen some  beginning of some moderation in their script growth over the last couple of weeks whether that is a permanent thing or an idiosyncrasy attached to those  weeks its hard to tell candidly neostigmine has been the gold standard for what   over  years sugammadex offers a more rapid reversal and it offers more effective reversal of neuromuscular block in people who have had deep neuromuscular blocks and so i think there is clearly a role for it they’ve done quite well with it their pricing has as you probably know been closer to the price of a generic neostigmine than it has a branded product that we would typically expect to see today and to some degree we think that may have had some role in this i don’t know whether it will continue or whether it wont if it got over  i would be shocked but i think that there is probably a little room left for them and we are watching it closely there will still always be a very big neostigmine business and it will always be important to us as it relates to the second part of your question endo entering in the marketplace as you know they were  they’re the company who also got approval for ephedrine we would hope that with three players already in that business and the declining marketplace as a result of sugammadex that the pricing that they would employ would be reasonable injectable products are difficult to make today gmp standards are higher and its more costly to maintain facilities appropriately and i think to a large degree that’s why we’ve over time seen more erosion in these markets than we have and i would hope that that would continue to be the case we will do what we’ve to do to protect our gross margin and to maintain our fair share of the marketplace but we will see we expected them they will be here when they get here well we will handle the accounts that are important to us and do it as best we can scott henry okay great and one followup question just with regards to akovaz i generally had thought about that as a  million market given the more aggressive pricing environment how should we think about that market size under current pricing thank you michael s anderson good question well i think its no longer a  million market obviously how it ends up i’m not sure scott that we’ve seen all of the share adjustments that will have to be made yet and those been in the business they’ve taken the price down akorn has gotten an approval since we’ve gotten ours so you have a three player market two people with a vial one with an amp and i think there is still some shifting ongoing so i think its probably a little early to speculate as to what the final size of that market will be but its a big market there are a lot of vials and we are going to do our best to end up again with our share scott henry okay great thank you for taking the questions michael s anderson thank you operator our next question is from the line of jason butler with jmp securities your line is open jason butler hi thanks for taking the question just one on vazculep you said there were no changes in the market dynamics in the last quarter can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on the market dynamics and in your mind is there a reason why there arent other people pursuing the opportunity or are you aware of other people that you think may come to the market if not this year then next michael s anderson so jason we are not aware of anybody who has filed we would normally be aware and so our  and i’d could only guess that the reason that there hasn’t been all that many or there hasnt been other people coming to the market is its relatively small market and sometimes if companies have lots of product opportunities that are more valuable to them these kinds of opportunities like phenylephrine would be second fiddle so we’ve always modeled additional competition coming in and that’s as mike described earlier always been reflected in ranges that we’ve given for our guidance on revenue and we did that at the beginning of the year with vazculep and we’ve yet to see anybody we are almost at year  midyear they could come tomorrow or we could close december with the same number of players its just impossible for us to really be able to tell but we always assume somebody is coming i’m assuming its just because of size of the market jason butler okay that’s great and then the followup just on the pediatric business you saw pretty impressive growth there this quarter can you talk about where you think the magnitude of growth can trend for the remainder of the year michael s anderson yes i’m going to let greg answer that he is kind of been the guy who has got this business turned around so he will respond to that gregory j divis hi good morning jason thanks for your question i think you’ve seen over the last number of weeks and in q the result of what has been months of work of realigning and resetting the pediatric organization both from where we put people and the direction we’ve provided them and there has to be a level of execution and that continued on through q with the growth that we’ve seen i think right now as we think about the year we expect to have what wed characterize as modest growth as the year continues as we think about it from a demand generation standpoint as we continue to refine targeting refine sales force deployment and get even more asserted on where we are going and the leverage we are pulling to drive demand so id characterize it as modest growth and we are really focused on karbinal er as our lead product and now the launch of flexichamber jason butler okay that’s great thanks for taking the questions operator our next question is from françois brisebois with laidlaw your line is open françois brisebois hey guys thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter michael s anderson thanks frank françois brisebois so i was just wondering  yes so just wondering for the fsc just what they had hit on to the sales deployment so what do you think it was that got karbinal er to grow that much even though the market was actually lower and should we see flexichamber becoming the main product or should karbinal er keep that spot gregory j divis well as we look at today karbinal er is our lead product we think it has the market and the volume that offers the greatest potential in terms of pure value and revenue contribution to the company flexichamber is a indiscernible but  and its we will call a and b the great news is that they are very synergistic in terms of who we call on you’ve an allergic asthma population that is quite overlapped between pediatrics and pediatric allergists so the synergy there is quite good and its allowed for a more efficient targeting and call planning process that puts our people in the right place what i believe is driving the increase we’ve seen is a combination of a few things one is just the improvements that have been put in place some of the enhancements the deployment the execution the accountability but also we are in a market that is predominantly otc and patients are coming to physicians still for relief and we’ve got the best longacting liquid antihistamine that’s available for those patients who are looking for a prescription so when you put all that together we’ve seen the growth that we’ve seen and we certainly expect to continue to have the modest growth for the remainder of the year françois brisebois okay great and then just for a followup probably for you here mike can you talk about why narcolepsy is still under diagnosed and is that getting better i’m just thinking in terms of enrollment here for hopefully the end of the year for sodium oxybate michael s anderson good question and in our view it is  and in the view of kols and investigators that we talk to very very frequently that there is a great belief that its still under diagnosed a lot of these patients present to primary care physicians they would get flipped all around on different kinds of therapies and ultimately when those don’t work as they are supposed to they end up being referred to a sleep center where they can do the appropriate studies and where they can be appropriately diagnosed listen there today are somewhere in the neighborhood of  diagnosed narcoleptic patients less than half of  far less than half of those are on sodium oxybate therapy could be lots of reasons for that some may have failed some may choose not to want to prescribe a controlled drug i mean there  some feel like you can satisfy the needs and requirements of those patients with only provigil or nuvigil or what have you so there are a lot of reasons but we do feel like and as we’ve talked to our kols in the enrollment area as i mentioned earlier frank the numbers they give us are far larger than the ones that we’ve put into our planning so if they are able to provide even a portion of those above what we’ve considered then we will be in pretty good shape but i think we will have to see its challenging obviously to find patients who are naïve and who have never taken sodium oxybate françois brisebois okay great thank you that helps a lot that’s it for me michael s anderson thank you operator operator instructions our next question is from michael sesser with deutsche bank your line is open michael sesser hi guys how are you doing michael s anderson good mike michael f kanan hi mike michael sesser so i just had a quick question with respect to the share repurchase program because obviously shareholders would like you  to see you do it at the lowest price possible and at this point you announced that last quarter havent done any and now we’re hoping to get it started by the end of the second quarter and my concern is just that should investors want to position themselves in front of that you might not get as favorable a price as you otherwise would have so what kind of price sensitivity do you have and i mean how do you think about just the accretion from the share repurchase program michael f kanan hi mike thanks for the question yes we havent  well we announced the program late in march so we didn’t get anything purchased in the first quarter primarily because we still needed to finish certain irish statutory requirements those requirements are now complete and we’re now here soon free to begin a modest share buyback program i’m not going to talk specifically about our strategy around where we believe the right price point is for buying our shares back but i can safely say that we believe the intrinsic value of avadel is much higher than where our share price is today and we feel like returning some piece of our  million of cash is the right investment for our shareholders so we will be careful about how we buy the shares and we will allocate this  million appropriately to projects that are good returns on capital again our priority for use of cash is to fund our organic growth which includes the reston trial do some sort of meaningful accretive acquisitions of product or companies and then lastly to buy back shares so we will be watching both of those things very carefully as we move into completing and starting this share buyback michael sesser okay thank you michael s anderson yes operator thank you i’m not showing any further questions i will now turn the call back over to mike anderson for closing remarks michael s anderson okay so thank you once again for joining us today we are happy to have provided such a what we feel like is an excellent report on our progress and we look forward to visiting with you and  as we report future quarters and other news
