expiration  cik  the company will receive no proceeds from this selling shareholders sale there are many companies competing in the  billion dollar over the counter otc analgesic product market the major players being the internal analgesic manufacturers including bayer pfizer johnson  johnson prestige brands and sanofi all hold a substantial market share and have been dominating this industry for ages bayer leads the category with three main brands known as aleve bayer aspirin and midol the balance held by these internal analgesic product manufacturers has to do with the mix held by private label companies and others the major strengths of these major labels are obvious compared to zapaway present market position the major players have  a manufacturing cost advantage  sophisticated market knowledge and access  established sales capability  strong rd capacity  and of course brand loyalty an important strength of zapaway is that its topical pain relief is accomplished without any adverse risk of overdose and without consequent risk of side effects this competitive strength is derived from the eversion and the cataclysmic shift previously noted in the market of internal analgesic products this shift is consumer preference along with zapaway effectiveness and its ability to be a both a substitute or supplement to these competitors management is fully mindful that mainstream pharmaceutical companies have a watchful eye on the homeopathic product market and will act accordingly should market share be eroded due to homeopathic remedies becoming an acquisition candidate for any one of the leading competitors is very realistic goal management is committed to quality product development and in favor of partnering and forming strategic alliances which would enhance market capability stimulate growth and sustainability the competition in the topical analgesic pain market is headtohead these competitors consist of  zostrix capicasin  osmoflex menthol  bengay menthol  aspercreme tromaline salicylate  icy hot menthol  tiger balm menthol  sportscreme menthol  mineral ice menthol the basis for the competitive analysis is zapaways most competitive feature  it doesn’t have any aforementioned advantages held by its predecessorsyet  it doesn’t have a widespread brand recognitionyet  it doesn’t have any appreciable market share in the topical analgesic alternative health or homeopathyyet  it does have a unique patented formula of safe effective ingredients that none of the enlisted products have most topical analgesic products contain counterirritants including camphor menthol methyl salicylate eucalyptus wintergreen and the ever so popular capsaicin these ingredients even when blended cause a superficial inflammation on the skin serving to only hide pain by deadening pain receptors in the skin what separates zapaway from these inferior products is our enriched all natural ingredients that stimulate blood flow to the body’s microcapillaries and act synergistically with the bodys tissue this promotes selfhealing of the body by getting to the root of the pain treating it at its source management feels that the effective nature of our product will give it clout amongst our competitors and will evoke consumer awareness although our competitors have been around for quite some time and control the majority share of the market they are vulnerable to new product introductions through negative publicity recalls and individuals continuously seeking alternative options for a product that actually works to heal and restore using the body’s natural functions we feel through consumer awareness and the boosted use of our product will relatively enhance marketability zapaway will be position and marketed as the superior product to brands such as icy hot zostrix tiger balm aspercreme and several others however these venerated brands large advertising budgets and consumer loyalty are formidable competitive advantages but also give a clear unidentified target market for immense opportunity the key indicator is implementing the proper strategy that will position the brand for immediate resonation to the consumer that will help create a new segment in the market that is attractive and popular across the various segments of this industry zapaway will promote itself as high quality value product that will be priced competitively and spread out strategically in a position of readiness for quick purchasing and packaged for convenient on the go usability the analgesic alternative and homeopathic product market all support pricing based on perceived value we will create value in the way the product is advertised marketed used and consumed we will also look to acquire other brands not topical analgesic products but other products that can complement the brand and extend its other lines in order to generate sales growth zapaway will monitor the life cycle of all its competitors closely in order to gain a competitive advantage and erode market share from the competition the best way to compete effectively in this market is to constantly position the product in the direct sight of consumers icy hot a primer leader in the industry does this constantly through various marketing campaigns product versatility celebrity endorsements television ads etc these techniques have really registered with the consumer and has created a bond that has built consistent brand loyalty and stimulated sales growth dramatically we feel that this strategy will underscore the importance of zapaways plans and solidify our market presence outlining the purity effectiveness and benefits passed directly to the consumer zapaway will be a reputable opponent for the leading competition through aggressive marketing and advertising exploits we can successfully bridge the gap between industry segments and crossover into the mainstream market relatively easy this more inclusive formula gives the product wider applicability on the competitive ingredienteffectiveness basis the most critical factor will be creating the resources necessary to promote the product previously denoted prior the topical analgesic category including natural ingredient products will continue to be influenced through clinical studies medical advancements and product innovations the three main sources of new competition are as follows  new formulas andor new innovations of existing ingredients some examples are products that include ammonium compounds these products are designed to provide painrelief without the objectionable training smells burning sensation and stinging from abraded skin that are usually caused by the overuse of menthol methyl salicylate and capsaicin as active ingredients zapaways formula is more hightech and will serve the consumer more favorably  existing companies who are already increasing market share in this space and establishing themselves as major players zapaway plans to position itself and become among the elite  drug chains that stretch across borders may produce their own private label homeopathic product and corral a share of this growing market similar to the already proven analgesic product market this scenario is more likely to happen as the homeopathic companies expand the sales volume in this market which will strip share points away from the market  zapaway can be very competitive with proper execution and the right promotional support company description benaiah holdings group inc is an early stage company we were incorporated

product on july   the company formed a whollyowned subsidiary zapion products inc which entered into a license agreement with an entity owned by a relative of a board member of the company to market
