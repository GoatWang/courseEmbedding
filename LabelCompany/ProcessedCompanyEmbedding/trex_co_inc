jensema growth dividend growth investing reitssummarytrex may be considered a commodity  but it does have a moatthe company has vast growth opportunities with few decks made of woodalternative productsa housing market made up mostly of millennials who value sustainable products will support the market penetration of woodalternative productsthe company reported a solid q and issued positive guidance for q introduction for those reading who are unaware trex nysetrex is a manufacturer of railing and fencing products as well as woodalternative decking the latter perhaps being what it is best known for trex has over  of the market and has been seeing its market share grow each year thanks to a strong name brand as well as focusing on growing its base of distributors and strengthening its relationship with builders and contractors some of you may have trex products or probably know someone who does i know that when my wooden deck reaches the end of its useful life a trex deck is going in its place of course there are bears out there as with any stock claiming that its just a commodity and that there is no real moat i would beg to differ as there certainly is some type of moat offered with trex being recognized as the leading brand when it comes to woodalternative decking and superior operational performance and i will be expanding on those topics in this article additionally the market opportunity for trex has barely been tapped and with market trends that favor the companys products trex deserves more careful consideration from investors strength in brand recognition the trex brand is undoubtedly the most recognizable brand when it comes to woodalternative decking material and with their most recent market studies from  and  showing that the company commands most of the majority of its market space with nearly  of consumers reporting that they have used or will use trex while the remaining is spread across  other competitors additionally visits to the company webpage have grown yoy consistently demonstrating the interest in the companys offerings the next market study is set to be completed this summer which will be a helpful insight to see if this trend continues growing at the same pace source growth opportunity another exciting metric is the amount of decking in north america that is still wood is at  with  billion linear feet potentially up for grabs yet there is an undeniable opportunity for a large amount of growth in the market source adding to the size of the opportunity in  millennials such as myself became the largest population segment in america this is important because according to a survey conducted by nielsen in  we put more importance on environmental stewardship than prior generations  of millennials are willing to pay more for products that are more sustainable and trex is made from recycled wood and polyethylene plastic trexs image of being a green product is wellknown having received an award from home depot nysehd as environmental vendor of the year for  and has been rated as the  greenest decking product by green building magazine cap this off with a housing market that is trending in the right direction and which has millennials as the largest segment of the group at  according to ellie mae nysemktelli trex is poised to further its market share the moat i for one think that trex does have a moat and while it may not be as welldefined as microsofts nasdaqmsft switching costs or facebooks nasdaqfb stickiness  one still exists the first component of the moat is brand recognition trex has the advantage of a brand that is easily recognizable and this is an intangible asset much like people will pay more for a tiffanys nysetif diamond than one from another jeweler even though the diamonds may be same the second component of trexs moat is their cost advantages it was noted in the q conference call that earnings grew much more rapidly than sales and was due largely to lower raw material costs and other costsaving initiatives coupled with a higher utilization and other operational efficiencies this is reflected in the fact that while in fy  sales increased from  to  eps increased from  to  thats a  increase in eps with only a  increase in sales going forward the changes in eps could be much greater with the significant potential for growing sales as demonstrated earlier i am sure someone will be quick to point out eps being influenced by share buybacks sure there were some share buybacks  while the  repurchased in  is almost double that of  its only an increase of  and does not account for the large growth in eps the main driver was reducing the bottom line looking at a snapshot from the companys most recent investor presentation we see that key metrics are moving in the right direction with net sales adjusted gross margins ebitda and diluted eps all trending up in q and on a trailing twelvemonth basis source q selloff  an opportunity to enter at a discount after reporting q results in which revenue increased  and eps was up  the market decided the valuation was too steep or something else as i have not entirely figured out why and sold off with share prices dropping about  over the days after the may th report this is an example of the market being irrational at times leaving some investors scratching their heads while gross margin was up  basis points to  sga expenses were up  million in relation to the companys strategy to continue growing the brand strength via marketing and development initiatives forward guidance provided indicated that trex looks to grow sales approximately  in the second quarter with sga remaining flat compared to the q of last year if the guidance sticks another solid quarter is in store for trex conclusion given the current markets characteristics and the positioning of trex this is a company that can be held for the next  years while listening in on the quarterly calls to ensure the thesis remains intact should trexs brand strength falter or its operational efficiencies erode then my thesis will need to be reexamined with a pe roughly x trex is not terribly overvalued given its growth potential has a forward pe of  while that may not be a bargain i think again given the growth potential this company possesses its not too lofty if youre still on the fence wait for another quarter and see what happens and you could even wait for this years survey results to see if they confirm my thesis but whether you buy or not i would keep an eye on this stocks quarterly
