globe as the best approach for managing their financial assets the endowment investment strategy seeks to increase total portfolio return while maintaining an acceptable level of risk through diversifying into performanceoriented assets other than us stocks and bonds additional asset classes targeted include global equities real estate private equity natural resources absolute return investments hedge funds and managed futures and additional asset classes endowments have a long term investment time horizon with low liquidity needs that can take advantage of all of these different asset classes investors should consider how closely their investment goals and needs match those of endowments endowment strategy portfolios key similarities broad diversification investments are made in numerous investment categories ranging from traditional equities and bonds to alternative investments such as real estate and private equity reduced correlation limited or low correlation between investments is targeted to reduce overall portfolio volatility alternative investments a large percentage of the portfolio is devoted to holdings other than us stocks and bonds illiquid investments investments that cannot be quickly sold are targeted because they can offer performance premiums to compensate for their lack of liquidity real assets investments in real or hard assets such as real estate are sought because they can offer inflation protection and income as well as capital appreciation potential various investment structures different structures and investment vehicles are used

consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund this and other important information is contained within the fund’s prospectus which can be obtained by calling   the fund’s prospectus should be read carefully before investing investing in the fund involves risk including those summarized below an investment in the fund is generally subject to market risk including the loss of the entire principal amount invested an investment in the fund represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund endowments have a long term investment time horizon with low liquidity needs investors should consider how closely their investment goals and needs match those of endowments like all financial instruments the value of these securities may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably the value of your investment in the fund at any point in time may be worth less than the value of your original investment even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions when the fund invests in equity securities the fund’s investments in those securities are subject to price fluctuations based on a number of reasons of issuerspecific and broader economic or international considerations they may also decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries in addition equity securities prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase the fund may invest in publiclytraded and nontraded reits or privately offered pooled investment vehicles that hold real estate as well as invest in real estate directly through entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the fund as a result the fund’s portfolio may be significantly impacted by the performance of the real estate market and may experience more volatility and be exposed to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio reit share prices may decline because of adverse developments affecting the real estate industry and real property values in general real estate values can be affected by a variety of factors including supply and demand for properties the economic health of the country or of different regions and the strength of specific industries that rent properties exposure to the commodities markets may subject the fund to greater volatility than investments in more traditional securities the value of commoditylinked investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as weather and international economic political and regulatory developments the fund may invest in medium and smallcapitalization companies which may be newly formed or have limited product lines distribution channels and financial or managerial resources the risks associated with these investments are generally greater than those associated with investments in the securities of larger moreestablished companies this may cause the fund’s net asset value to be more volatile when compared to investment companies that focus only on largecapitalization companies the fund is classified as a nondiversified management investment company under the investment company act of  as amended this means that the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a limited number of issuers than would be the case if the fund were classified as a diversified management investment company accordingly the fund may be more sensitive to any single economic business political or regulatory occurrence than the value of shares of a diversified investment company the shares have no history of public trading nor is it intended that the shares will be listed on a public exchange at this time we do not expect a secondary market in the shares to develop even if any such market were to develop closedend fund shares trade frequently at a discount from net asset value which creates a risk of loss for investors purchasing shares in the initial public offering you should consider the shares to be an illiquid investment even though the fund will make periodic repurchase offers to repurchase a portion of the shares to provide some liquidity to shareholders only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase by us once each quarter the fund will offer to repurchase at net asset value nav per share no less than  of the outstanding shares of the fund unless such offer is suspended or postponed in accordance with regulatory requirements the fund may increase the size of these offerings up to a maximum of  of the fund’s outstanding shares in the sole discretion of the board but it is not expected that the board will do so you should consider that you may not have immediate access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time an investment in our shares is not suitable for you if you need immediate access to the money you invest wildermuth     daily nav wefcx       daily nav wesfx     get in touch with us contact information we invite you to learn more
