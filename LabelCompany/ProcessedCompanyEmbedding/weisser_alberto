alberto weisser — biography  dutch founder before bunge directing financial change agribusiness home business biographies sz alberto weisser — biography alberto weisser – chairman and chief executive officer bunge nationality brazilian born  education universidade de são paulo ba career basf – various financerelated positions bunge – cfo – ceo – chairman and ceo address bunge  main street sixth floor white plains new york  httpwwwbungecom ■ alberto weisser was appointed chief executive officer of bunge in january  and was elected chairman of the board in may  he had joined bunge in july  as its chief financial officer and had been elected to the board of directors in  during his years with bunge weisser helped to expand the conservative once familyowned agribusiness company through numerous key acquisitions including its largest acquisition of the french agribusiness company cereol in  though the name bunge is scarcely known to the average american its raw foods go into many wellknown and popular brands including products made by general mills fritolay kellogg company and nestlé dutch founder in  johann peter gottlieb bunge a dutch grain trader founded bunge in amsterdam the netherlands as a graintrading business the company grew to become a leading commoditytrading company within the consumernoncyclical sector of the foodprocessing industry the companys headquarters was eventually moved south to rotterdam in  it relocated still further south to antwerp belgium bunge later made a major move to buenos aires argentina and still later to sao paulo brazil in both of which countries it capitalized on the rapidly growing grain trade over the next century descendants of the bunge founder built a thriving international business expanding into north america asia and australia however the talented but oldfashioned family management team could not compete against the worlds emerging multinational corporations also the team could not appease the feuding factions of family shareholders and could not deal with the changing political climate in south america to save the company outside management was recruited—alberto weisser was a part of that influx before bunge weisser earned a bachelors degree in business administration from the university of sao paulo in brazil and participated in several postgraduate programs at the harvard business school in cambridge massachusetts he also attended the management development program at insead in cedex france before his relationship with bunge weisser worked for  years from  to  in various financerelated positions with the german petrochemicals giant basf in brazil germany the united states and mexico in  with the global marketplace expanding after physical and ideological barriers were broken down at the end of the cold war the familyowned bunge changed its general strategies in order to have access to more financial capital and to end the bickering that continued between family members professional management was brought in beginning in  and the company prepared itself to become a publicly traded company in order to gain access to equity markets weisser joined bunge in july  as its chief financial officer directing financial change weisser immediately began to focus bunge on agribusiness and food production while divesting the company of noncore assets to emphasize the trading of soybeans grain and fertilizer weisser directed the sale of all of the companys consumer foodprocessing firms except bunge alimentos in brazil which dealt with soybeans and margarine in  weisser—who had become chairman of the board and chief executive officer—moved the company to white plains new york in order to be closer to new york city the center of international finance and trade in august  weisser listed the now publicly traded bunge on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol bg weisser concentrated on three principles that he felt would best sharpen the companys focus within the agribusiness industry knowing that bunge needed to grow in order to survive and prosper he carefully acquired companies that matched bunges strategic plan he reduced expenses and he emphasized efficiency weisser coordinated ocean shipments more concertedly to allow for intermediate pickup and dropoff spots along any particular route and he implemented the backhauling of cargo to its point of origination in order to save costs weisser also helped to consolidate the company into three main divisions agribusiness food products and fertilizers integration across the company helped bunge to take advantage of the synergies among these divisions the resulting cohesion made bunge an efficient lowcost operator—weissers original intent agribusiness bunges agribusiness division was its largest accounting for about  percent of sales the division comprised three subdivisions grain origination soybean productionoilseed processing and international marketing weisser helped bunge to develop processes in which commodities such as soybeans and other oilseeds grown primarily in north and south america were processed as animal feed food products and vegetable oil in the americas and in europe these operations were about equally divided between north america south america and europe providing a continuous supply of raw and processed oilseeds in all locations bunge global markets—the international sales and marketing subdivision within agribusiness—sold commodities throughout the world including in the largest growth markets the european union china and india it operated  offices in  countries in asia europe and the americas in order to provide worldwide coverage to all of the major oil consumption markets food products the production of shortenings edible oils mayonnaise and baked goods made up the majority of operations within bunges foodproducts division its subdivisions were origination processing and global logistics the foodproducts division used raw materials and processed products from the agribusiness division to reduce overall external procurement and logistics costs weisser developed this ability to the point where almost threequarters of the raw materials used to manufacture these products were sourced from within bunges network with better quality control in place due to the companys ability to track foods through the entire production process weisser concluded that food retailers and foodservice providers would be much more likely to choose bunge over its competitors weisser believed that such an integrated process would also provide a safer and more accessible food supply fertilizer as of  bunge was the only vertically integrated fertilizer producer in south america and was brazils leading manufacturer and seller of fertilizer and phosphatebased animalfeed products weisser expanded the companys ability to extend credit to farmers in the form of fertilizer which was then repaid with crops in order to guarantee supplies strengthen relationships and reduce risks further efficiencies were instituted when the same transport vehicles imported fertilizers to inland elevators and exported grains to ships waiting at coastal ports these strategies and the companys positive relationship with brazilian and argentine farmers helped bunge maintain a unique and dominant position in its south american markets in  brazil was the worlds fastestgrowing fertilizer market increasing at an average rate of  percent during the last half of the s and into the s unforested arable lands were being rapidly cultivated for soybean and corn production since brazil had the worlds largest reserve of such lands these two crops were projected to account for more than  percent of the countrys fertilizer demand between  and  under the direction of weisser bunge was poised to take advantage of these future demands cereol acquisition the july  acquisition of cereol the francebased company also running operations in north america and europe made bunge the worlds leading oilseedprocessing company principally processing soybeans canola rapeseed and sunflower seed cereol was also involved in the integrated manufacturing distribution and sale of food oils meals for animal nutrition and food ingredients such as lecithins and proteins the acquisition orchestrated by weisser increased bunges efficiency as a result of refined logistics and increased volumes the deal also expanded bunges global customers base enabled the company to position itself to maximize its growth rate increased employee opportunities and resulted in a more stable financial profile due to a wider product portfolio weisser realized at the time of purchase that the cereol acquisition would help to partially offset the volatile operating environment in agribusiness solae joint venture in  weisser directed a joint venture between bunge and dupont the solae company would leverage each companys respective strengths in soy protein isolates and concentrates anticipating the future demand for soybeanbased products weisser helped develop a biotechnology alliance in order to develop enhanced soybeans this technologybased partnership was expected to turn into one of the worlds leading developers and marketers of branded soybased specialtyfood ingredients the soybean and oilseed company in  under the direction of weisser bunge produced more bottled salad and cooking oils than any company in the world it was also the leading soybean producer in the americas and was either a regional or international producer in everything from animal feed and fertilizers to pie fillings and cake mixes through its north american subsidiary bunge was a major us food processor the company operated a variety of businesses throughout the world in a number of the most rapidly expanding markets processed onefifth of the worlds soybeans and distributed oilseeds and grains throughout five continents the acquisition of cereol in  made bunge the worlds largest oilseed producer with net sales of  billion in  and about  employees at over four hundred facilities in  countries around the world with the help of weisser the company became the worlds leading bottled vegetable oil seller corn dry miller and canola oil producer north americas top supplier of edible oil and premium shortenings to the foodservice industry and a leading oilseed processor south americas largest wheat miller and vegetable oil producer largest overall exporter of agricultural products and a leading fertilizer producer brazils top manufacturer and seller of flours and mixes europes leading supplier of soybean meal chinas leading supplier of soybean products and indias leading exporter of soybean oil capitalizing on world demand under weissers leadership bunge became well positioned to capitalize on the worlds growing demand for soybeans and other oilseed products in the past only one company—archer daniels midland company adm—had dominated the grainprocessing market bunge joined adm in a strong position within the industry weisser then took a cautious approach in leading bunge into processing expansion around the world the company was already operating in india and southeast asia and was making some inroads into china these three areas contained more than  percent of the worlds population weisser acknowledged that they would increasingly demand more of bunges products however weisser knew that mere expansion for the sake of expansion would not be beneficial so he carefully investigated each country or area to ensure expansion would make sense and provide the company with the correct opportunities in china for instance weisser developed a large team that dealt directly with customers although no processing plants had yet been built there weisser closely assessed the market which consisted of about two thousand crush factories receiving soybeans from the half billion farmers throughout the nation weisser expected that opportunities in the market which had a projected annual value of  billion would soon become apparent as economic and political factors unfolded these opportunities could come through consolidation outright purchasing of existing assets or the building of new facilities in an article with lyle niedens weisser referred to his careful planning of longterm strategies in saying we have two hundred years of history we plan to be in business another two hundred years at least february   outside functions weisser was a member of the board of directors of ferro corporation in cleveland ohio a global producer of performance materials for manufacturers he was also a member of the rabobank north american agribusiness advisory board the advisory board was composed of food and agribusiness leaders from academic and research institutions who provided guidance on industrial and political developments to rabobank a global company based in the netherlands which provided financial services to agribusiness organizations sources for further information bunge web site httpwwwbungecom  caplen brian latin america decline of an argentine dynasty euromoney  january
