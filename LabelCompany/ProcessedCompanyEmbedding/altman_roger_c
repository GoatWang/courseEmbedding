founder evercore partners inc corporate award winner “leadership is a subtle mix of elements” early inspiration when roger altman arrived on campus in  the war in vietnam was at its height shortly thereafter the antiwar organization students for a democratic society seized administration buildings on the campus “when it came to getting a transcript or applying for a student loan the buildings weren’t available” altman said “the university leadership and the provost at the time edward levi who went on to become us attorney general came under tremendous pressure from thenmayor richard j daley to allow the chicago police to come onto the campus and ‘clean it up’” the provost’s composure “extraordinary” judgment and resolve to protect students’ rights to protest resonated with altman it was part of what inspired his commitment to public service and philanthropic pursuits “the benefit of going to graduate school is about  percent in the classroom and about  percent the ecology of the graduate school and what you’ll learn by just being there” lessons learned in leadership altman began his investment banking career at lehman brothers becoming a general partner in  beginning in  he served four years as assistant secretary of the us treasury returning to lehman brothers he later became cohead of overall investment banking a member of the firm’s management committee and its board “i was prepared intellectually for finance but not practically looking back on it i knew nothing about leadership i had to learn it on the job i don’t think there is one formula for leadership” in  altman joined the blackstone group as vice chairman head of the firm’s advisory business and a member of its investment committee with primary responsibility for blackstone’s international business beginning in january  mr altman returned to washington to serve as deputy secretary of the us treasury for two years “leadership in my own experience is a very subtle mix of elements i don’t think you can lead entirely by consensus just taking a vote on any issue on the other hand elements of consensus are very important there’s a fine line between waving a sword and saying we’re going up that hill and having an approach which builds support among your employees and your teammates so that you’re not an autocrat autocrats—at least in what i’ve ever seen—don’t last too long” the power of public service growing up in a “classically progressive” massachusetts family altman embraced the civicminded attitude and it has deeply influenced his commitment to giving back “public service remains my greatest interest” he said altman is a trustee of new yorkpresbyterian hospital serving on its finance committee and is a trustee of mit he also serves as chairman of new visions for public schools “the only way that we’re going to enable living standards in this country to begin climbing again is through better educating our population the pressures of technology and globalization require certain skills that in turn require higher education to achieve if we don’t get our high school graduation rate up and our college completion rates up we’re not going to be able to get living standards in this country moving forward again education is more than ever the doorway to opportunity and there are too many americans who don’t go through that door” the value of entrepreneurship with a unique vision altman launched evercore in  guided by the idea that clients would be better served by advisers who were not tethered to the demands of a multiproduct financial institution today the firm has more than  partners  employees and has handled over  trillion of merger acquisition recapitalization and restructuring transactions “the most meaningful thing i ever did in business was found and build up evercore” altman said his appetite for constant growth coupled with his continued ability to succeed in new directions is proof of his resiliency curious mind and entrepreneurial acumen throughout a long career now stretching into its fifth decade he remains invigorated by his work “i have never had a boring day in this field one is constantly taking on new assignments involving different types of businesses with different types of challenges and even the same client two years later often faces a whole new set of issues” roger c altman  san francisco ca  intelius

got it by ezra klein by ezra klein september   roger altman cofounder of evercore partners win mcnameegetty roger altman a former deputy treasury secretary and a cofounder of the investment firm evercore partners thinks the us economy could be on the verge of an unexpected boom heres why  the housing sector is improving  the first signs of renewal have appeared prices are rising in almost half of the country’s major housing markets pentup demand is huge goldman sachs expects housing starts to hit m annually by  up from  this year after  the total will rise further and boost gdp as household formation rates and the startstopopulation ratio revert to historical norms  the breathtaking increase in oil and gas production data from the us energy information administration support this natural gas output reached an alltime high this year with shale gas accounting for half of it on the oil side us production fell  percent from its  high to only m barrels a day in  driven by shale it is up almost  percent from  to  ihs cera a research group projects that oil production will rise another m bd and reach a new high by  within five years the oil gains alone could add more than  percentage point to annual gdp growth and up to m jobs the fall in natural gas prices will reduce the average utility bill by almost  a year  the us banking system has recovered faster than anyone could have imagined capital and liquidity have been rebuilt to levels unseen in decades legacy mortgage problems are fading profits are very strong lending is growing quickly total bank credit outstanding now stands at tn according to fed data a record high the proportion of bank lending going to business will next year probably reach a record level  the us has made a huge leap in industrial competitiveness unit production costs are down  percent over the past  years while costs have risen in almost every other advanced nation  the us may surprise itself and the world by rectifying its deficit and debt problems if barack obama is reelected he may allow the george w bush tax cuts to expire at the end of  that step could force congress to the negotiating table and produce a large balanced deficitreduction programme that would boost confidence the stock market and private investment more from altman here is he right i have no idea but you dont have to be wildly optimistic about the american economy to expect the next four years to be much stronger than the last four as ive argued previously that makes the outcome of this election unusually important as the winner – and his policy platform and his party – stands to reap the gains of being in office when the economy finally recovers no matter whether he or his policies actually deserve the credit business

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
