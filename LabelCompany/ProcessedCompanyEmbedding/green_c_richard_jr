the company said that market realities demanded a strategic repositioning of the company and its recent decision to substantially reduce the scale and scope of its business that reduction now in turn requires a smaller executive staff robert greens resignation follows that of other top executives from other energy merchant companies including dynegy incs chairman chuck watson and cfo rob doty aes corp ceo dennis bakke cms energy chairman william t mccormick jr and nrgs chairman david h peterson and cfo leonard a bluhm top trading executives at many of the energy merchant companies also have resigned the mutual agreement between robert green and the board of directors included a separation agreement that he negotiated with the boards compensation committee the committee consists of three independent outside directors and was assisted by independent outside compensation consultants and legal counsel which advised the board on the range of competitive market best practices with respect to severance arrangements for ceos robert greens severance package consists of three times his base salary plus a bonus in consideration of his resignation and the termination of his existing employment agreement under which more generous separation benefits would have been payable upon certain events as well as his willingness to enter into fiveyear noncompete and nonsolicitation covenants bob green will receive a separation package consisting primarily of three times his base salary plus average annual incentive value paid over the past three years the company said in a statement also included are customary benefits such as medical coverage and administrative support for the next  months while he continues to provide services to the company bob green will be compensated and will receive continued basic benefits such as insurance and medical coverage the company will also provide an offsite office for bob greens use and administrative support during this period in a statement robert green said my appointment to ceo in january  came as our energy trading and risk management merchant generation and international operations were increasing the size and complexity of our business following our decision to reposition the business both strategically and financially a much smaller executive team is required i strongly support richard greens return to leadership of the company as ceo he has the knowledge and experience to serve our shareholders interests well richard green founded utilicorp united which became aquila inc last year in  from missouri public service co our decision in  to pursue an energy merchant strategy was founded on our strength as one of the countrys leading wholesale energy marketers said richard green we were poised to follow a strategy capable of delivering doubledigit earnings growth for our shareholders the recent collapse of the energy merchant market he said was the result of misguided behavior on the part of a few industry players yet we all suffered from the resulting fallout i respect bob for his courage and the swift action he took in response to the markets nearly overnight loss of confidence in the merchant sector followed by virtual abandonment robert green was elected president of the company in  and as coo he led the integration of its domestic and international growth strategies he played a key role in building aquilas international businesses in  he was named chairman of the companys energy merchant subsidiary which included operations in the united kingdom and parts of europe as the company prepared for an initial public offering of that business he joined aquila in  and was president of its missouri public service division before being named executive vice president of the company and a director in  as weve resized our global workforce to reflect our change in strategic direction it was necessary to reexamine our staffing needs at the executive level said richard green
