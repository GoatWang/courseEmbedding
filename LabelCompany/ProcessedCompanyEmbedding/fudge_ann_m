but an allbutinsurmountable concrete wall that researchers say blocks blacks and other minorities from companies upper echelons for years her success went relatively unnoticed amongst media tallies of other female movers and shakers in high positions—but thats probably not something to which the dynamic and wellregarded executive gives much thought rising to the presidency of the  billion beverages desserts and post division of kraft general foods before she turned  fudge never lost sight of her family duties nor her civic responsibilities she even retired from corporate life in the early s to devote more time to her personal life before being recruited to become the president of the advertising giant young and rubicam brands in  her unique blend of business acumen and respect for her personal life made her a much sought after mentor to businesses and people alikefudge was born on april   in washington dc and attended the citys catholic schools witnessing the urban riots in the

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
