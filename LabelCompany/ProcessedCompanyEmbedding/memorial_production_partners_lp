partnership holders of the two note issues will receive  and management could eventually get up to  of the new stock under an incentive plan according to the disclosure statement docket  distributions to equity holders is rare in bankruptcy but valuing their recovery is complicated by very complex income tax issues reorganization plan memorials master limited partnership business model of using hedging and bank borrowing leverage caused them to implode as energy prices dropped and the semiannual determination base amount were decreased this caused a cash crisis they announced on december  that an agreement was reached for a incourt restructuring and they filed for chapter  bankruptcy on january  under the prepackaged plan there is a very complex exchange of debt held by certain institutions that attempts to avoid transferability and marketability issues associated with the securities act of  and to maximize tax deductions for holders of master limited partnership units holders of the notes will receive a pro rata share of  million cash and  of the new stock subject to future dilution unit holders would receive a pro rata share of  of the new stock plus year warrants to purchase  of the new stock at the claim amount of the unsecured noteholders about  billion it is very unusual for equity to receive an actual distribution under a reorganization plan when a higher priority class does not get full recovery this is an actual distribution and not just some payment for releases bonanza creek energy inc nysebcei shareholders for example are getting paid for releases but technically are not receiving a distribution under the bankruptcy reorganization plan under section  of the bankruptcy code a plan is fair and equitable if the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property since a junior claim equity unit holders is receiving a very modest distribution i wonder if a noteholder files an objection to the plan note in my opinion i think the benefit of a very modest equity distribution to shareholders which increases the liquidity and market interest for the new equity distributed to debt holders is greater than the modest cost current rbl lenders will participate in an exit credit facility that matures march  with a rate of libor they will also receive the proceeds of closing all hedges except  million of hedges will remain management will receive up to  of the stock under a longterm incentive plan it does not seem that there is any immediate payment of equity to management on the emergence date disclosure statement financials managements financial projections were based on december  nymex strip natural gas and oil prices these base prices were then adjusted for the differentials to reflect the estimated prices actually received both natural gas and oil prices however have dropped since december  especially natural gas strip prices for  valuations perella weinberg partners pwp estimated the enterprise value to be  million million which implies multiples of xx using  unhedged ebitda of  million using a multiple of x the enterprise value would be  million since the estimated net debt is  million pwp estimated equity value would be between  million and  million using a x multiple the equity value would be  million not only is there a large variance from high and low for equity valuation but it is a fairly highly leveraged capital structure the two notes issues are trading around  that would imply a total equity valuation prior to potential future dilution of approximately  million there are about  billion in notes trading at  have a market value of  million after deducting the  million cash distribution to noteholders the value for the  equity distribution is about  million which would indicate a  million total equity value  million   million these values are prior to any future dilution from both the management incentive plan and warrants the disclosure statement estimated recovery for note holders to be  which is based on pwps equity estimates of  million million the stated distribution to current equity holders is  million million with almost  million units outstanding that would be  per unit the  distribution of the new equity estimated at  million million works out to be  million million therefore it seems they are valuing the year warrants to purchase  of the stock at only  million estimating the value of the warrants is almost impossible without knowing the future dividend policy if no or very low dividends are paid available money could be used for larger capital expenditures which would increase the stocks valueprice that dividend policy would therefore increase the potential that the warrants would be in the money before they expire looking at the financial projections it seems all cashflow is used for paying down debt interest and capital expenditures there does not seem to be any estimated future dividend payments with an exercise price at over  billion the new equity would have to more than double from pwps highest estimated value to be in the money even using a x multiple on  ebitda for the equity value when it exits bankruptcy the stock price would have to increase about  annually to be at about the exercise price time table  february  hearing to approve adequacy of disclosure statement  within  days after the january  filing hearing to confirm the plan  within  days after the confirmation hearing effective date and exit bankruptcy tax issues warning it is extremely important to note that the following income tax information is merely a discussion of possible tax issues it is not meant to be tax advice because there will be cancellation of debt and memp is taxed as a partnership there will be cancellation of debt income codi allocated to memp unit holders i am assuming it will be allocated to holders of record on the effective day for the plan the new entity will be a corporation and new shareholders will not face this problem in the future management tried to structure the plan so that there will also be a reduction in asset valuation that would enable unit holders to take this deduction these two events are not directly offset they will be reported as two different items  not a net item the amount of the deduction for the lower asset valuation is limited to an individual investors adjusted cost basis for their memp units the codi liability does not have a limit i may write additional tax information in an instablog based on questions and comments from readers posted below conclusion memp notes are not trading at a large discount from estimated fair value to justify their purchase as usual during most bankruptcy proceedings i would expect high volatility for the securities based on filed motions and hearings because of the codi tax issues and that current price seems actually below estimated recovery i recommend selling memp units those with very high adjusted cost basis for memp should consult with a qualified cpa to get detailed information for their own specific case to determine the tax impact when determining whether to hold or sell memp units disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i

mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially after investigating and speaking with several attorneys i was most impressed with lars i have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and i found lars to be extremely intelligent compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation lars was on top of every detail of the process due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment i cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation he truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case if i ever had to file suit again i would not hesitate to contact lars again in a second i cannot recommend him enough he does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time i was most impressed with his attitude responsiveness knowledge and compassion i cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of needjohn c • clientthank god for this guy lars soreide is amazing he recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who
