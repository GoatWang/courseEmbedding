subscription see the current issue archived issues applied energetics announces new ultrashort pulse laser product line applied energetics  leave a comment this usp laser will be marketed by applied energetics ae as the wildcat product line of commercial lasers applied energetics inc has announced the launch of its latest ultrashort pulse usp laser product line usp lasers also known as femtosecond lasers or ultrafast lasers emit extremely rapid pulses of light at very high peak power and are capable of ablating virtually any material with high precision and no heat this usp laser will be marketed by applied energetics ae as the wildcat product line of commercial lasers the company will initially target the micromachining industry and applications the usp laser’s highenergy photons are able to directly break molecular bonds in materials resulting in direct “cold” material removal known as ablation these effects lead to cleaner faster more precise micromachining processes usp lasers unlike conventional lasers can process hardened steels semiconductors ceramics quartz sapphire diamond polymers and other difficulttomachine materials without the thermal damage caused by slower pulsed lasers applied energetics cites several key advantages for its new product line  higher performance than competitors means customers can get their work done faster  product versatility allows customers to adjust pulse length repetition rate harmonics and pulse modulation  ae has years of experience building rugged military lasers for the us army and navy resulting in commercial systems that are able to cope with factory conditions and   made in the usa means faster service  most usp lasers are currently manufactured by european companies joseph hayden president of ae commented ultrashort pulse lasers have unique capabilities enabling applications that simply cannot be done with other industrial lasers the usp laser is an emerging technology which is growing for markets such as microelectronics automotive biotech telecommunications and medical device manufacturing our goal with this product line was to produce a rugged compact reliable and easytouse usp laser
