semiconductor is a buyjul  about magnachip semiconductor mx shareholders unite smallcap macro value momentumshareholdersunitesummarymagnachip semiconductor is already recovering but we see considerable mileage in that stillthe company produced solid q figures despite some temporary headwindsit has longerrun tailwinds from restructuring amoled and analog based power solutionswe think there are numerous reasons why you could do worse than buying shares in magnachip semiconductor mx good quarter despite some headwinds restructuring longerterm tailwinds from oled and analog technology in power management valuation magnachip is an interesting company producing its own chips but also acting as a foundry for third parties after a rough patch as a result of accounting restatements the company is getting its act together and things are looking up the above figure shows that the first quarter of this year was particularly good but thats not all the company expects things to get better good quarter this was a really solid quarter in which eps of  beats by  revenue m increased  yy a small beat by m adjusted ebitda increased to m up  from the first quarter a year ago  million in cash on the balance sheet up more than  million from the prior quarter gross margin of  and adjusted ebitda margin of  in q both at their highest levels in four years since q  its fab utilization rate reached a low s foundry revenue  of total revenue in the first quarter was m up  this was the best quarter for quite a while but there were some tailwinds in the form of a net foreign currency gain of m m for q a year ago this was due to the appreciation of the korean won relative to the us dollar a substantial portion of this is a noncash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany longterm loans to the korean subsidiary this is the main reason gaap earnings  per diluted share were much larger than the nongaap equivalent  per diluted share so it doesnt feature in the latter which is the headline figure however there are also some headwinds accounts receivable was m in q up sequentially from m at the end of q  and as compared with m at the end of the first quarter  here is management explaining during the qcc the increase in accounts receivable was part of a deliberate and strategic financial decision to limit the practice of offering discounts to customers in exchange for early payments the reason the company did cut out these discounts is that its cash position is a lot better now other headwinds are a seasonal slowdown in oled drivers and some unfortunate mismatch in products which well discuss below it will be interesting to see how this variable is developing in subsequent quarters restructuring the company is making most decisions on the basis of increasing margins and profitability closing down lossmaking lines and products and reducing headcount for instance the company sold its sensor business which was carrying a negative operating margin and closed a legacy inch fab last year and sold its building and equipment for m it is also reducing headcount which it expects to finish in q reducing it by over twice the  reduction which was  leading to an annual saving of mm boosting margins the associated costs are mm of which m has already been incurred in q and there will be only mm left of that for q below we see that the fruits of these efforts are materializing albeit slowly gross margin already at multiple level highs is expected to increase further in  management guides it to  for q and in q and q its temporary amoled market funk will recover see below giving it another likely boost revenues are expected to be between m and m in q tailwinds as other sa contributors have pointed out tailwinds arrive from the oled market the company is the second largest amoled supplier in the world and is working with the top two amoled panel manufacturers in the world likely to be lg and samsung otcssnlf which are expected to produce most of the amoled panels in the world in the next two years per qcc amoled panels are advancing rapidly in mobile even the new iphones are rumored to switch to amoled and also in tvs they might even make some inroads into computer screens and laptops although that is less certain apart from the growth prospects one has to realize that amoled carries above company average margins as well it also has increased flexibility as it can source amoled from other foundries from the qcc we secured design wins from smartphone makes in china and increased wafer starts from our external foundry to meet an anticipated increase in amoled demand in the second half of the year however in q and probably also in q these have turned temporarily into headwinds due to seasonality and a timing mismatch with the amoled display driver ics demand for older products tapering off without the newer ones being ready for mass production this produced a substantial decline of  sequentially but the company expects these factors to wane and in q sequential growth will resume when volume production from its recent design wins will start on the basis of two new products the  nanometer flexible amoled display driver ic that allows curved edgetoedge design which has been sampled in q and the  nanometer driver ic that the company is going to sample this month but it has a second tailwind from the qcc overall we are upbeat about the longerterm prospects for our foundry business because we are riding the industry wave and the broad adoption of analog based power solution for a whole range of applications the growing importance of analog technology in power management can be traced to the explosive rise of mobile devices that require low power to extend battery life reduce heat improve product reliability and conserve energy likewise power hungry data centers factories automobiles and large screen tvs are big users of power solutions analog technology eeprom and mixedsignal are core competencies are magnachip as an example our bcd process which combines bipolar cmos and dmos is pure analog an ideal for power applications we may be the only foundry able to combine bcd technology with ee technology in a single process node at  micron and we believe we have one of the smallest ee cell in  micron in the business indeed revenue from bcd and ee technology rose  sequentially in q and a whopping  as compared to q  one thing investors should realize is that being in the analog business really isnt the same as digital in terms of required capex because the analog fabs can continue to produce for decades rather than years valuation at present the company has a market cap of m m in cash and m in longterm debt giving it an ev of m sa contributor anthony thorpe produced a very helpful analysis at the start of the year in which he argued ebitda could reach m this year well q already produced m of that and as we argued above things are likely to improve in the second half so we could quite zoom past that m mark in a meaningful way he also argued that most semiconductor companies sell for xx sales which is a much bigger multiple that magna is currently selling for just  its ps valuation has recovered from the lows but is still half of what it was in  before the accounting restatement evsales have recovered a bit more conclusion the shares can enjoy further impetus when the benefits rather than the severance costs of the headcount reductions and other cost cutting efforts exert themselves and the companys new amoled products gear up for mass production in the second half were unlikely to have seen the highs in these shares disclosure i amwe are long mx i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving

the investor relations tab at wwwmagnachipcom i would now like to turn the call over to yj kim yj yj kim thank you bruce and good afternoon to everyone on our q  conference call the first quarter marked another step forward for magnachip on the path to sustained profitability we achieved our financial objectives in q and made significant progress against our operational goals here are a few highlights revenue of  million was well above the midpoint of our prior guidance and gross margin of  was just  basis points shy of the top end of the range both figures easily outpace year ago levels adjusted ebitda increased  from the first quarter a year ago we ended q with over  million in cash on the balance sheet up more than  million from the prior quarter we implemented and made significant progress in our headcount reduction plan thats expected to have a positive impact on labor expenses in sga beginning in q and improve gross margin in the second half of this year fab utilization inched up into the low  range in q as overall foundry revenue grew approximately  yearoveryear and inch wafer foundry revenue grew more than  as compared to the first quarter a year ago we taped out a nanometer amoled display driver ic as planned and expect to sample in this month we began sampling our nanometer flexible amoled display driver ic in q that enables curved edge to edge screens and expect to go into volume production starting in the second half of the year we secured design wins from smartphone makes in china and increased wafer starts from our external foundry to meet an anticipated increase in amoled demand in the second half of the year that’s the high level view here are the actuals total revenue for the first quarter was  million up  as compared to  million for the first quarter of  and a decline of  compared to  million for the fourth quarter of  the yearoveryear increase was due primarily to an increase of nearly  in foundry revenue the sequential decline in revenue was attributed primarily to low demand for mobile amoled display driver ics the declines stem from seasonal factors and a timing mismatch between the expected drop off in revenue from the existing products and when our nanometer product family and new nanometer flexible products begin to generate revenue total gross profit in the first quarter was  million or  as compared with  million or  for the first quarter of  and  million or  in the fourth quarter of  the gross margin for the full  year was  in our view the q profit metrics demonstrate the success so far of the business strategy we launched two years ago and sets a solid foundation for us to build upon for the rest of this year based upon our current view of the business and the expected outcomes of the headcount reduction plan we continue to anticipate that gross margin and adjusted ebitda will show improvement in  now lets turn to the q performance of our two operating segments beginning with the foundry foundry revenue in the first quarter was  million up  from revenue of  million in the first quarter of  and about flat with  million in the fourth quarter of  considering the typical seasonal factors in q this was a solid revenue performance for our foundry business foundry revenue from new products doubled in q as compared to the first quarter a year ago foundry gross profit margin was  in the first quarter as compared with  in the first quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of  the progress we have made in foundry gross margin over the course of the past year is a proof point that we are moving in the right direction as a general statement though our overarching goal will always be to maximize improvement in our overall company gross margin overall we are upbeat about the longerterm prospects for our foundry business because we are riding the industry wave and the broad adoption of analog based power solution for a whole range of applications the growing importance of analog technology in power management can be traced to the explosive rise of mobile devices that require low power to extend battery life reduce heat improve product reliability and conserve energy likewise power hungry data centers factories automobiles and large screen tvs are big users of power solutions analog technology eeprom and mixedsignal are core competencies are magnachip as an example our bcd process which combines bipolar cmos and dmos is pure analog an ideal for power applications we may be the only foundry able to combine bcd technology with ee technology in a single process node at  micron and we believe we have one of the smallest ee cell in  micron in the business that translates to smaller die lower power consumption and lower manufacturing cost the combination of analog based bcd and ee technology is ideal for producing power management solutions and power ics used in smartphones iot devices and for usbc applications foundry revenue from bcd and ee technology rose  in q as compared to q  and  as compared to the same period a year ago fortunately for us the pace of analog technology is not scalable like digital technology as a result we don’t need to invest huge rd sums in bleeding edge process technologies and our capital spending budget is a fraction of what others spend most importantly our fabs have a life span measured in decades not years like digital fabs those familiar with analog technology will understand that it is highly likely that our two analog and mixed signal fabs in korea will still be producing inch wafers in submicron geometry ten years from now when digital fabs will be confronting the end of physical limits of the moores law now turning to our standard products group revenue in the standard products group was  million in the first quarter down  from the first quarter a year ago and down  from  million in the fourth quarter of  standard products group gross margin was  in the first quarter as compared with  in the first quarter of  and  in the fourth quarter of  we don’t break out gross margin by business line but a key reason for the margin improvement in the standard products group in q stems from the work we have done over the past three years to streamline and improve the margin profile of our power products portfolio with that lets take a look at the power solutions business revenue for power standard products was  million an increase of  from  million in the first quarter a year ago and was down  from  million in q  due to typical seasonality the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to a ramp in production of new power ics super junction products and battery mosfets we also believe we now are one of the leaders in battery mosfet the increase in demand for power ics was driven primarily by the need to power multichannel leds in uhd televisions and the increase in super junction revenue stems from a ramp up in demand from the computing industrial and lcd television markets over the last two years we have taken major steps to improve margins in the power product line in some cases money losing offerings were killed in other cases we shrunk the sales side in a given geometry or migrated products to lower geometries to reduce die size power consumption and lower the cost we have also taken steps to further expand the power portfolio with higher margin products with a more competitive power ic offerings now lets turn to the display business revenue for display standard products was  million down  from  million in the first quarter of  and down  from the fourth quarter of  the declines reflect previously disclosed seasonal factors and a timing mismatch with our amoled display driver ics which was partially offset by higher demand of source drivers for ultra highdefinition tvs our display drivers are now designed into  different models of large screen uhd televisions amoled revenue declined  in q as compared to q  and represented  of total display revenue despite the revenue decline amoled margins exceeded the corporate average in q we believe we are bumping along the bottom with respect to amoled revenue and we continue to sequential revenue growth will resume in q over q as volume production commences from new design wins from there we expect amoled to gain traction in q setting us up nicely for  a few qualitative observations we taped out our new nanometer amoled display driver ic in q and expect to sample it this month as we told you we would do on our last earnings call we are optimistic about the revenue potential for this product beginning in the latter part of second half of  and into  we are excited about our new nanometer flexible amoled display driver that we first spoke about on our last earnings call in q we sampled the market with this amoled driver which maximizes screen real estate and enables curved edge to edge screens and as i mentioned at the beginning of this call we have increased the number of wafer starts for our new amoled product at our external inch foundry to meet production requirements for demand in the second half of the year meanwhile our older  and nanometer amoled products continue to generate volume production although at lower levels than in  to sum up on amoled we are bullish on the underlying trends in the amoled market and we are confident in our ability to capitalize on the opportunities in front of us we have been in the amoled business for ten years have unique ip engineering expertise and a proprietary process design kit as well as access to an external foundry to supply wafers in high volume most important we have big relationships with top two oled panel makers in the world who happen to be in korea who currently produce the great majority of the oled panels in the world in short we are confident about our amoled growth prospect i will come back to wrap up the call and provide q guidance after jonathan gives you more details of our financial performance jonathan jonathan kim thank you yj and welcome to everyone on the call as yj said our primary focus is to improve gross margin overall profitability and to engage in initiatives to fuel revenue growth gross margin of  and adjusted ebitda margin of  in q both were at their highest levels in four years since q  adjusted ebitda of  million was just  million shy of the q figure of  million and was up by  million compared to  million in q  and as yj said earlier we anticipate that gross margin and adjusted ebitda both will show improvements in  our goal to improve gross margin and overall profitability is rooted in a financial discipline that drives all decision making about the business and how we manage our pl and balance sheet a few events in q illustrate our commitment to improve margins and overall profitability in q we launched a previously announced headcount reduction program that is expected to reduce the workforce by over two times the size of a similar action in  that affected  employees during the first quarter the company reduced the workforce by approximately  positions once completed the workforce reduction will have an expected payback period of less than  years with an estimated annual cost savings between  million and  million the company believes it remains on track to complete the plan of workforce reduction within the cash cost range of  million to  million during the first quarter the company recorded early termination of charges of  million and made cash payments totaling approximately  million in connection with the headcount reduction the cash payments were comprised of approximately  million related to the early termination charge and the remainder relates to statutory severance the company expects to complete or substantially complete the plan of workforce reduction by end of the second quarter and expects to record an additional early termination charge of approximately  million to  million in that quarter the cost cutting initiative is expected to have a positive impact on labor expenses in sga beginning in q contribute to gross margin improvement in the second half and have an overall positive effect on adjusted ebitda while still preserving our ability to serve customer needs aside from the headcount reduction we are pulling other operational levers to generate cash focus on our core businesses and improve profitability as an example we closed a money losing legacy inch fab in q a year ago sold the equipment for approximately  million and recognized a gain in q of this year of approximately  million from the sale of the vacant fab building in space of approximately  months we got ph approximately  million in cash from the legacy fab that increased our overall gross margin due to a better product mix and higher inch fab utilization lastly during q we spun out our money losing sensor product business which was part of this we sold the sensor product business because the operating margin was negative product revenue was minimal and the longterm roi wasn’t attractive while we continue to service foundry customers in the sensor business our own sensor standard product business was a cash drain and a management distraction now turning back to the pl and operating expenses for q selling general and administrative expenses were  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue for the same period a year ago the increase of  million was primarily attributable to a  million accrual for a civil penalty representing a final settlement with the secs investigation related to the companys restatement ph several years ago research and development expenses were  million or  of revenue for q compared to  million or  of revenue for q  we recorded a restructuring gain in other of  million in q that resulted from a  million gain on the sale of the building related to the closure of our inch fab and a  million gain on sale of our sensor business as mentioned earlier termination charges of  million were recorded for the early retirement benefits payable to the employees affected under the headcount reduction commenced in q operating income increased by  million in q as compared to q a year ago interest expenses were  million and  million for q  and q  respectively the increase of  million was attributable to the interest expense recorded for the exchangeable notes issues in january  now turning to foreign exchange net foreign currency gain for q was  million compared to net foreign currency gain of  million for q a year ago the net foreign currency gain for q in both  and  was due to the appreciation and the value of the korean won relative to the us dollar during the period a substantial portion of our net foreign currency gain is noncash translation gain or loss associated with the intercompany longterm loans to our korean subsidiary the loans are denominated in us dollars and are affected by changes in the exchange rate between the korean won and the us dollar net income on a gaap basis for the first quarter of  was  million or  per basic share and  per diluted share as compared to net income of  million or  per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of  and net loss of  million or  per basic share in the fourth quarter of  net income in the first quarter of  was attributable primarily to a noncash foreign exchange gain on intercompany loans adjusted net income a nongaap financial measure for the first quarter of  was  million or  per basic and diluted share as compared with an adjusted net loss of  million for the first quarter of  or  per basic share and compared to an adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of  that totaled  million or  per basic share and  per diluted share turning to the balance sheet cash and cash equivalents totaled  million at the end of the first quarter as compared with  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  we completed a  million exchangeable notes offering in q and raised an additional  million after initial purchasers exercise their right to purchase additional principal amount of the notes after paying issuance fees the company used  million of the net proceeds from the offering to buyback its common stock inventory at the end of the first quarter was  million compared with  million in q  and  million at the end of the first quarter  accounts receivable was  million in q as compared with  million at the end of q  and as compared with  million at the end of the first quarter  the increase in accounts receivable was part of a deliberate and strategic financial decision to limit the practice of offering discounts to customers in exchange for early payments the change in practice was made possible by the substantial increase in our cash position capital expenditures in q were  million we expect our capital expenditures to be  million to  million for the full year in summary we have taken a aggressive steps to reduce costs and stirrup the balance sheet in order to support the operational progress we have made to put magnachip on the path to sustained profitability now let me turn the call back to yj for his closing comments and second quarter financial guidance yj yj kim thank you jonathan we weathered a significant amoled slowdown in q due to the previously disclosed seasonal factors and a timing mismatch but still show significant improvement in several key financial metrics now we have set our sights on increasing gross margin and overall profitability in  and we are confident we will get there based upon cost cutting actions and the introduction of new products with attractive margins based on our current view of the business we believe our revenue in q of  million is likely at the bottom of the full year and we continue to believe we can achieve modest revenue growth in  over  challenges remain but our results are among the strongest in years and we continue to see our financial results moving in the right direction we have a well balanced product line up a robust product roadmap and a specialized analog foundry business all of which is tightly aligned with the needs of our global customers and with prevailing industry trends with that lets turn now to our forwardlooking guidance for the second quarter of  magnachip anticipates revenue to be in the range of  million to  million or up sequentially nearly  at the high end of the range as compared with q  and compared to  million in the second quarter of  gross profit is anticipated to be in the range of  to  as compared to  in the first quarter of  and as compared to  in the second quarter of  now i will turn the call back to bruce bruce bruce entin thank you yj so christy this concludes our prepared remarks we would now like to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from the line of rajvindra gill of needham  company your line is open unidentified analyst this is robin martins ph on behalf of raji just one quick housekeeping item did you mention that the headcount reduction program will be completed in the second quarter in the next quarter yj kim that is correct we anticipate the headcount reduction to be completed by end of the second quarter and we are on track to save between  million to  million per year unidentified analyst okay great and then also you are guiding towards  to  in gross margins for the next quarter how do we think about margins going forward in terms of the mix between the foundry business and then also the display and power solutions businesses yj kim so as we mentioned we are focused on the overall profitability of the company and so you may have some puts and takes and ups and downs within the segment but the companys overall focus is to make sure that we are executing on strategy to improve our business as well as our profitability for the company unidentified analyst great and then just one more from me before i step back in the queue in terms of amoled you spoke towards the product mismatch being over in the second half of this year and a ramp in the third quarter and more so in the fourth quarter so you have a breakdown on what percentage of  what you are foreseeing in that business line due to current design wins that are already in place yj kim yes so you are asking a very good question so i think that we already disclosed two new products one was the  nanometer flexible amoled display driver ic that allows curved edge to edge design that we sampled in q and we just taped out the  nanometer this quarter we are going to sample this month on the  nanometer that’s going to prevail with a very nice compelling feature so i have spoken only two there will be others so all these we expect these two definitely will have impact in the second half ramp and there will be other one or two that will go into production so we see that there will be a sequential growth in the q nicely and then the set up nicely to q and then set very nicely getting into  unidentified analyst okay and the  nanometer is that also flexible display or have you not disclosed that yet yj kim since we havent sampled we have not disclosed that and so we probably can do it more of this description in the next call operator thank you our next question is from suji de silva of roth capital your line is open suji de silva congratulations on the progress you are making here in terms of the guidance for q  can you give us a sense of how that looks by segment qualitatively if you can give us specifics there yj kim thanks for the question suji as you know we only provide our guidance for revenue and gross margins for the overall company one quarter out at a time as i discussed earlier there could be some ups and downs within the segments but for the overall year we said that we are going to see improvements and when you look at history we have been executing on our strategy as well as the profitability of the company things have been trending nicely and we certainly think that the company is moving in a good direction suji de silva okay fair enough there and then as the amoled business moves to an external foundry can you talk about what that will do to your internal utilization trend near term and then does the foundry business backfill that or can you tell us how that will play out near term yj kim yes so suji i think as a key point here is that the company now has a dual strategy to grow so we have external foundry where we can continue to grow our amoled revenue and all the new products right now is based on external inch whether its  flexible or the  nanometer so we are going to continue to grow that revenue and then internally as the legacy  nanometer moves up slowly or towards the second half then that gives more room for us to fill the fab with foundry or more power products so forth so it gives a lot of multiple choices whatever that makes sense to increase our overall corporate gross margin and profitability suji de silva okay great and then last question on the amoled business can you talk about the competitive landscape and your position as a merchant supplier here do you think your share will be where it is now do you think it can expand and the features that differentiate you guys from the competition that’s out there thanks yj kim yes so first of all we really havent seen any noncaptive competition in our marketplace so we cant really comment on others but let me put it this way we are working with the top two panel makers in the world and they happen to be in korea and as you know based on the analyst and industry expectation that these two top oled panel makers to provide the overwhelming majority of oled panels for the next two years so we like our position in the market we have been in this business for ten years and also the amoled and asic which means that you have to really work with the actual panel makers because in many cases you need to have the ip integrate into your asic we are the second largest amoled supplier in the world we are probably the biggest merchant supplier other than the captive ic makers so we have many builtin advantages and as we said we have already been sampling the  amoled flexible drivers that allows curved screen edge to edge we just taped out  nanometer we are going to sample that part this month that’s going to have a compelling feature so i think we like our position in the market operator thank you and i am not showing any further questions i would like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks bruce entin thank you christy so this concludes our first quarter earnings conference call please look for details of our future events on our magnachip investor

thursday’s analyst blog  semiconductor stocks that warrant a second lookmuch has been said about semiconductor stocks lately with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued neither position can be completely ruled out but it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potentialand what better way than to start with than the zacks industry rank which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock’s price movement can be attributed to the group subindustry that it’s in in fact zacks studies have shown that the top  of zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom  by a factor of more than  to so today we are going to take a closer look at the semiconductor analog  mixed signal group  which is in the top  of zacksranked industriesthe group has slightly outperformed
