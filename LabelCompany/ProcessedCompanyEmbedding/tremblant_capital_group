conference proceedings federal reserve bank of kansas city the federal reserves balance sheet as a financialstability tool robin greenwood samuel gregory hanson and jeremy c stein we argue that the federal reserve should use its balance sheet to help reduce a key threat to financial stability the tendency for privatesector financial intermediaries to engage in excessive amounts of maturity transformation—ie to finance risky assets using dangerously large volumes of runnable shortterm liabilities specifically we make the case that the fed can complement its regulatory efforts on the financialstability front by maintaining a relatively large balance sheet even when policy rates have moved well away from the zero lower bound zlb in so doing it can help ensure that there is an ample supply of governmentprovided safe shortterm claims—eg interestbearing reserves and reverse repurchase agreements rrp by expanding the overall supply of safe shortterm claims the fed can weaken the marketbased incentives for private sector intermediaries to issue too many of their own shortterm liabilities and crucially we argue that the fed can crowd out privatesector maturity transformation in this way without compromising the ability of conventional monetary policy to focus on its traditional dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices keywords central banking policy
