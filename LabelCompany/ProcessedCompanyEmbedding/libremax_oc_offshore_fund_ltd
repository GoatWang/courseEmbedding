doubledigit gains december 6    stephen taub read more greg lippmann libremax capital the former deutsche bank trader and subprime star runs one of a handful of hedge fund startups in recent years to gain traction        libremax capitals greg lippmann photo bloomberg greg lippmann’s libremax capital is turning out to be one of the more successful recent hedge fund startups having reached  billion in assets in just two years since its launch that’s no easy feat in an environment where startups still struggle to raise money it helps that the new york citybased hedge fund firm cofounded by chief investment officer lippmann and president fred brettschneider have produced strong performance the creditfocused firm’s two main funds libremax partners lp and libremax offshore partners ltd were up more than 6 percent through the third quarter of this year including an  percent gain in the third quarter alone and since their october   inception the funds are up more than  percent lippman’s reputation as a subprime star undoubtedly helped as well however lippmann and his team at deutsche bank are credited with creating the credit default swaps that enabled investors to bet against subprime mortgages in  making nearly  billion for the german bank he was reportedly upset with his 5 million bonus at the time libremax told clients in its thirdquarter letter dated november  that it benefited in the third quarter as pricing for securitized products gained strength and synthetic residential mortgagebacked securities outperformed most markets the firm pointed out that the broader markets have been rallying since june after the onset of the socalled outright monetary transactions program by the european central bank — europe’s desperate plan to save the euro by buying sovereign debt — and the third round of quantitative easing by the us federal reserve bank as it looked out to the end of the year libremax said it increased its exposure throughout the third quarter amid a broader market rally however it stressed in the letter that it positioned the portfolio conservatively because of several concerns including the us presidential election the fiscal cliff fears of a renewal of tension in the eurozone and the uncertain effects of superstorm sandy we remain bullish on the relative prospects for securitized products lippmann wrote in the letter after multiple years of underperformance we believe the outperformance of housing compared to other economic data in  heralds the beginning of a multiyear relative trend regardless of the strength of the us economy he also said in the letter he sees potential strength in residential mbs as well as shorterduration nonmortgage backed bonds libremax is not alone in a bloomberg tv interview on tuesday bruce richards cofounder of marathon asset management singled out structured credit illiquid high yield assets such as aircraft lease obligations and the subprime market as especially attractive for investment these days lippmann and brettschneider have spent most of their careers working at the same firms prior to launching libremax they each spent  years at deutsche bank before that both men started their careers at credit suisse lippmann has spent his entire  year career on wall street trading assetbacked securities — mostly mortgages both commercial and residential at deutsche bank lippman was most recently head of all nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities assetbacked securities and collateralized debt obligation trading globally before that he spent nine years at credit suisse brettschneider was head of global markets for the americas at deutsche bank where he was responsible for managing the debt and equity businesses in the americas and supervising a staff of over  people he joined deutsche bank in  as the head of abs trading and syndicate prior to deutsche bank brettschneider was global head of abs trading and the cohead of mbs trading at credit suisse related
