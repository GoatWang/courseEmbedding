manufacturing am technologies as a process innovation may contribute to a job creation further the various mechanisms in which am may contribute to an increase in job creation as well as the types of jobs are analysed the analysis also goes beyond am technologies and incorporates other nontechnological factors which foster job creation ie higher wages in bric countries lower quality in bric countries and a rising demand for westernmade products the analysis is based on a case study and the data collected was through interviews with three prominent actors within the am technologies field in sweden technology developers leading suppliers and users the main findings indicate that am i contributes to job creation in both the manufacturing sector and in the service sector ii does not bring back mass production jobs from emerging economies such as bric iii contributes to job creation in product development stages eg rapid prototyping and iv contributes to job creation in production stages of lowvolume batches mainly of complex products the findings also suggest there are barriers for full exploitation of am in several areas including education systemsauthors tobias c larsson phd

raise interesting opportunities for the manufacturing firm as the function is provided to meet customer needs rather than the physical hardware itself pss offerings based on the manufacturers knowledge about the product and the technology can increase its status as problemsolver and solutionprovider reduce life cycle cost and produce high revenue however pss including eg hardware services software and electronics are efficient and competitive only if developed for the specific purpose with features such as easy to maintain upgradeable with builtin sensors for collecting inuse and service data and easy to use this changes the requirements on the manufacturing firms development process looking back historically the last century gives an interesting changing landscape of the rationale for the productdevelopment methods used in manufacturing firms this article based on the previous research in the product and servicedevelopment fields and on empirical results from studies at several manufacturing firms looks into how the engineering work is affected by pss and how it can be enhanced for pss especially in terms of required competencies and other capabilities it results
