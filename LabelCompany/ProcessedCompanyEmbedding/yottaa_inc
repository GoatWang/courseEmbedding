experience index request your cexi the customer experience index cexi helps online businesses benchmark web performance and user experience the cexi is a compound index that quantifies the desktop and mobile user experience of a web application far more accurately than any single metric the cexi combines objective measurable aspects of performance such as page load speed from both mobile and desktop simulations with specific weighting calculations to provide online businesses with an overall performance score that simulates the actual feeling positive or negative of using their web applications for a modern crossdevice user the customer experience index focuses on three aspects of web performance speed parity of experience across devices and how well a site is optimized in relation to its complexity speed – for the cexi key performance metrics such as time to start render ttsr and time to display ttd are collected and blended and then weighted  for both mobile and desktop users the mobile user simulation uses a g connection and an iphone  with safari browser while the desktop user simulation uses a standard broadband connection and the latest version of chrome then yottaa takes the two resulting figures and weights them  –  percent mobile  percent desktop to match the current trends in web device usage in the us device parity – the cexi compares the complexity of a desktop site for an online business versus its corresponding mobile site ideally a site should be built on mobilefirst principles leading to a design that is equivalent for all users in functionality and also performs well for all users performance power – while an ecommerce site should not be penalized for choosing to create a simple site there are some sites that go above and beyond the call of duty by providing a superrich experience that is also remarkably fast to reward these companies yottaa developed a “bonus” score that bumps up the existing score by  depending on how much power it packs from an optimization perspective this is done by comparing the page weight and time to start render for mobile the more difficult of the two platforms to optimize conversely yottaa gives an equivalent penalty to those sites that should be fast because they’re relatively lightweight but are not to get your organizations cexi calculated and see where you stand in comparison

fastest loading ecommerce sites click the button to schedule your free performance assessment at irce schedule free assessment about yottaa our mission  vision yottaa was founded in  by veteran technologists who saw two major trends on a collision course on one hand the founders saw that what we called “websites” were in fact becoming online applications locations that were complex distributed and broad in scope of functionality on the other hand they saw that advancing mobile technology was leading end users to access these applications on new and different devices in addition to and even in place of their pcs today online businesses struggle to provide optimal digital experiences thanks to the continuing rise in complexity of apps and the requirement to deliver them to smaller and slower devices as a result end users’ expectations for online experiences now far outstrip the reality of what is delivered to them we call this discrepancy the “experience gap” yottaa’s mission is to help companies close the experience gap with an intelligent saas platform that accelerates and optimizes ecommerce websites across all devices     our people  culture the employees at yottaa are drawn to worldchanging technology our people thrive from seeing our customers’ success grow in real time and building technology to enable that growth at the core our people are rooted in the mantra of ltv – we want our customers to love trust and value us our technology is fantastic — patented awardwinning novel — but from our perspective none of that matters if we’re not helping our customers drive their businesses forward with real tangible gains yottaa helped us to significantly speed up ecommerce performance on all devices resulting in a much better experience for our
