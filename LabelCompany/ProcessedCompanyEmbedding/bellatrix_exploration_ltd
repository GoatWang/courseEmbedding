includes the trading statistics for the toronto stock exchange tsx and other canadian trading markets presidents message execution of our strategic three year development plan previously announced in january  began in earnest during the first quarter of  marking the resumption of bellatrixs long term profitable growth  the company delivered on its objectives exceeding the previously set full year  production guidance target and providing clear line of sight to deliver  compound annual growth in production volumes over the next three years  first quarter  performance included the following operational and financial achievements production volumes of  boed represented average volume growth of  compared with the previous quarter funds flow from operations of  million grew  compared with the previous quarter production expenditures of boe were reduced by boe or  from the previous quarter bellatrix has built a strong and sustainable business anchored by three pillars that provide the foundation for long term profitable growth  high quality assets and acreage  infrastructure ownership and control and  takeaway capacity and market egress high quality assets  acreage bellatrix is positioned to accelerate profitable growth of our large asset base as evidenced by our first quarter  operational performance  the core foundational assets for the company reside in a proven area of the deep basin in west central alberta known for its exceptional geologic and hydrocarbon bearing characteristics  bellatrix maintains a dominant core acreage position along the deep basin fairway with decades of development ready opportunities anchored by our large inventory of net identified spirit river and cardium well locations and the company retains significant torque to a higher crude oil price environment through its cardium position  the spirit river liquids rich natural gas play represents one of north americas lowest supply cost natural gas plays and delivers strong rates of return at current natural gas prices  rate of return expectations for the spirit river continue to rank among the highest within our portfolio of investment opportunities thereby attracting the majority of anticipated capital investment in   bellatrix has proven itself as a premier operator within the spirit river play consistently delivering industry leading well productivity results which drive strong rates of return for every capital dollar invested  to that end the first two wells completed in early february of bellatrixs  spirit river program ranked as two of the best wells in alberta during the month followed by the remaining first quarter program wells being completed and placed on stream at or above internal expectations  our top tier acreage position and material running room provide a key long term competitive advantage for the company infrastructure ownership and control infrastructure ownership operatorship and control creates significant barriers to competition within our core area thus ensuring operational flexibility and reliability to profitably process our production volumes and extract maximum value from each product stream since  bellatrix has invested approximately  million in strategic infrastructure assets within its core west central alberta area providing above ground control of the region and creating significant barriers to industry competition the capital build out for our long term growth strategy is nearly complete with investment in the bellatrix ochiese neesohpawganuck deepcut gas plant at alder flats the alder flats plant ownership in two other major natural gas processing plants operatorship and control of nine major compressor stations and direct operatorship in over  kilometres of strategic gathering systems and pipelines  bellatrixs historic investment in key strategic infrastructure and facilities provide the processing capacity and capability to grow net company production volumes beyond  boed with minimal future facility related capital  with the proportion of capital to facilities projects expected to materially reduce in  and beyond bellatrix anticipates directing incremental capital directly to the drill bit thereby enhancing already industry leading corporate capital efficiency metrics  takeaway capacity and market egress the third pillar that provides a key competitive advantage and underpins the companys long term profitable growth profile is ensuring ample takeaway capacity and market egress for our production volumes  bellatrix maintains several long term firm transportation ft agreements ensuring market egress for current and forecast production currently representing approximately  of current gross operated natural gas volumes at multiple receipt points on the nova gas transmission ltd the ngtl system  the ngtl system has experienced and is expected to experience further curtailments of both interruptible and firm service capacity as the operator continues work through  to expand capacity along the system  with excess ft relative to current production levels bellatrix is well positioned to deliver volumes with minimal impacts during periods of system curtailments  bellatrix previously negotiated additional ft capacity to facilitate increased growth volumes from phase  of its alder flats plant which provides additional strategic long term value for the company bellatrix also maintains firm service contracts through a number of third party processing plants in its greater core ferrier region to ensure unfettered delivery capability for current and planned production growth with staggered contract maturity dates to align with the inservice date of phase  of the alder flats plant  finally bellatrix has secured fractionation capacity for its natural gas liquids ngl volumes by way of long term agreements providing  coverage for current and forecast ngl volumes from both phase  and phase  of its alder flats plant  the foresight to obtain and control firm transportation along the main transmission system for not only current but also forecast growth volumes provides a key competitive long term advantage for the company enhanced our already strong risk management position bellatrix continued to protect its long term strategic plan by adding to its already strong risk management position during the first quarter of   bellatrix maintains approximately  of forecast gross natural gas volumes in  hedged at an average fixed price of approximately mcf based on the midpoint of the updated  average gross production guidance of  boed  natural gas weighted  in addition the company has in place material risk management protection in  with a total of  mmcfd of  natural gas volumes hedged at an average fixed price of approximately mcf this represents approximately  of volumes compared to the midpoint of the updated  full year average guidance strong propane prices in the first quarter of  provided an attractive opportunity for bellatrix to hedge  bbld of propane volumes at an average price of  of wti light oil prices from february through december of  and  bbld of propane volumes at an average price of  of wti light oil prices in  both meaningfully above long term historical averages  bellatrixs hedging program is part of its overall risk management strategy focused on providing reduced commodity price volatility and greater assurance over future revenue and cash flows which help drive the capital and reinvestment decisions within our business strong operational performance achieved in the first quarter of  bellatrix delivered strong operational performance through the first quarter of  first quarter average production of  boed  natural gas weighted surpassed the companys  prior average annual guidance midpoint estimate of  boed  with first quarter objectives solidly met bellatrix remains favourably positioned to deliver strong results through  with second quarter production levels currently exceeding management expectations  with strong operational performance and momentum bellatrix is increasing its  production guidance target as discussed in the outlook section of this release our focus on operational execution and delivery of our three year growth strategy was evident by the strong results achieved during the first quarter of   bellatrix participated in  gross  net wells in the first quarter which included  gross  net operated spirit river wells  gross  net operated cardium wells and also  gross  net nonoperated wells in the spirit river and ellerslie formations  of the ten gross operated wells drilled during the first quarter eight were brought onstream during the first three months of the year with the remaining operated spirit river well subsequently brought onstream in early april and the one remaining cardium operated well drilled and planned for completion and onstream delivery in the third quarter of   bellatrix completed its planned first quarter capital program with exploration and development expenditures of  million and an unchanged expectation to spend approximately half of the full years net capital expenditure budget of  million within the first six months of the year first quarter production expenses averaged boe representing a marked reduction of boe from the boe production expenditure level in the fourth quarter of   first quarter production expenditure levels and anticipated production and expense levels position bellatrix to maintain its full year average production expenditure guidance of

operational update with the conclusion of all joint venture drilling in  bellatrix has demonstrated the flexibility in  to balance infill development drilling and expanded core area development  the company remains focused on growing production adding reserves and increasing our inventory of development drilling locations  bellatrixs working interest in operated wells drilled in the first quarter

breakup period with exploration and development capital expenditures invested during the first quarter of  million  the companys capital expenditure plans remain on target and in line with previously stated guidance levels for  million in  with approximately  of capital expenditures to be invested within the first half of the year alder flats phase  expansion nearing completion which represents the final stage of the companys long term strategic infrastructure buildout the alder flats plant represents a highly strategic asset for the company as we continue to execute on our three year development plan to profitably grow production expand netbacks and grow cash flow  phase  of the alder flats plant has been onstream for  continuous months delivering an average  capacity utilization rate over that period and firmly establishing the bellatrix alder flats plant as the most efficient plant in our greater west central alberta core area the phase  expansion project which will more than double gross throughput capacity at the plant to  mmcfd from  mmcfd currently remains on time and on budget for completion in the second quarter of   the plant expansion is anticipated to drive improved revenue generation through additional higher margin ngl extraction and provide further reductions to corporate operating costs driving expanded corporate profit margins and cash flow  fabrication of all major equipment for phase  is complete including compressors and propane bullets  fabrication and packaging of other material equipment including the condensate stabilizer production tanks heat medium package and electrical equipment continues to progress according to plan and is expected to arrive on site for installation over the next several quarters  site construction activity will recommence late in the second quarter with scheduled pile driving activity anticipated to begin in june  major equipment will begin being delivered to site with installation activities and mechanical work planned to begin in the third quarter of   bellatrixs investment in strategic infrastructure assets within the greater ferrier and willesden green areas of west central alberta provide the above ground control of the region and create significant barriers to industry competition  the capital build out for our long term growth strategy is nearly complete given prior period investment in the alder flats plant major compressor stations and strategic gathering systems and pipelines  bellatrix forecasts net capital expenditures of approximately  million in  and  million in  excluding received partner prepayment required to complete phase  of the alder flats plant which will solidify our infrastructure control and provide the facilities and processing capacity to grow net production volumes beyond  boed with minimal future facility related capital completion of phase  of the alder flats plant which will add an incremental  mmcfd ownership capacity net to bellatrixs  working interest is expected to deliver a favourable step change reduction in operating costs down by approximately boe relative to current full year  average production expense guidance industry leading well results and continued capital cost suppression efforts bellatrix has established itself as a premier operator in west central alberta continuously delivering top tier well results from its spirit river development program through the first quarter of  coupled with continued capital cost reductions which in combination delivered another extremely capital efficient quarter  allin drill complete equip and tiein estimated well costs in the first quarter of  averaged  million unchanged from average costs of  million achieved in  despite modest upward pressure on select completion service costs in   bellatrix continues to supress costs and mitigate inflationary pressure on capital costs given structural and sustainable improvements achieved within both drilling and completion practices    enhanced liquidity position with borrowing base increased  subsequent to the end of the first quarter bellatrix amended and restated the terms of its syndicated revolving credit facilities the credit facilities effective may   the total commitments under the credit facilities were set at  million comprised of a  million operating facility provided by a canadian bank and a  million syndicated facility provided by four financial institutions  total commitments under the credit facilities were increased  relative to total commitments at year end   the borrowing base increase provides enhanced liquidity relative to prior levels while maintaining bellatrixs financial resources at a level that minimizes standby fees  the company remains committed to continued fiscal prudence and achieving near term growth objectives within current capital spending guidance levels other than the  million outstanding as at march   on the credit facilities the company has no debt maturities until  and  subsequent to the end of the first quarter  bellatrix completed two separate transactions whereby it monetized its  million vendor take back loan receivable

shares of bellatrix trade on the toronto stock exchange and on the new york stock exchange under the symbol bxe  nongaap measuresthroughout this press release the company uses terms that are commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry but do not have a standardized meaning presented by international financial reporting standards ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures for other entities management believes that the presentation of these nongaap measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis operating netbacks are calculated by subtracting royalties transportation and operating expenses from total revenue  management believes this measure is a useful supplemental measure of the amount of total revenue received after transportation royalties and operating expenses the companys calculation of total revenue includes petroleum and natural gas sales and other income and excludes commodity price risk management total capital expenditures – net includes the cash impact of capital expenditures and property dispositions as well as the noncash capital impacts of corporate acquisitions property acquisitions adjustments to the companys decommissioning liabilities and share based

decommissioning liabilities and share based compensation these measures have been described and presented in this news release in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with additional

terms that have been reconciled in the companys financial statements to the most comparable ifrs measures these terms do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculations of similar measures for other entities these terms have been referenced in the companys press release mda and financial statements these terms are used by management to analyze operating performance on a comparable basis with prior periods and to analyze the liquidity of the company this press release contains the term funds flow from operations which should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the companys performance therefore reference to funds flow from operations or funds flow from operations per share may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities management uses funds flow from operations to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the companys ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt  funds flow from operations is calculated as cash flow from operating activities excluding decommissioning costs incurred changes in noncash working capital incurred and transaction costs  the reconciliation between cash flow from operating activities and funds flow from operations can be found in the mda  funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares for the period this press release also contains the terms total net debt and adjusted working capital deficiency which also are not recognized measures under gaap therefore reference to total net debt and adjusted working capital deficiency may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities  the companys calculation of total net debt excludes other deferred liabilities deferred capital obligations longterm risk management contract liabilities decommissioning liabilities and deferred tax liabilities  total net debt includes the adjusted working capital deficiency long term loans receivable convertible debentures liability component current bank debt and long term bank debt  the adjusted working capital deficiency is calculated as net working capital deficiency excluding current risk management contract assets and liabilities current portion of other deferred liabilities current portion of deferred capital obligation and the current bank debt  management believes these measures are useful supplementary measures of the total amount of current and longterm debt forward looking statementscertain
