distributionscredit risk debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due  investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default  unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be

to meet their obligations should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposeslowquality bond risk the fund concentrates a large portion of its investments in lowquality bonds sometimes called “junk bonds” which have greater credit risk and generally are less liquid and have more volatile prices than higher quality securitiesleverage risk the

return is positive or negative leverage is intended to increase common share net income but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful  different forms of leverage
