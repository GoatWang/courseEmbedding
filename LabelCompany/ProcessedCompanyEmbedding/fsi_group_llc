financial services institute fsi spire investment partners llc and portfolio resources group inc announced that their independent financial advisors are now new fsi financial advisor members the financial advisors’ firstyear membership is offered on a complimentary basis by their firm dale brown fsi’s president  ceo said “everything we do is aimed at increasing our advocacy success regulators and lawmakers pay attention when our members their constituents are engaged in the policy making process once again our collective voice is growing stronger and more influential the momentum our members are creating speaks loudly that every independent financial advisor should join the fight to protect their business by becoming an fsi member” spire investment partners’ ceo david blisk said “spire has been a member of fsi since  because they are the only organization that advocates on behalf of independent financial services firms like us  dually registered and hybrid fsi shares our values and commitment to education and public awareness by representing spire with our regulators legislators and the investing public without fsi the best interests of our wealth advisors and clients would not be served” antonio camejo ceo and cochair of portfolio resources group inc said “a growing number of investors are beginning to understand that they can make an impact by voting their conscience with their investment dollars just like they do as consumers likewise as a firm we realized the importance of being part of an organization like fsi that gives voice to the interests of our specific sector of the financial services industry small independent advisors provide a critical service to the small investor an investor who might otherwise be disenfranchised from professional financial advice we look forward to a close collaborative effort with fsi to improve best practices in the industry and to reform where necessary misguided and burdensome regulatory mandates that negatively impact the ability of small firms to provide quality service the proliferation of rules that neither serve the interests of clients nor truly protect them requires an industry advocate like fsi” in addition to advocacy fsi financial advisor members receive access to analyses of regulatory and legislative proposals an advocacy action center and allinone mobile app to easily communicate
