controlling interest in such entities in contemplation of later completing an acquisition development stage company     based on the companys business plan it is a development stage company since

earnings loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if potentially dilutive securities are converted into common shares  potentially dilutive securities such as stock options and warrants are excluded from the calculation when their inclusion would be antidilutive such as periods when a net loss is reported or when the exercise price of the instrument exceeds the fair market value  during  and  the company has not issued any potentially dilutive securities use of estimates     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain  estimates that are critical to the accompanying financial statements include the identification and valuation of assets and liabilities valuation of deferred tax assets and the likelihood of loss contingencies  management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  estimates and assumptions are revised periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period it is determined to be necessary  actual results could differ from these estimates recently adopted accounting standards   the company evaluates the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations primarily the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and the emerging issues task force eitf to determine the impact of new pronouncements on us gaap and the impact on the company accounting standards codification  in september  fasb established the accounting standards codification asc as the single source of authoritative us gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities  rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants  the asc is a new structure which took existing accounting pronouncements and organized them by accounting topic  the asc did not change current us gaap but was intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the relevant literature related to a particular topic in one place  all previously existing accounting standards were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the asc is considered nonauthoritative  new accounting standards issued subsequent to september   will be communicated by the fasb through accounting standards updates asus  the asc was effective during the period ended september    adoption of the asc did not have an impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows the company has recently adopted the following new accounting standards subsequent events  in may  the asc guidance for subsequent events was updated to establish accounting and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued  the guidance was amended in february   the update sets forth i the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements ii the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet in its financial statements and iii the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  the amended asu was effective immediately and its adoption had no impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows    fair value measurements – in january  asu  amended existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels  and  in the fair value hierarchy adding separate disclosures about purchase sales issuances and settlements relative to level  measurements and clarifying among other things the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation the asu was adopted during the period ended september   and its adoption had no impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows consolidations – asu  revises the consolidation guidance for variableinterest entities the modifications include the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variableinterest entity and changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variableinterest entity the asu was adopted during the period ended september   and its adoption had no impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows recently issued accounting standards updates      the following accounting standards updates were recently issued and have not yet been adopted by the company  these standards are currently under review to determine their impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows asu no  was issued in march  and clarifies that the transfer of credit risk that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another is an embedded derivative feature that should not be subject to potential bifurcation and separate accounting  this asu will be effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after september   with early adoption permitted asu no  was issued in april  and will clarify the classification of an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying security trades  this asu will be effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december   with early adoption permitted there were various other accounting standards updates recently issued most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable only to specific industries  none of these additional recent updates are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position operations or cash flows      going concern the companys financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of obligations in the normal course of business  however the company has no business operations and has negative working capital and has a total stockholders deficit  these conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern in view of these matters continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the company which in turn is dependent upon the companys ability to meet its financial requirements raise additional capital and the success of its future operations  the financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the company not continue as a going concern management has opted to file the companys periodic financial reports with the sec and then to raise funds through a private placement  management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern
