safety a top priority the plant has made good progress in reducing the injury rate but now confronts the need to accelerate its improvement doing so requires the safety director to consider progress to date and analyze the opportunities for improvement many of which involve fundamental changes in behavior at all levels of the organization progress has not been uniform throughout the plant and

of modularity building complex products from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together as a whole modularity freed designers to experiment with different approaches

archival film footage of early assembly lines shows the wright brothers with their early airplane tells how the us gradually became a world leader in industry kim clark of harvard discusses current issues in industry and technology productivity growth and r  d at the business level  results from the pims data base by kim b clark book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide abstract this paper presents the results of a study of productivity growth and r  d in the s using data on narrowly defined business units within a firm estimates are developed under different assumptions about technology industry effects and changes in the return to r  d over time the r  d data are broken down into process and product expenditures and some information is available on past success in developing proprietary technology andontheincidenceofmaor changes in technology in the recent past the results suggest a significant relationship between r  d and the growth of productivity in versions using total factor productivity as the dependent variable the estimated rate of return to r  d investment is about  percent we find some evidence that r  d has its biggest effect on productivity in those markets where major changes in technology have occurred in the recent past previous success in developing proprietary process technology affects total factor productivity directly but appears to have little effect on estimated returns to r  d the notion that the productivity of r  d declined in the lsfinds little support in this data irrespective of model specification trends in the r  d coefficient are substantively arid statistically insignificant our calculations suggest that reduced investment in r  d may have accounted for at least  percent of the decline in total factor productivity growth in the ls unionization and firm performance  the impact on profits growth and productivity by kim b clark book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper examines the impact of unionization on profit ability growth and productivity using time series data on over  product line businesses in the north american manufacturing sector predominantly us the first section of the paper develops a simple theoretical framework for studying the effect of the union on firm performance a key result of this analysis is that information about union wage and productivity effects is not sufficient to permit prediction of the sign or magnitude of consequent changes in the rate of return on capital one must know the parameters of production and demand expanding the model to allow for the effects of market structure and alternative bargaining regimes establishes the need to examine several indicators of firm performance in assessing the impact of the union the empirical analysis reveals sizeable negative union effects on profitability but growth productivity and the capitallabor ratio appear to be little affected by unionization in this data the data are thus consistent with a model of unionfirm interaction in which collective bargaining affects the distribution of profits but leaves real magnitudes unchanged the evidence suggests however that unionization may have longer term implications for efficiency since the impact on profitability appears to fall most heavily on firms with relatively little market power red shirt kids by bryce clark book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide mike and amy smith are nervous about moving from their nice house in boston to a dilapidated old mansion in falton new hampshire they know theyll have to start the sixth and seventh grade not knowing anyone and their new house is just plain creepy while searching their dusty attic mike and amy uncover an old wooden chest with a mysterious lock inside they find magical red shirts that give them special powers together with a new friend sam mike

before it is too late labor force participation  timing and persistence by kim b clark book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper examines the relative importance of timing and persistence elements in explaining cyclical fluctuations in labor supply data from the natural experiment provided by world war i and crosssectional data on american local labor markets as well as aggregate timeseries data are used in the empirical work we find little evidence that timing effects play an important role in labor market dynamics the evidence suggests that views emphasizing persistence are more accurate and that previous employment tends to raise the probability of subsequent employment unemployment insurance and labor force transitions by kim b clark book  editions published between  and  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper reports preliminary estimates of an econometric simulation model capable of a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of unemployment insurance on measured and actual employment unemployment and nonparticipation the data are longitudinal comprising information on  households sampled in the current population surveys of march and april  the simulation model is constructed from multi nomial logit equations characterizing individuals labor force transitions these equations provide estimates of the effects of ui on job loss labor force exit and entry into the labor force as well as the effect of ui on unemployment duration and temporary layoffs the results are rather inconclusive but suggest the importance of further research on i and transitions in and out of the labor force unionization management adjustment and productivity by kim b clark book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the effect of unionization on productivity is examined in this paper using timeseries data on selected establishments in the us cement industry the analysis combines statistical estimation of the union impact and interviews with union and management officials to forge a link between econometric estimation and the traditional institutional analysis of union policy and management adjustment the econometric analysis primarily deals with the problem of identifying the impact of the union in the face of firm specific effects and adjustments in labor quality the case studies are designed to shed light on the question of how unionization affects productivity the empirical results support the conclusion that unionization leads to productive changes in the operation of the enterprise evidence from the case studies suggests that much of the gain in productivity derives from a series of extensive changes in management personnel and procedure these adjustments are a management response to changes in the employment contract which follow unionization labor force transitions and unemployment by kim b clark book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this paper challenges conventional views of unemployment its results suggest that failure to examine closely labor force transitions has led to a misleading picture of unemployment and the way the labor market functions in general there are four main conclusions first labor force transitions are the principal determinant of fluctuations in employment and unemployment we find that the vast majority of those newly employed come not from unemployment but from outside the labor force likewise most spells of employment end with labor force withdrawal rather than unemployment second traditional estimates of the duration of unemployment and the ease of job finding are seriously flawed by failure to take account of the  percent of all unemployment spells which end in labor force withdrawal third reentrant unemployment is to a large extent the result of jobending followed by a brief spell outside the labor force many reentrants would almost certainly be better classified as job losers and leavers completing long spells of unemployment rather than as entrants starting a new spell of unemployment fourth it appears that many of those counted as out of the labor force are functionally indistinguishable from the unemployed the perpetual

revolutionizing product development steven c wheelwright and kim b clark demonstrated how project leaders for product development could apply new innovations to bring products to market at breakneck speed now in their new work they address the general managers role in leading product development efforts  at the functional unit group and corporate levels up to now senior managers have merely approved or rejected proposals at the beginning of a project and rushed in at the end to resolve problems this traditional approach to product development no longer works the authors contend a fundamental shift in the role of senior management is taking place the entire spectrum of new product development is now the responsibility of the general manager  from preproject planning to completion wheelwright and clark draw on their combined consulting experience and numerous examples  such as kodak honda hewlettpackard and gillette  to explain how this new role can be successfully executed in todays competitive arena the authors show how the margin for error in new product development has become razor thin preproject planning they show takes the guesswork out of development so that projects run smoothly from start to finish second they describe how to choose a set of projects that match a companys specific strategic objectives resources and organizational horsepower  enabling the development of consistently successful products and capabilities over time finally they reveal how to create a plan for action how to determine project sequence what measurements and incentives are crucial and most important how to capture project learning and integrate it back into the ongoing stream of product development wheelwright and clark conclude that the opportunity for rapid significant development lies in managerial leadership of preproject planning and commitment to improvement at every step of the products life cycle they provide managers with the tools needed to master these processes making this book necessary reading for every manager who wants the upper hand in bringing timely efficient highquality new products to marketindustrial management production
