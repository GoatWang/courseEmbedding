great tickets at face value church is revamping the presale and onsale process to eliminate scalpers from the equation    “in this era where growing inequality seems to be the norm we wanted to do everything within our power to put the advantage back in the hands of true fans rather than those that take advantage of the system and by extension our people” said john peets church’s manager “it was important to us to invest time into evaluating and redesigning the ticket buying process and build the technology to level the playing field”    church has secured a larger allotment of fan club tickets than in the past so church choir members will have much better success buying tickets in the presale  the church choir presale will be the only presale there will be no venue credit card or

orders will be delayed until the days leading up to each show  church hopes that this will make it impossible for scalpers to complete their transactions    by doing this – investing time and energy to create a more efficient and balanced model – the church team is not only communicating directly to the fans the best source for face value tickets but also building a model that protects fans and can be adopted by the industry as a whole   “the way this album came together mandated we release it as a surprise straight to our fans as it was important for me to deliver the music the same way the creativity hit me—directly and swiftly what i didn’t anticipate is that it left me scratching my head a little as this year was supposed to be spent writing”  church continues “what this year’s open

httpswwwbiztimescomindustriesfoodbeverageericresch eric resch development director coowner founder and quality grader giri corp dba stone creek coffee  n fifth st milwaukee employees about  stonecreekcoffeecom resch stone creek coffee’s four coowners recently decided to expand the coffee business into madison and chicago as well as open new cafes in the milwaukee market stone creek will open a cafe in july in wauwatosa in november on downer avenue in milwaukee and two in chicago in spring  bringing the total to  stores biztimes managing editor molly dill caught up with eric resch founder and coowner of stone creek about the company’s growth streak how did you decide it was time to start expanding into other markets and how did you choose chicago and madison “why new markets why climb a mountain because it challenges you because it’s full of unknowns because it helps you grow “we chose madison and chicago ultimately because they were close to home we could drive there in a day we could visit our cafes we could serve our customers we could serve our stores out of the stone creek factory in milwaukee we do buy local fresh bakery in madison we’ll do the same thing in chicago and then at some point if our business continues to grow in chicago we would build a stone creek roastery and then potentially a stone creek kitchen that’s where we make all our coffeecentric foods” how does stone creek differentiate itself in a crowded coffee market “on the retail side of our business we focus on three primary things no  the quality of our coffee that we try to produce – we call it sweet clean and juicy the second is to build beautiful cafes – places that you want to come see and spend time the third is creating a very welcoming space and just having professional level baristas there every day all day to serve our customers “one other thing that is an umbrella statement we have a saying at stone creek that is ‘never stop learning’ it’s really a celebration of failure we welcome and encourage crazy ideas we’re willing to try things we prototype the ideas as quickly as we can” what are some examples of celebrated stone creek failures “for a while we actually had a fail wall – a wall where we would post big and small failures it would go from anything from the first time we shipped a container of coffee from tanzania it got lost and ended up in a port that we didn’t know it was going to and the coffee got too hot all the way to trying to develop a new coffee with rose petals on top that just didn’t work “failure is a strong word it’s more about encouraging new things trying new things they’re simply just exercises in learning” stone creek has a flat leadership structure has that become more challenging as the company has grown “we didn’t used to have that it was more of a traditional hierarchy we actually put this in place about three years ago because as the entrepreneur or the original founder of the company i was out of bandwidth now it’s sort of mass chaos with a reasonable amount of control and feedback loops it’s up to each team to accomplish their goals and we have a shared understanding of what their goals are but it’s up to them to go find the resources and the partners to accomplish those goals” has that structure ever backfired or been a challenge for you “i would say for me individually it’s been a challenge because i had to change my habits as the founder of the company i have a tendency to want to control things i think for some individuals who want to be told what to do it can feel unstructured and difficult because the structure rewards those who kind of stand up and go do something” shareclick to print opens in new windowclick to share on facebook opens in new windowclick to share on twitter

chicago as well as open new cafes in the milwaukee market stone creek will open a cafe in july in wauwatosa in november on downer avenue in milwaukee and two in chicago in spring  bringing the total to  stores biztimes managing editor molly dill caught up with eric resch founder and coowner of stone creek about the company’s growth streak how did you decide it was time to start expanding into other markets and how did you choose chicago and madison “why new markets why climb a mountain because it challenges you because it’s full of unknowns because it helps you grow “we chose madison and chicago ultimately because they were close to home we could drive there in a day we could visit our cafes we could serve our customers we could serve our stores out of the stone creek factory in milwaukee we do buy local fresh bakery in madison we’ll do the same thing in chicago and then at some point if our business continues to grow in chicago we would build a stone creek roastery and then potentially a stone creek kitchen that’s where we make all our coffeecentric foods” how does stone creek differentiate itself in a crowded coffee market “on the retail side of our business we focus on three primary things no  the quality of our coffee that we try to produce – we call it sweet clean and juicy the second is to build beautiful cafes – places that you want to come see and spend time the third is creating a very welcoming space and just having professional level baristas there every day all day to serve our customers “one other thing that is an umbrella statement we have a saying at stone creek that is ‘never stop learning’ it’s really a celebration of failure we welcome and encourage crazy ideas we’re willing to try things we prototype the ideas as quickly as we can” what are some examples of celebrated stone creek failures “for a while we actually had a fail wall – a wall where we would post big and small failures it would go from anything from the first time we shipped a container of coffee from tanzania it got lost and ended up in a port that we didn’t know it was going to and the coffee got too hot all the way to trying to develop a new coffee with rose petals on top that just didn’t work “failure is a strong word it’s more about encouraging new things trying new things they’re simply just exercises in learning” stone creek has a flat leadership structure has that become more challenging as the company has grown “we didn’t used to have that it was more of a traditional hierarchy we actually put this in place about three years ago because as the entrepreneur or the original founder of the company i was out of bandwidth now it’s sort of mass chaos with a reasonable amount of control and feedback loops it’s up to each team to accomplish their goals and we have a shared understanding of what their goals are but it’s up to them to go find the resources and the partners to accomplish those goals” has that structure ever backfired or been a challenge for you “i would say for me individually it’s been a challenge because i had to change my habits as the founder of the company i have a tendency to want to control things i think for some individuals who want to be told what to do it can feel unstructured and difficult because the structure rewards those who kind of stand up and go do something” comments are closed subscribe to enews
