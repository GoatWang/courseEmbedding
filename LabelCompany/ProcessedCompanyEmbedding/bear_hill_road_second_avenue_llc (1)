avenue water main replacement project a a a print send by email update  d’allessandro corp has completed installation of the new water main along phase a approximately  feet of main  the crews will begin switching buildings located within phase a off of the temporary main and connecting each service to the newly installed water main within the roadway  as the crews switch phase a over to the new main they will also begin switching the buildings located within phase b to the temporary water main  while each building is being switched over from one main to another a temporary loss of water service should be expected  this disruption of service should range from  hours as the crew completes the work  after water service is restored the highest faucet in each building should be run for  minutes to allow any air trapped in the pipes to work its way out of the line   the city of waltham has contracted d’allessandro corp of avon ma to replace the water main along bear hill road and second avenue the project will include installing a temporary bypass water main replacing approximately  feet of water main  fire hydrants and water services to buildings the project will be completed in  phases the limits of phase  are from  bear hill road to the intersection of bear hill road and second avenue phase  consists of second avenue from bear hill road to the intersection with winter street each phase is broken into smaller subphases to minimize the disruption of service to residents the project will consist of both night and day work during various phases daytime hours will be between am – pm  nighttime hours will be between pm – am during daytime hours there will be one traffic lane open in each direction nighttime hours will close the road to one lane with alternating flow of traffic it is recommended that residents give extra time to allow for the delays in traffic during the project your patience is greatly appreciated please see the attached plan showing the different phases and their anticipated start and finish dates a full set of plans may be viewed here if there are any questions or concerns please contact john martino of the engineering department by
