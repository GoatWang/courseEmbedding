for each  of proceeds which include interest are illustrated by a table in the policydesigner annuity   federal income tax matters this discussion of how federal income tax laws may affect investment in your variable annuity is based on our understanding of current laws as interpreted by the internal revenue service irs it is not intended as tax advice all information is subject to change without notice we make no attempt to review any state or local laws or to address estate or inheritance laws or other tax consequences of annuity ownership or receipt of distributions you should consult a competent tax adviser to learn how tax laws apply to your annuity interests section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code governs taxation of annuities in general and code section  provides rules regarding the tax treatment of variable annuities other code sections may also impact taxation of your variable annuity investment andor earnings  tax deferrals during accumulation period an important feature of variable annuities is taxdeferred treatment of earnings during the accumulation phase an individual owner is not taxed on increases in the value of a policy until a withdrawal occurs either in the form of a nonperiodic payment or as annuity payments under the settlement option selected ■ taxation of withdrawals withdrawals are included in gross income to the extent of any allocable income any amount in excess of the investment in the policy is allocable to income accordingly withdrawals are treated as coming first from the earnings then only after the income portion is exhausted as coming from principal if you make a withdrawal not only is the income portion of such a distribution subject to federal incometaxation but a  penalty may apply however the penalty does not apply to distributions  after the taxpayer reaches age    upon the death of the owner  if the taxpayer is defined as totally disabled  as periodic withdrawals that are a series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or for the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the taxpayer and the beneficiary  under an immediate annuity or  under certain other limited circumstances ■ taxation of annuity payments earnings from a variable annuity are taxable only upon withdrawal and are treated as ordinary income generally the code provides for the return of your investment in an annuity policy in equal taxfree amounts over the annuity payout period fixed annuity payment amounts may be excluded from taxable income based on the ratio of the investment in the policy to the total expected value of annuity payments if you elect variable annuity payments the amount excluded from taxable income is determined by dividing the investment in the policy by the total number of expected payments the balance of each payment is taxable income after you recover your investment in the policy any payment you receive is fully taxable if a variable payment is less than the excludable amount you should contact your tax adviser to determine how to report any investment not recovered the taxable portion of any annuity payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates ■ taxation of death proceeds a death benefit paid under the policy may be taxable income to the beneficiary the rules on taxation of an annuity apply estate taxes may also apply to your estate even if all or a portion of the benefit is subject to federal income taxes to be treated as an annuity a policy must provide that  if an annuitant dies a on or after the annuity starting date and b before the entire interest in the policy is distributed the balance will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method being used at the date of death and  if the annuitant dies before the annuity starting date the entire interest must be distributed within five years of death if distributed in a lump sum the death benefit amount is taxed in the same manner as a full withdrawal if the beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the owner it is possible to continue deferring taxes on the accrued and future income of the policy until payments are made to the surviving spousedesigner annuity   ■ tax treatment of assignments and transfers an assignment or pledge of an annuity policy is treated as a withdrawal also the code particularly fortaxqualified plans and erisa in some circumstances prohibit such transactions subjecting them to income taxpenalties and additional excise tax therefore you should consult a competent tax adviser if you wish to assign orpledge your policy■ tax treatments by type of owner a policy held by an entity other than a natural person such as a corporation estate or trust usually is nottreated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes the income on such a policy is taxable in the year received oraccrued by the owner however this rule does not apply if the owner is acting as an agent for an individual or is anestate that acquired the policy as a result of the death of the decedent nor does it apply if the policy is held bycertain qualified plans is held pursuant to a qualified funding trust structured settlement plan or if an employerpurchased the policy under a terminated qualified plan you should consult your tax adviser before purchasing apolicy to be owned by a nonnatural person■ annuity used to fund qualified plan the policy is designed for use with various qualified plans including  tax sheltered annuities code section b  individual retirement

for a qualifiedplan you should review the annuity features including all benefits and expenses prior to purchasing a variableannuity tax rules for qualified plans are very complex and vary according to the type and terms of the plan as wellas individual facts and circumstances each purchaser should obtain competent tax advice prior to purchasinga policy issued under a qualified plan the company reserves the right to limit the availability of the policy for use with any of the plans listedabove or to modify the policy to conform to tax requirements some retirement plans are subject to requirementsthat we have not incorporated into our administrative procedures unless we specifically consent we are not boundby plan requirements to the extent that they conflict with the terms of the policy on july   the internal revenue service irs published new regulations for tax sheltered annuitycontracts under internal revenue code section b while most of these provisions became effective january  the new regulations on taxfree exchanges of contracts became effective september   the new bregulations allow for the exchange of annuity contracts if the plan sponsor employer and the contract providerinsurance company agree to share certain information this contrasts with prior rules when a contract owneremployee and the insurers could complete an exchange without directly involving the plan sponsor therefore ameritas is suspending b exchanges both incoming and outgoing and b trusteetotrustee transfers until we have an information sharing agreement with the b plan sponsors that is consistentwith the new regulations we will follow the irs regulations to help assure that the steps we and your plansponsors take will maintain the taxdeferred nature of your b contract if you must discontinue your bannuity while exchanges are suspended you may submit paperwork to initiate a withdrawal or a rollover to an iraor to another qualified plan if a distributable

applicants state that replacement portfolios and current portfolios respective investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same a comparison of the investment objectives strategies and risks of the replacement portfolio and the current portfolio is included in the application  the following table compares the fees and expenses of the current portfolio and the

investment advisor cim has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through april   to  under the terms of the contractual expense limitation operating expenses do not include interest expense brokerage commissions taxes and extraordinary expenses only the board of directors of cvsi may terminate a portfolios expense cap before the contractual period expires the advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of  or  for net operating expenses of  to maintain a positive yield during the year ended december    the applicants state that the proposed substitution is in response to a decision by the board of directors for cvsi at a meeting held on june   to approve the dissolution of the current portfolio on or about november   the “liquidation date” the boards decision to liquidate the current portfolio requires the life insurance companies to transfer accumulated contract value invested in the current portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the contracts on or before the liquidation date currently the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the contracts is the current portfolio accordingly the proposed substitution is necessary in order to provide the contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option consequently the life insurance companies have determined to replace the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio via the substitution  the life insurance companies submit that the replacement portfolio is an appropriate alternative for contract owners for several reasons first its investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the current portfolio second it is substantially larger than the current portfolio has had lower overall expense levels than the portfolio in recent years and has had higher yields in recent years than the current portfolio third the contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the life insurance companies currently offer one or more vipfv portfolios other than the replacement portfolio  the applicants believe that contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the replacement portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the replacement portfolio as contrasted start printed page with the size and recent yields of the current portfolio the yield for the current portfolio for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the current portfolio was  as of december   the yield for the replacement portfolio initial class shares for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the replacement portfolio supporting initial class shares was  as of december    the applicants believe that contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the replacement portfolio as compared to the current portfolio specifically the management fee other expenses and total operating expenses are less than those of the current portfolio both portfolios have no charge for rule b distribution and services fees the total annual operating expense of the replacement portfolio is less than that of the current portfolio given this decrease the applicants believe that the substitution would benefit contract owners by reducing the overall level of portfolio expenses legal analysis and conditions  the applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitution section c of the  act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is not the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of a proposed substitution which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption consequently the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption  applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include section c  applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the current portfolio and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio will be effected in accordance with section c of the act and rule c thereunder the substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the substitution “effective date” with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable account  contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio will be transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the substitution nor will their rights or the life insurance companies respective obligations under the contracts be altered in any way and the substitution will not change contract owners insurance benefits under the contracts all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by the life insurance companies in addition the substitution will not impose any tax liability on contract owners  the applicants also represent that the substitution will not cause the contract fees and charges currently paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution the life insurance companies will not exercise any right they may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the contracts for the period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice defined below through at least thirty  days following the effective date  existing contract owners will be notified of the proposed substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the contracts “presubstitution notice” at least thirty  days before the effective date new purchasers of the contracts will be provided the presubstitution notice the contract prospectus and the prospectus for the replacement portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements  the presubstitution notice will i state that the

portfolio would be attributable to the replacement portfolio as of the effective date iv state that from the date of the presubstitution notice until the effective date contract owners are permitted

limitations and fees that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the contract v advise contract owners that any contract value remaining in the current portfolio subaccount on the effective date will be transferred to a subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio and that the substitution will take place at relative net asset value vi inform contract owners that for at least thirty  days following the effective date the applicable life insurance company will permit contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio to any other available subaccounts offered under their contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees if any that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the contracts and vii inform contract owners that except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus the applicable life insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio for at least thirty  days after the effective date  all contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement portfolio prior to the substitution in addition within five  days following the substitution contract owners affected by the substitution will be notified in writing that the substitution was carried out this notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the presubstitution notice and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio were transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge start printed page including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge  the applicants represent that the life insurance companies will not receive for three  years after the effective date any direct or indirect benefits from the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates in connection with assets attributable to the contracts affected by the substitution at a higher rate than the life insurance companies had received from the current portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates including without limitation b fees revenue sharing or other arrangements the applicants further represent that the substitution and the selection of the replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a life insurance company or its affiliates by the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates  applicants submit that the replacement of the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and thus meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to section c of the  act in addition the applicants submit that the proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to substitutions that have been approved in the past conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application the applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in section c of the  act and should therefore be granted start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority
