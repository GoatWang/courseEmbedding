on the wall then yes there should be cohesion to your frames they dont have to be identical frames but their colors should be consistent for example variations of black frames this way the focus is on the artwork or the photography rather than on the huge assortment of frames however if you are adding singular pieces dispersed throughout a room than you can use different frames each artwork should have the most suitable frame complimenting it and the rooms decor if the frames happen to match than thats great but they dont have to be identical throughout the entire room show off your personality

then you are probably using internet explorer  or internet explorer  to fix this problem you will need to put your browser in compatibly mode see instructions below alternatively you can view the pages in chrome or firefox as they should display properly in the latest versions of those browsers without any additional steps on your part put internet explorer  in compatibility mode look to the right side of the address bar at the top of the internet explorer window you should see an icon that looks like a piece of paper torn in half click on this and you have put the browser in

answer  no long answer with explanation  im not trying to be a jerk with the previous two answers but the answer really is no heres why my first priority is always to help the students who have paid to be in one of my classes here at lamar university that is my job after all i also have quite a few duties in my department that keep me quite busy at times all this means that i just dont have a lot of time to be helping random folks who contact me via this website i would love to be able to help everyone but the reality is that i just dont have the time so because i cant help everyone who contacts me for help i dont answer any of the emails asking for help also when i first started this site i did try to help as many as i could and quickly found that for a small group of people i was becoming a free tutor and was constantly being barraged with questions and requests for help unfortunately there were a small number of those as well that were very demanding of my time and generally did not understand that i was not going to be available  hoursday  daysweek for help i really got tired of dealing with those kinds of people and that was one of the reasons along with simply getting busier here at lamar that made me decide to quit answering any email asking for help so while id like to answer all emails for help i cant and so im sorry to say that all emails requesting help will be ignored where are the answerssolutions to the assignment problems show answer  answersolutions to the assignment problems do not exist those are intended for use by instructors to assign for homework problems if they want to having solutions and for many instructors even just having the answers readily available would defeat the purpose of the problems please do not email asking for the solutionsanswers as you wont get them from me how do i download pdf versions of the pages show answer  there are a variety of ways to download pdf versions of the material on the site from content page if you are on a particular content page hoverclick on the downloads menu item you will be presented with a variety of links for pdf files associated with the page you are on included in the links will be links for the full chapter and ebook of the page you are on if applicable as well as links for the notes practice problems solutions to the practice problems and assignment problems the links for the page you are on will be highlighted so you can easily find them from download page all pdfs available for download can be found on the download page links to the download page can be found in the download menu the misc links menu and at the bottom of each page once on the download page simply select the topic you wish to download pdfs from this will present you with another menu in which you can select the specific page you wish to download pdfs for once you have made a selection from this second menu up to four links depending on whether or not practice and assignment problems are available for that page will show up below the second menu that you can click on to initiate the download from site map page the site map page for the site will contain a link for every pdf that is available for downloading you can access the site map page from the misc links menu or from the link at the bottom of every page note for internet explorer users if you are using internet explorer in all likelihood after clicking on a link to initiate a download a gold bar will appear at the bottom of your browser window that will allow you to open the pdf file or save it ive found a typo in the material show answer  if you have found a typo or mistake on a page them please contact me and let me know of the typomistake please be as specific as possible in your report let me know what page you are on and just what you feel the typomistake is its kind of hard to find the potential typo if all you write is the  in problem  should be a  and yes ive gotten handful of typo reports like that some of the equations are too small for me to see show answer  this is a problem with some of the equations on the site unfortunately it is especially true for some exponents and occasionally a double prime nd derivative notation will look like a single prime you can click on any equation to get a larger view of the equation clicking on the larger equation will make it go away if you are a mobile device especially a phone then the equations will appear very small i am attempting to find a way around this but it is a function of the program that i use to convert the source documents to web pages and so im somewhat limited in what i can do i am hoping they update the program in the future to address this in the mean time you can sometimes get the pages to show larger versions of the equations if you flip your phone into landscape mode another option for many of the small equation issues mobile or otherwise is to download the pdf versions of the pages these often do not suffer from the same problems is there any way to get a printable version of the solution to a particular practice problem show answer  yes if you want a printable version of a single problem solution all you need to do is click on the solution link next to the problem to get the solution to show up in the solution pane and then from the solution pane options select printable version and a printable version of that solution will appear in a new tab of your browser calculus ii notes  vectors  cross product   notes practice problems assignment problems calculus ii  notes series  sequences previous chapter   next chapter dimensional space dot product previous section   next section dimensional space introduction  cross product in this final section of this chapter we will look at the cross product of two vectors  we should note that the cross product requires both of the vectors to be three dimensional vectors    also before getting into how to compute these we should point out a major difference between dot products and cross products  the result of a dot product is a number and the result of a cross product is a vector  be careful not to confuse the two   so let’s start with the two vectors  and  then the cross product is given by the formula       this is not an easy formula to remember  there are two ways to derive this formula  both of them use the fact that the cross product is really the determinant of a x matrix  if you don’t know what this is that is don’t worry about it  you don’t need to know anything about matrices or determinants to use either of the methods  the notation for the determinant is as follows                                                                             the first row is the standard basis vectors and must appear in the order given here  the second row is the components of  and the third row is the components of   now let’s take a look at the different methods for getting the formula   the first method uses the method of cofactors  if you don’t know the method of cofactors that is fine the result is all that we need  here is the formula                                              where                                                                this formula is not as difficult to remember as it might at first appear to be  first the terms alternate in sign and notice that the x is missing the column below the standard basis vector that multiplies it as well as the row of standard basis vectors   the second method is slightly easier however many textbooks don’t cover this method as it will only work on x determinants  this method says to take the determinant as listed above and then copy the first two columns onto the end as shown below       we now have three diagonals that move from left to right and three diagonals that move from right to left  we multiply along each diagonal and add those that move from left to right and subtract those that move from right to left   this is best seen in an example  we’ll also use this example to illustrate a fact about cross products   example   if  and  compute each of the following a   b   solution a  here is the computation for this one                  b and here is the computation for this one                    notice that switching the order of the vectors in the cross product simply changed all the signs in the result  note as well that this means that the two cross products will point in exactly opposite directions since they only differ by a sign  we’ll formalize up this fact shortly when we list several facts   there is also a geometric interpretation of the cross product  first we will let θ  be the angle between the two vectors  and  and assume that  then we have the following fact  and the following figure   there should be a natural question at this point  how did we know that the cross product pointed in the direction that we’ve given it here    first as this figure implies the cross product is orthogonal to both of the original vectors  this will always be the case with one exception that we’ll get to in a second   second we knew that it pointed in the upward direction in this case by the “right hand rule”  this says that if we take our right hand start at  and rotate our fingers towards  our thumb will point in the direction of the cross product  therefore if we’d sketched in  above we would have gotten a vector in the downward direction   example   a plane is defined by any three points that are in the plane  if a plane contains the points   and  find a vector that is orthogonal to the plane   solution the one way that we know to get an orthogonal vector is to take a cross product  so if we could find two vectors that we knew were in the plane and took the cross product of these two vectors we know that the cross product would be orthogonal to both the vectors  however since both the vectors are in the plane the cross product would then also be orthogonal to the plane   so we need two vectors that are in the plane  this is where the points come into the problem since all three points lie in the plane any vector between them must also be in the plane  there are many ways to get two vectors between these points  we will use the following two                                                  the cross product of these two vectors will be orthogonal to the plane  so let’s find the cross product                                                      so the vector  will be orthogonal to the plane containing the three points   now let’s address the one time where the cross product will not be orthogonal to the original vectors  if the two vectors  and  are parallel then the angle between them is either  or  degrees  from  this implies that         from a fact about the magnitude we saw in the first section we know that this implies   in other words it won’t be orthogonal to the original vectors since we have the zero vector  this does give us another test for parallel vectors however   fact if  then  and  will be parallel vectors   let’s also formalize up the fact about the cross product being orthogonal to the original vectors   fact provided  then  is orthogonal to both  and    here are some nice properties about the cross product   properties if   and  are vectors and c is a number then                        the determinant in the last fact is computed in the same way that the cross product is computed  we will see an example of this computation shortly   there are a couple of geometric applications to the cross product as well  suppose we have three vectors   and  and we form the three dimensional figure shown below   the area of the parallelogram two dimensional front of this object is given by         and the volume of the parallelepiped the whole three dimensional object is given by       note that the absolute value bars are required since the quantity could be negative and volume isn’t negative   we can use this volume fact to determine if three vectors lie in the same plane or not  if three vectors lie in the same plane then the volume of the parallelepiped will be zero   example   determine if the three vectors   and  lie in the same plane or not   solution so as we noted prior to this example all we need to do is compute the volume of the parallelepiped formed by these three vectors  if the volume is zero they lie in the same plane and if the volume isn’t zero they don’t lie in the same plane                      so the volume is zero and so they lie in the same plane dot
