dividing functionsnext tutorialcomposing functionstagsmultiplying and dividing functionsvideo transcriptf of x is equal to x minus  g of x is equal to x to the third power plus x and then they ask us to find f times g of x so the first thing to realize is that this notation f times g of x is just referring to a function that is a product of f of x and g of x so by definition this notation just means f of x times g of x and then we just have to substitute f of x with this definition g of x with this definition and then multiply out these algebraic expressions f of x is right over there and g of x is right over there so lets do it so this is going to be equal to switch back to the orange color its going to be equal to f of x which is x minus  times g of x and g of x is x to the third power plus x and you could were multiplying two expressions that each have two terms you could use foil if you like i dont like using foil because you might forget what its even about foil is really just using the distributive property twice so for example you take this expression whatever you have out here if you had a  out here or an a or an x or anything now you have x minus  if youre multiplying it times this expression you would multiply this times each term over here so when you multiply x minus  times x to the third you get ill write it this way you get x to the third times actually let me write it the other way you get x minus  times x to the third and then you have plus x minus  times x and now we can do the distributive property again were not normally used to seeing the things we distribute on the right hand side its the same exact idea we could put the x to the third here as well and when we distribute you multiply x to the third times x and times negative  x to the third times x is x to the fourth power x to the third times negative  is minus x to the third and then you do it over here you distribute the x over the x x times x is plus x squared x times negative  is minus x and lets see if we can simplify this we only have one fourth degree term one third degree term one second degree term and one first degree term actually we cant simplify this anymore and were done this is the product of those two function definitions this is f times g of x it is a new function created by multiplying the other two functionsadding and subtracting functionsdividing
