survivor immigrated to the united states and established his own outerwear company located in the heart of new york city’s garment district  as early as  giii began to diversify its offerings when morris goldfarb its current chief executive officer and son of its founder joined giii  morris introduced an entrepreneurial spirit to giii which has propelled the company for more than forty years  almost immediately giii expanded its sourcing becoming one of the first companies to import outerwear from south korea  this established a strong connection between giii and the pacific rim manufacturing zone which remains intact today in  giii began expanding by launching its first division siena leather limited an aspirational luxury leather sportswear company that catered to highend department stores  in  giii became publicly traded and began intensifying its expansion efforts the early ’s was a period of rapid growth for giii as it worked to broaden its outerwear offerings  beginning  with the colebrook  co label  giii launched a textile outerwear collection  in addition giii began manufacturing men’s outerwear also under the colebrook  co label  in order to further giii’s reach it started producing licensed merchandise for the national football league through a partnership with twotime super bowl champion linebacker carl banks  when giii recognized the consumer’s preference for  name brands the company began partnering with nationally recognized brands such as kenneth cole jones new york nine west and  cole haan to produce branded outerwear under license agreements  by partnering with these national brands giii altered the landscape of how outerwear was marketed and sold in department stores in  the united states giii continued to license nationally recognized brands throughout the ’s in order to fill out a matrix of both men’s and women’s products  seeking to expand on the success of its partnership with the national football league the company established agreements with other sports organizations such as the national basketball association major league baseball national hockey league and over  us colleges and universities in july  giii acquired two very important businesses on the same day  by purchasing marvin richards and winlit giii consolidated with two of its largest competitors and set the stage for a transformation of giii which included a significant expansion of management merchandising manufacturing and design expertise  an immediate benefit of the marvin richards acquisition was the addition of licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the calvin klein brand name  the purchase of winlit granted giii licenses for men’s and women’s outerwear under the guess brand name  these extra licenses propelled giii to the forefront of the outerwear business  the acquisition of marvin richards had other benefits as well as giii expanded its calvin klein offerings to include women’s suits dresses performance wear sportswear handbags luggage and cold weather accessories  giii has become the second largest licensee for the calvin klein brand in  giii added to its dress portfolio with the acquisitions of jessica howard and eliza j  at the same time giii expanded its license agreement with ellen tracy to include the production of women’s suits and dresses  these assets allowed giii to establish itself as a powerhouse in the dress market  by  giii was manufacturing and shipping dresses under the following brand names…andrew marc calvin klein eliza j ellen tracy guess jessica howard jessica simpson kensie marc new york and vince camuto  giii is now one of the most dominant dress manufacturers in the united states in february  giii purchased andrew marc a wellknown brand  andrew marc established in  was a nationally recognized aspirational luxury outerwear company  giii sought to develop andrew marc into a meaningful lifestyle brand and as a result giii became a licensor for the first time  andrew marc now has license agreements for a number of different product categories  giii has also used its in house capabilities to expand andrew marc to additional categories such as dresses women’s handbags and men’s denim and related sportswear  in  entering the retail arena giii purchased the wilsons leather retail outlet chain which now includes over  stores in over  states the expertise of the wilsons team has allowed giii to expand retail with the opening of a limited number of andrew marc outlet stores and calvin klein performance stores continuing diversification efforts giii seeks to broaden the company’s reach in crucial areas  for example building on the company’s license to produce calvin klein sportswear giii entered into an agreement in  to design and manufacture
