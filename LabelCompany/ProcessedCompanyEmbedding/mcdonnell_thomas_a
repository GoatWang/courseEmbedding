states syllabus mcdonnell v united states certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit no – argued april  —decided june   petitioner former virginia governor robert mcdonnell and his wife maureen mcdonnell were indicted by the federal government on honest services fraud and hobbs act extortion charges related to their acceptance of  in loans gifts and other benefits from virginia businessman jonnie williams while governor mcdonnell was in office williams was the chief executive officer of star scientific a virginiabased company that had developed anatabloc a nutritional supplement made from anatabine a compound found in tobacco star scientific hoped that virginia’s public universities would perform research studies on anatabine and williams wanted governor mcdonnell’s assistance in obtaining those studies to convict the mcdonnells the government was required to show that governor mcdonnell committed or agreed to commit an “official act” in exchange for the loans and gifts an “official act” is defined as “any decision or action on any question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy which may at any time be pending or which may by law be brought before any public official in such official’s official capacity or in such official’s place of trust or profit”  u s c §a according to the government governor mcdonnell committed at least five “official acts” including “arranging meetings” for williams with other virginia officials to discuss star scientific’s product “hosting” events for star scientific at the governor’s mansion and “contacting other government officials” concerning the research studies the case was tried before a jury the district court instructed the jury that “official act” encompasses “acts that a public official customarily performs” including acts “in furtherance of longerterm goals” or “in a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end” supp app – governor mcdonnell requested that the court further instruct the jury that “merely arranging a meeting attending an event hosting a reception or making a speech are not standing alone ‘official acts’ ” but the district court declined to give that instruction  f d   internal quotation marks omitted the jury convicted governor mcdonnell governor mcdonnell moved to vacate his convictions on the ground that the definition of “official act” in the jury instructions was erroneous he also moved for acquittal arguing that there was insufficient evidence to convict him and that the hobbs act and honest services statute were unconstitutionally vague the district court denied the motions and the fourth circuit affirmed held  an “official act” is a decision or action on a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” that question or matter must involve a formal exercise of governmental power and must also be something specific and focused that is “pending” or “may by law be brought” before a public official to qualify as an “official act” the public official must make a decision or take an action on that question or matter or agree to do so setting up a meeting talking to another official or organizing an event—without more—does not fit that definition of “official act” pp – a the government argues that the term “official act” encompasses nearly any activity by a public official concerning any subject including a broad policy issue such as virginia economic development governor mcdonnell in contrast contends that statutory context compels a more circumscribed reading taking into account text precedent and constitutional concerns the court rejects the government’s reading and adopts a more bounded interpretation of “official act” pp – b section a sets forth two requirements for an “official act” first the government must identify a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” that “may at any time be pending” or “may by law be brought” before a public official second the government must prove that the public official made a decision or took an action “on” that “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” or agreed to do so pp –  the first inquiry is whether a typical meeting call or event is itself a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” the terms “cause” “suit” “proceeding” and “controversy” connote a formal exercise of governmental power such as a lawsuit hearing or administrative determination although it may be difficult to define the precise reach of those terms a typical meeting call or event does not qualify “question” and “matter” could be defined more broadly but under the familiar interpretive canon noscitur a sociis a “word is known by the company it keeps” jarecki v g d searle  co  u s  because a typical meeting call or event is not of the same stripe as a lawsuit before a court a determination before an agency or a hearing before a committee it does not count as a “question” or “matter” under §a that more limited reading also comports with the presumption “that statutory language is not superfluous” arlington central school dist bd of ed v murphy  u s  n  pp –  because a typical meeting call or event is not itself a question or matter the next step is to determine whether arranging a meeting contacting another official or hosting an event may qualify as a “decision or action” on a different question or matter that first requires the court to establish what counts as a question or matter in this case section a states that the question or matter must be “pending” or “may by law be brought” before “any public official” “pending” and “may by law be brought” suggest something that is relatively circumscribed—the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda tracked for progress and then checked off as complete “may by law be brought” conveys something within the specific duties of an official’s position although the district court determined that the relevant matter in this case could be considered at a much higher level of generality as “virginia business and economic development” supp app  the pertinent matter must instead be more focused and concrete the fourth circuit identified at least three such questions or matters  whether researchers at virginia’s state universities would initiate a study of anatabloc  whether virginia’s tobacco commission would allocate grant money for studying anatabine and  whether virginia’s health plan for state employees would cover anatabloc the court agrees that those qualify as questions or matters under §a pp –  the question remains whether merely setting up a meeting hosting an event or calling another official qualifies as a decision or action on any of those three questions or matters it is apparent from united states v sundiamond growers of cal  u s  that the answer is no something more is required §a specifies that the public official must make a decision or take an action on the question or matter or agree to do so for example a decision or action to initiate a research study would qualify as an “official act” a public official may also make a decision or take an action by using his official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an “official act” or by using his official position to provide advice to another official knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an “official act” by another official a public official is not required to actually make a decision or take an action on a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” it is enough that he agree to do so setting up a meeting hosting an event or calling an official or agreeing to do so merely to talk about a research study or to gather additional information however does not qualify as a decision or action on the pending question of whether to initiate the study pp – c the government’s expansive interpretation of “official act” would raise significant constitutional concerns conscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents contact other officials on their behalf and include them in events all the time representative government assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act appropriately on their concerns the government’s position could cast a pall of potential prosecution over these relationships this concern is substantial as recognized by white house counsel from every administration from that of president reagan to president obama as well as two bipartisan groups of former state attorneys general the government’s interpretation also raises due process and federalism concerns pp –  given the court’s interpretation of “official act” the district court’s jury instructions were erroneous and the jury may have convicted governor mcdonnell for conduct that is not unlawful because the errors in the jury instructions are not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt the court vacates governor mcdonnell’s convictions pp – a the jury instructions lacked important qualifications rendering them significantly overinclusive first they did not adequately explain to the jury how to identify the pertinent “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” it is possible the jury thought that a typical meeting call or event was itself a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” if so the jury could have convicted governor mcdonnell without finding that he committed or agreed to commit an “official act” as properly defined second the instructions did not inform the jury that the “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” must be more specific and focused than a broad policy objective as a result the jury could have thought that the relevant “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” was something as nebulous as virginia economic development and convicted governor mcdonnell on that basis third the district court did not instruct the jury that to convict governor mcdonnell it had to find that he made a decision or took an action—or agreed to do so—on the identified “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” as properly defined at trial several of governor mcdonnell’s subordinates testified that he asked them to attend a meeting not that he expected them to do anything other than that if that testimony reflects what governor mcdonnell agreed to do at the time he accepted the loans and gifts from williams then he did not agree to make a decision or take an action on any of the three questions or matters described by the fourth circuit pp – b governor mcdonnell raises two additional claims first he argues that the honest services statute and the hobbs act are unconstitutionally vague the court rejects that claim for purposes of this case the parties defined those statutes with reference to § of the federal bribery statute because the court interprets the term “official act” in §a in a way that avoids the vagueness concerns raised by governor mcdonnell it declines to invalidate those statutes under the facts here second governor mcdonnell argues that there is insufficient evidence that he committed an “official act” or agreed to do so because the parties have not had an opportunity to address that question in light of the court’s interpretation of “official act” the court leaves it for the court of appeals to resolve in the first instance pp –  f d  vacated and remanded roberts c j delivered the opinion for a unanimous court top opinion notice this opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports readers are requested to notify the reporter of decisions supreme court of the united states washington d c  of any typographical or other formal errors in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press supreme court of the united states  no –  robert f mcdonnell petitioner vunited states on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit june   chief justice roberts delivered the opinion of the court in  the federal government indicted former virginia governor robert mcdonnell and his wife maureen mcdonnell on bribery charges the charges related to the acceptance by the mcdonnells of  in loans gifts and other benefits from virginia businessman jonnie williams while governor mcdonnell was in office williams was the chief executive officer of star scientific a virginiabased company that had developed a nutritional supplement made from anatabine a compound found in tobacco star scientific hoped that virginia’s public universities would perform research studies on anatabine and williams wanted governor mcdonnell’s assistance in obtaining those studies to convict the mcdonnells of bribery the government was required to show that governor mcdonnell committed or agreed to commit an “official act” in exchange for the loans and gifts the parties did not agree however on what counts as an “official act” the government alleged in the indictment and maintains on appeal that governor mcdonnell committed at least five “official acts” those acts included “arranging meetings” for williams with other virginia officials to discuss star scientific’s product “hosting” events for star scientific at the governor’s mansion and “contacting other government officials” concerning studies of anatabine supp app – the government also argued more broadly that these activities constituted “official action” because they related to virginia business development a priority of governor mcdonnell’s administration governor mcdonnell contends that merely setting up a meeting hosting an event or contacting an official—without more—does not count as an “official act” at trial the district court instructed the jury according to the government’s broad understanding of what constitutes an “official act” and the jury convicted both governor and mrs mcdonnell on the bribery charges the fourth circuit affirmed governor mcdonnell’s conviction and we granted review to clarify the meaning of “official act” i a on november   petitioner robert mcdonnell was elected the st governor of virginia his campaign slogan was “bob’s for jobs” and his focus in office was on promoting business in virginia as governor mcdonnell spoke about economic development in virginia “on a daily basis” and attended numerous “events ribbon cuttings” and “plant facility openings” app   he also referred thousands of constituents to meetings with members of his staff and other government officials according to longtime staffers governor mcdonnell likely had more events at the virginia governor’s mansion to promote virginia business than had occurred in “any other administration” id at  this case concerns governor mcdonnell’s interactions with one of his constituents virginia businessman jonnie williams williams was the ceo of star scientific a virginiabased company that developed and marketed anatabloc a nutritional supplement made from anatabine a compound found in tobacco star scientific hoped to obtain food and drug administration approval of anatabloc as an antiinflammatory drug an important step in securing that approval was initiating independent research studies on the health benefits of anatabine star scientific hoped virginia’s public universities would undertake such studies pursuant to a grant from virginia’s tobacco commission governor mcdonnell first met williams in  when williams offered mcdonnell transportation on his private airplane to assist with mcdonnell’s election campaign shortly after the election williams had dinner with governor and mrs mcdonnell at a restaurant in new york the conversation turned to mrs mcdonnell’s search for a dress for the inauguration which led williams to offer to purchase a gown for her governor mcdonnell’s counsel later instructed williams not to buy the dress and mrs mcdonnell told williams that she would take a rain check id at – in october  governor mcdonnell and williams met again on williams’s plane during the flight williams told governor mcdonnell that he “needed his help” moving forward on the research studies at virginia’s public universities and he asked to be introduced to the person that he “needed to talk to” id at – governor mcdonnell agreed to introduce williams to dr william hazel virginia’s secretary of health and human resources williams met with dr hazel the following month but the meeting was unfruitful dr hazel was skeptical of the science behind anatabloc and did not assist williams in obtaining the studies id at – – six months later governor mcdonnell’s wife maureen mcdonnell offered to seat williams next to the governor at a political rally shortly before the event williams took mrs mcdonnell on a shopping trip and bought her  worth of designer clothing the mcdonnells later had williams over for dinner at the governor’s mansion where they discussed research studies on anatabloc id at  two days after that dinner williams had an article about star scientific’s research emailed to mrs mcdonnell which she forwarded to her husband less than an hour later governor mcdonnell texted his sister to discuss the financial situation of certain rental properties they owned in virginia beach governor mcdonnell also emailed his daughter to ask about expenses for her upcoming wedding the next day williams returned to the governor’s mansion for a meeting with mrs mcdonnell at the meeting mrs mcdonnell described the family’s financial problems including their struggling rental properties in virginia beach and their daughter’s wedding expenses mrs mcdonnell who had experience selling nutritional supplements told williams that she had a background in the area and could help him with anatabloc according to williams she explained that the “governor says it’s okay for me to help you and—but i need you to help me i need you to help me with this financial situation” id at  mrs mcdonnell then asked williams for a  loan in addition to a  gift to help pay for her daughter’s wedding and williams agreed williams testified that he called governor mcdonnell after the meeting and said “i understand the financial problems and i’m willing to help i just wanted to make sure that you knew about this” id at  according to williams governor mcdonnell thanked him for his help ibid governor mcdonnell testified in contrast that he did not know about the loan at the time and that when he learned of it he was upset that mrs mcdonnell had requested the loan from williams id at – three days after the meeting between williams and mrs mcdonnell governor mcdonnell directed his assistant to forward the article on star scientific to dr hazel in june  williams sent mrs mcdonnell’s chief of staff a letter containing a proposed research protocol for the anatabloc studies the letter was addressed to governor mcdonnell and it suggested that the governor “use the attached protocol to initiate the ‘virginia study’ of anatabloc at the medical college of virginia and the university of virginia school of medicine” id at  governor mcdonnell gave the letter to dr hazel id at – williams testified at trial that he did not “recall any response” to the letter id at  in july  the mcdonnell family visited williams’s vacation home for the weekend and governor mcdonnell borrowed williams’s ferrari while there shortly thereafter governor mcdonnell asked dr hazel to send an aide to a meeting with williams and mrs mcdonnell to discuss research studies on anatabloc the aide later testified that she did not feel pressured by governor or mrs mcdonnell to do “anything other than have the meeting” and that williams did not ask anything of her at the meeting id at  after the meeting the aide sent williams a “polite blowoff” email id at  at a subsequent meeting at the governor’s mansion mrs mcdonnell admired williams’s rolex and mentioned that she wanted to get one for governor mcdonnell williams asked if mrs mcdonnell wanted him to purchase a rolex for the governor and mrs mcdonnell responded “yes that would be nice” id at  williams did so and mrs mcdonnell later gave the rolex to governor mcdonnell as a christmas present in august  the mcdonnells hosted a lunch event for star scientific at the governor’s mansion according to williams the purpose of the event was to launch anatabloc see id at  according to governor mcdonnell’s gubernatorial counsel however it was just lunch see id at – the guest list for the event included researchers at the university of virginia and virginia commonwealth university during the event star scientific distributed free samples of anatabloc in addition to eight  checks that researchers could use in preparing grant proposals for studying anatabloc governor mcdonnell asked researchers at the event whether they thought “there was some scientific validity” to anatabloc and “whether or not there was any reason to explore this further” id at  he also asked whether this could “be something good for the commonwealth particularly as it relates to economy or job creation” ibid when williams asked governor mcdonnell whether he would support funding for the research studies governor mcdonnell “very politely” replied “i have limited decisionmaking power in this area” id at  in january  mrs mcdonnell asked williams for an additional loan for the virginia beach rental properties and williams agreed on february  governor mcdonnell followed up on that conversation by calling williams to discuss a  loan several days later williams complained to mrs mcdonnell that the virginia universities were not returning star scientific’s calls she passed williams’s complaint on to the governor while mrs mcdonnell was driving with governor mcdonnell she also emailed governor mcdonnell’s counsel stating that the governor “wants to know why nothing has developed” with the research studies after williams had provided the eight  checks for preparing grant proposals and that the governor “wants to get this going” at the universities id at   according to governor mcdonnell however mrs mcdonnell acted without his knowledge or permission and he never made the statements she attributed to him id at – on february  governor mcdonnell emailed williams to check on the status of documents related to the  loan a few minutes later governor mcdonnell emailed his counsel stating “please see me about anatabloc issues at vcu and uva thanks” id at  governor mcdonnell’s counsel replied “will do we need to be careful with this issue” ibid the next day governor mcdonnell’s counsel called star scientific’s lobbyist in order to “change the expectations” of star scientific regarding the involvement of the governor’s office in the studies id at  at the end of february governor mcdonnell hosted a healthcare industry reception at the governor’s mansion which williams attended mrs mcdonnell also invited a number of guests recommended by williams including researchers at the virginia universities governor mcdonnell was present but did not mention star scientific williams or anatabloc during the event id at – that same day governor mcdonnell and williams spoke about the  loan and williams loaned the money to the mcdonnells shortly thereafter id at   in march  governor mcdonnell met with lisa hicksthomas the virginia secretary of administration and sara wilson the director of the virginia department of human resource management the purpose of the meeting was to discuss virginia’s health plan for state employees at that time governor mcdonnell was taking anatabloc several times a day he took a pill during the meeting and told hicksthomas and wilson that the pills “were working well for him” and “would be good for” state employees id at  hicksthomas recalled governor mcdonnell asking them to meet with a representative from star scientific wilson had no such recollection id at   after the discussion with governor mcdonnell hicksthomas and wilson looked up anatabloc on the internet but they did not set up a meeting with star scientific or conduct any other followup id at   it is undisputed that virginia’s health plan for state employees does not cover nutritional supplements such as anatabloc in may  governor mcdonnell requested an additional  loan which williams provided throughout this period williams also paid for several rounds of golf for governor mcdonnell and his children took the mcdonnells on a weekend trip and gave  as a wedding gift to one of the mcdonnells’ daughters in total williams gave the mcdonnells over  in gifts and loans b in january  governor mcdonnell was indicted for accepting payments loans gifts and other things of value from williams and star scientific in exchange for “performing official actions on an asneeded basis as opportunities arose to legitimize promote and obtain research studies for star scientific’s products” supp app  the charges against him comprised one count of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud three counts of honest services fraud one count of conspiracy to commit hobbs act extortion six counts of hobbs act extortion and two counts of making a false statement see  u s c §§  honest services fraud §a hobbs act extortion § false statement mrs mcdonnell was indicted on similar charges plus obstructing official proceedings based on her alleged involvement in the scheme see §c obstruction the theory underlying both the honest services fraud and hobbs act extortion charges was that governor mcdonnell had accepted bribes from williams see skilling v united states  u s    construing honest services fraud to forbid “fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks” evans v united states  u s     construing hobbs act extortion to include “ ‘taking a bribe’ ” the parties agreed that they would define honest services fraud with reference to the federal bribery statute  u s c § that statute makes it a crime for “a public official or person selected to be a public official directly or indirectly corruptly” to demand seek receive accept or agree “to receive or accept anything of value” in return for being “influenced in the performance of any official act” §b an “official act” is defined as “any decision or action on any question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy which may at any time be pending or which may by law be brought before any public official in such official’s official capacity or in such official’s place of trust or profit” §a the parties also agreed that obtaining a “thing of value    knowing that the thing of value was given in return for official action” was an element of hobbs act extortion and that they would use the definition of “official act” found in the federal bribery statute to define “official action” under the hobbs act  f d   ca  internal quotation marks omitted as a result of all this the government was required to prove that governor mcdonnell committed or agreed to commit an “official act” in exchange for the loans and gifts from williams see evans  u s at  “the offense is completed at the time when the public official receives a payment in return for his agreement to perform specific official acts fulfillment of the quid pro quo is not an element of the offense” the government alleged that governor mcdonnell had committed at least five “official acts”  “arranging meetings for williams with virginia government officials who were subordinates of the governor to discuss and promote anatabloc”  “hosting and    attending events at the governor’s mansion designed to encourage virginia university researchers to initiate studies of anatabine and to promote star scientific’s products to doctors for referral to their patients”  “contacting other government officials in the governor’s office as part of an effort to encourage virginia state research universities to initiate studies of anatabine”  “promoting star scientific’s products and facilitating its relationships with virginia government officials by allowing williams to invite individuals important to star scientific’s business to exclusive events at the governor’s mansion” and  “recommending that senior government officials in the governor’s office meet with star scientific executives to discuss ways that the company’s products could lower healthcare costs” supp app –indictment the case proceeded to a jury trial which lasted five weeks pursuant to an immunity agreement williams testified that he had given the gifts and loans to the mcdonnells to obtain the governor’s “help with the testing” of anatabloc at virginia’s medical schools app  governor mcdonnell acknowledged that he had requested loans and accepted gifts from williams he testified however that setting up meetings with government officials was something he did “literally thousands of times” as governor and that he did not expect his staff “to do anything other than to meet” with williams id at  several state officials testified that they had discussed anatabloc with williams or governor mcdonnell but had not taken any action to further the research studies id at – dr hazel – aide to dr hazel – sara wilson – lisa hicksthomas a uva employee in the university research office who had never spoken with the governor about anatabloc testified that she wrote a procon list concerning research studies on anatabloc the first “pro” was the “perception to governor that uva would like to work with local companies” and the first “con” was the “political pressure from governor and impact on future uva requests from the governor” id at   sharon krueger following closing arguments the district court instructed the jury that to convict governor mcdonnell it must find that he agreed “to accept a thing of value in exchange for official action” supp app  the court described the five alleged “official acts” set forth in the indictment which involved arranging meetings hosting events and contacting other government officials the court then quoted the statutory definition of “official act” and—as the government had requested—advised the jury that the term encompassed “acts that a public official customarily performs” including acts “in furtherance of longerterm goals” or “in a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end” id at – governor mcdonnell had requested the court to further instruct the jury that the “fact that an activity is a routine activity or a ‘settled practice’ of an officeholder does not alone make it an ‘official act’ ” and that “merely arranging a meeting attending an event hosting a reception or making a speech are not standing alone ‘official acts’ even if they are settled practices of the official” because they “are not decisions on matters pending before the government”  f d at  internal quotation marks omitted he also asked the court to explain to the jury that an “official act” must intend to or “in fact influence a specific official decision the government actually makes—such as awarding a contract hiring a government employee issuing a license passing a law or implementing a regulation” app to pet for cert a the district court declined to give governor mcdonnell’s proposed instruction to the jury the jury convicted governor mcdonnell on the honest services fraud and hobbs act extortion charges but acquitted him on the false statement charges mrs mcdonnell was also convicted on most of the charges against her although the government requested a sentence of at least ten years for governor mcdonnell the district court sentenced him to two years in prison mrs mcdonnell received a oneyear sentence following the verdict governor mcdonnell moved to vacate his convictions on the ground that the jury instructions “were legally erroneous because they i allowed the jury to convict him on an erroneous understanding of ‘official act’ and ii allowed a conviction on the theory that he accepted things of value that were given for future unspecified action”  f supp d   ed va  the district court denied the motion id at  in addition governor mcdonnell moved for acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to convict him and that the hobbs act and honest services statute were unconstitutionally vague crim no –cr– ed va dec   supp app  – that motion was also denied see id at – he also raised other challenges to his convictions which are not at issue here governor mcdonnell appealed his convictions to the fourth circuit challenging the definition of “official action” in the jury instructions on the ground that it deemed “virtually all of a public servant’s activities ‘official’ no matter how minor or innocuous”  f d at  he also reiterated his challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the constitutionality of the statutes under which he was convicted id at  n   the fourth circuit affirmed and we granted certiorari  u s   mrs mcdonnell’s separate appeal remains pending before the court of appeals ii the issue in this case is the proper interpretation of the term “official act” section a defines an “official act” as “any decision or action on any question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy which may at any time be pending or which may by law be brought before any public official in such official’s official capacity or in such official’s place of trust or profit” according to the government “congress used intentionally broad language” in §a to embrace “any decision or action on any question or matter that may at any time be pending or which may by law be brought before any public official in such official’s official capacity” brief for united states – government’s emphasis alteration and internal quotation marks omitted the government concludes that the term “official act” therefore encompasses nearly any activity by a public official in the government’s view “official act” specifically includes arranging a meeting contacting another public official or hosting an event—without more—concerning any subject including a broad policy issue such as virginia economic development id at – tr of oral arg – governor mcdonnell in contrast contends that statutory context compels a more circumscribed reading limiting “official acts” to those acts that “direct  a particular resolution of a specific governmental decision” or that pressure another official to do so brief for petitioner   he also claims that “vague corruption laws” such as § implicate serious constitutional concerns militating “in favor of a narrow cautious reading of these criminal statutes” id at  taking into account the text of the statute the precedent of this court and the constitutional concerns raised by governor mcdonnell we reject the government’s reading of §a and adopt a more bounded interpretation of “official act” under that interpretation setting up a meeting calling another public official or hosting an event does not standing alone qualify as an “official act” a the text of §a sets forth two requirements for an “official act” first the government must identify a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” that “may at any time be pending” or “may by law be brought” before a public official second the government must prove that the public official made a decision or took an action “on” that question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy or agreed to do so the issue here is whether arranging a meeting contacting another official or hosting an event—without more—can be a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” and if not whether it can be a decision or action on a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” the first inquiry is whether a typical meeting call or event is itself a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” the government argues that nearly any activity by a public official qualifies as a question or matter—from workaday functions such as the typical call meeting or event to the broadest issues the government confronts such as fostering economic development we conclude however that the terms “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” do not sweep so broadly the last four words in that list—“cause” “suit” “proceeding” and “controversy”—connote a formal exercise of governmental power such as a lawsuit hearing or administrative determination see eg crimes act of  § stat  using “cause” “suit” and “controversy” in a related statutory context to refer to judicial proceedings black’s law dictionary –  – th ed  defining “cause” “suit” and “controversy” as judicial proceedings  u s c §b using “proceeding” to refer to trials hearings or the like “before any court any committee of either house or both houses of congress or any agency commission or officer” although it may be difficult to define the precise reach of those terms it seems clear that a typical meeting telephone call or event arranged by a public official does not qualify as a “cause suit proceeding or controversy” but what about a “question” or “matter” a “question” could mean any “subject or aspect that is in dispute open for discussion or to be inquired into” and a “matter” any “subject” of “interest or relevance” webster’s third new international dictionary    if those meanings were adopted a typical meeting call or event would qualify as a “question” or “matter” a “question” may also be interpreted more narrowly however as “a subject or point of debate or a proposition being or to be voted on in a meeting” such as a question “before the senate” id at  similarly a “matter” may be limited to “a topic under active and usually serious or practical consideration” such as a matter that “will come before the committee” id at  to choose between those competing definitions we look to the context in which the words appear under the familiar interpretive canon noscitur a sociis “a word is known by the company it keeps” jarecki v g d searle  co  u s     while “not an inescapable rule” this canon “is often wisely applied where a word is capable of many meanings in order to avoid the giving of unintended breadth to the acts of congress” ibid for example in gustafson v alloyd co  u s    a statute defined the word “prospectus” as a “prospectus notice circular advertisement letter or communication” id at – internal quotation marks omitted we held that although the word “communication” could in the abstract mean any type of communication “it is apparent that the list refers to documents of wide dissemination” and that inclusion “of the term ‘communication’ in that list suggests that it too refers to a public communication” id at  applying that same approach here we conclude that a “question” or “matter” must be similar in nature to a “cause suit proceeding or controversy” because a typical meeting call or event arranged by a public official is not of the same stripe as a lawsuit before a court a determination before an agency or a hearing before a committee it does not qualify as a “question” or “matter” under §a that more limited reading also comports with the presumption “that statutory language is not superfluous” arlington central school dist bd of ed v murphy  u s   n    if “question” and “matter” were as unlimited in scope as the government argues the terms “cause suit proceeding or controversy” would serve no role in the statute—every “cause suit proceeding or controversy” would also be a “question” or “matter” under a more confined interpretation however “question” and “matter” may be understood to refer to a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a “cause suit proceeding or controversy” but that does not necessarily fall into one of those prescribed categories because a typical meeting call or event is not itself a question or matter the next step is to determine whether arranging a meeting contacting another official or hosting an event may qualify as a “decision or action” on a different question or matter that requires us to first establish what counts as a question or matter in this case in addition to the requirements we have described §a states that the question or matter must be “pending” or “may by law be brought” before “any public official” “pending” and “may by law be brought” suggest something that is relatively circumscribed—the kind of thing that can be put on an agenda tracked for progress and then checked off as complete in particular “may by law be brought” conveys something within the specific duties of an official’s position—the function conferred by the authority of his office the word “any” conveys that the matter may be pending either before the public official who is performing the official act or before another public official the district court however determined that the relevant matter in this case could be considered at a much higher level of generality as “virginia business and economic development” or—as it was often put to the jury—“bob’s for jobs” supp app  see eg app     economic development is not naturally described as a matter “pending” before a public official—or something that may be brought “by law” before him—any more than “justice” is pending or may be brought by law before a judge or “national security” is pending or may be brought by law before an officer of the armed forces under §a the pertinent “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” must be more focused and concrete for its part the fourth circuit found at least three questions or matters at issue in this case  “whether researchers at any of virginia’s state universities would initiate a study of anatabloc”  “whether the statecreated tobacco indemnification and community revitalization commission” would “allocate grant money for the study of anatabine” and  “whether the health insurance plan for state employees in virginia would include anatabloc as a covered drug”  f d at – we agree that those qualify as questions or matters under §a each is focused and concrete and each involves a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit administrative determination or hearing the question remains whether—as the government argues—merely setting up a meeting hosting an event or calling another official qualifies as a decision or action on any of those three questions or matters although the word “decision” and especially the word “action” could be read expansively to support the government’s view our opinion in united states v sundiamond growers of cal  u s    rejects that interpretation in sundiamond the court stated that it was not an “official act” under § for the president to host a championship sports team at the white house the secretary of education to visit a high school or the secretary of agriculture to deliver a speech to “farmers concerning various matters of usda policy” id at  we recognized that “the secretary of agriculture always has before him or in prospect matters that affect farmers just as the president always has before him or in prospect matters that affect college and professional sports and the secretary of education matters that affect high schools” ibid but we concluded that the existence of such pending matters was not enough to find that any action related to them constituted an “official act” ibid it was possible to avoid the “absurdities” of convicting individuals on corruption charges for engaging in such conduct we explained “through the definition of that term” ie by adopting a more limited definition of “official acts” id at  it is apparent from sundiamond that hosting an event meeting with other officials or speaking with interested parties is not standing alone a “decision or action” within the meaning of §a even if the event meeting or speech is related to a pending question or matter instead something more is required §a specifies that the public official must make a decision or take an action on that question or matter or agree to do so for example a decision or action to initiate a research study—or a decision or action on a qualifying step such as narrowing down the list of potential research topics—would qualify as an “official act” a public official may also make a decision or take an action on a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” by using his official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an “official act” in addition if a public official uses his official position to provide advice to another official knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an “official act” by another official that too can qualify as a decision or action for purposes of §a see united states v birdsall  u s    finding “official action” on the part of subordinates where their superiors “would necessarily rely largely upon the reports and advice of subordinates    who were more directly acquainted with” the “facts and circumstances of particular cases” under this court’s precedents a public official is not required to actually make a decision or take an action on a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” it is enough that the official agree to do so see evans  u s at  the agreement need not be explicit and the public official need not specify the means that he will use to perform his end of the bargain nor must the public official in fact intend to perform the “official act” so long as he agrees to do so a jury could for example conclude that an agreement was reached if the evidence shows that the public official received a thing of value knowing that it was given with the expectation that the official would perform an “official act” in return see ibid it is up to the jury under the facts of the case to determine whether the public official agreed to perform an “official act” at the time of the alleged quid pro quo the jury may consider a broad range of pertinent evidence including the nature of the transaction to answer that question setting up a meeting hosting an event or calling an official or agreeing to do so merely to talk about a research study or to gather additional information however does not qualify as a decision or action on the pending question of whether to initiate the study simply expressing support for the research study at a meeting event or call—or sending a subordinate to such a meeting event or call—similarly does not qualify as a decision or action on the study as long as the public official does not intend to exert pressure on another official or provide advice knowing or intending such advice to form the basis for an “official act” otherwise if every action somehow related to the research study were an “official act” the requirement that the public official make a decision or take an action on that study or agree to do so would be meaningless of course this is not to say that setting up a meeting hosting an event or making a phone call is always an innocent act or is irrelevant in cases like this one if an official sets up a meeting hosts an event or makes a phone call on a question or matter that is or could be pending before another official that could serve as evidence of an agreement to take an official act a jury could conclude for example that the official was attempting to pressure or advise another official on a pending matter and if the official agreed to exert that pressure or give that advice in exchange for a thing of value that would be illegal the government relies on this court’s decision in birdsall to support a more expansive interpretation of “official act” but birdsall is fully consistent with our reading of §a we held in birdsall that “official action” could be established by custom rather than “by statute” or “a written rule or regulation” and need not be a formal part of an official’s decisionmaking process  u s at – that does not mean however that every decision or action customarily performed by a public official—such as the myriad decisions to refer a constituent to another official—counts as an “official act” the “official action” at issue in birdsall was “advising the commissioner of indian affairs contrary to the truth” that the facts of the case warranted granting leniency to certain defendants convicted of “unlawfully selling liquor to indians” id at – that “decision or action” fits neatly within our understanding of §a it reflected a decision or action to advise another official on the pending question whether to grant leniency in sum an “official act” is a decision or action on a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” the “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” must involve a formal exercise of governmental power that is similar in nature to a lawsuit before a court a determination before an agency or a hearing before a committee it must also be something specific and focused that is “pending” or “may by law be brought” before a public official to qualify as an “official act” the public official must make a decision or take an action on that “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” or agree to do so that decision or action may include using his official position to exert pressure on another official to perform an “official act” or to advise another official knowing or intending that such advice will form the basis for an “official act” by another official setting up a meeting talking to another official or organizing an event or agreeing to do so—without more—does not fit that definition of “official act” b in addition to being inconsistent with both text and precedent the government’s expansive interpretation of “official act” would raise significant constitutional concerns section  prohibits quid pro quo corruption—the exchange of a thing of value for an “official act” in the government’s view nearly anything a public official accepts—from a campaign contribution to lunch—counts as a quid and nearly anything a public official does—from arranging a meeting to inviting a guest to an event—counts as a quo see brief for united states   tr of oral arg – – but conscientious public officials arrange meetings for constituents contact other officials on their behalf and include them in events all the time the basic compact underlying representative government assumes that public officials will hear from their constituents and act appropriately on their concerns—whether it is the union official worried about a plant closing or the homeowners who wonder why it took five days to restore power to their neighborhood after a storm the government’s position could cast a pall of potential prosecution over these relationships if the union had given a campaign contribution in the past or the homeowners invited the official to join them on their annual outing to the ballgame officials might wonder whether they could respond to even the most commonplace requests for assistance and citizens with legitimate concerns might shrink from participating in democratic discourse this concern is substantial white house counsel who worked in every administration from that of president reagan to president obama warn that the government’s “breathtaking expansion of publiccorruption law would likely chill federal officials’ interactions with the people they serve and thus damage their ability effectively to perform their duties” brief for former federal officials as amici curiae  six former virginia attorneys general—four democrats and two republicans—also filed an amicus brief in this court echoing those concerns as did  former state attorneys general from states other than virginia— democrats  republicans and  independent brief for former virginia attorneys general as amici curiae –  brief for  former state attorneys general nonvirginia as amici curiae – none of this of course is to suggest that the facts of this case typify normal political interaction between public officials and their constituents far from it but the government’s legal interpretation is not confined to cases involving extravagant gifts or large sums of money and we cannotconstrue a criminal statute on the assumption that the government will “use it responsibly” united states v stevens  u s     the court in sundiamond declined to rely on “the government’s discretion” to protect against overzealous prosecutions under § concluding instead that “a statute in this field that can linguistically be interpreted to be either a meat axe or a scalpel should reasonably be taken to be the latter”  u s at   a related concern is that under the government’s interpretation the term “official act” is not defined “with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited” or “in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement” skilling  u s at – internal quotation marks omitted under the “ ‘standardless sweep’ ” of the government’s reading kolender v lawson  u s     public officials could be subject to prosecution without fair notice for the most prosaic interactions “invoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison” for up to  years raises the serious concern that the provision “does not comport with the constitution’s guarantee of due process” johnson v united states  u s    slip op at  our more constrained interpretation of §a avoids this “vagueness shoal” skilling  u s at  the government’s position also raises significant federalism concerns a state defines itself as a sovereign through “the structure of its government and the character of those who exercise government authority” gregory v ashcroft  u s     that includes the prerogative to regulate the permissible scope of interactions between state officials and their constituents here where a more limited interpretation of “official act” is supported by both text and precedent we decline to “construe the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the federal government in setting standards” of “good government for local and state officials” mcnally v united states  u s     see also united states v enmons  u s –  rejecting a “broad concept of extortion” that would lead to “an unprecedented incursion into the criminal jurisdiction of the states” iii a governor mcdonnell argues that his convictions must be vacated because the jury was improperly instructed on the meaning of “official act” under §a of the federal bribery statute according to governor mcdonnell the district court “refused to convey any meaningful limits on ‘official act’ giving an instruction that allowed the jury to convict him for lawful conduct” brief for petitioner  we agree the jury instructions included the statutory definition of “official action” and further defined the term to include “actions that have been clearly established by settled practice as part of a public official’s position even if the action was not taken pursuant to responsibilities explicitly assigned by law” supp app – the instructions also stated that “official actions may include acts that a public official customarily performs” including acts “in furtherance of longerterm goals” or “in a series of steps to exercise influence or achieve an end” id at  in light of our interpretation of the term “official acts” those instructions lacked important qualifications rendering them significantly overinclusive first the instructions did not adequately explain to the jury how to identify the “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” as noted the fourth circuit held that “the government presented evidence of three questions or matters”  “whether researchers at any of virginia’s state universities would initiate a study of anatabloc”  “whether the statecreated tobacco indemnification and community revitalization commission” would “allocate grant money for the study of anatabine” and  “whether the health insurance plan for state employees in virginia would include anatabloc as a covered drug”  f d at – the problem with the district court’s instructions is that they provided no assurance that the jury reached its verdict after finding those questions or matters the testimony at trial described how governor mcdonnell set up meetings contacted other officials and hosted events it is possible the jury thought that a typical meeting call or event was itself a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” if so the jury could have convicted governor mcdonnell without finding that he committedor agreed to commit an “official act” as properly defined to prevent this problem the district court should have instructed the jury that it must identify a “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” involving the formal exercise of governmental power second the instructions did not inform the jury that the “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” must be more specific and focused than a broad policy objective the government told the jury in its closing argument that “whatever it was” governor mcdonnell had done “it’s all official action” app to pet for cert a–a based on that remark and the repeated references to “bob’s for jobs” at trial the jury could have thought that the relevant “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” was something as nebulous as “virginia business and economic development” as the district court itself concluded supp app – “the alleged official actions in this case were within the range of actions on questions matters or causes pending before mcdonnell as governor as multiple witnesses testified that virginia business and economic development was a top priority in mcdonnell’s administration” to avoid that misconception the district court should have instructed the jury that the pertinent “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” must be something specific and focused that is “pending” or “may by law be brought before any public official” such as the question whether to initiate the research studies third the district court did not instruct the jury that to convict governor mcdonnell it had to find that he made a decision or took an action—or agreed to do so—on the identified “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” as we have construed that requirement at trial several of governor mcdonnell’s subordinates testified that he asked them to attend a meeting not that he expected them to do anything other than that see eg app  –  if that testimony reflects what governor mcdonnell agreed to do at the time he accepted the loans and gifts from williams then he did not agree to make a decision or take an action on any of the three questions or matters described by the fourth circuit the jury may have disbelieved that testimony or found other evidence that governor mcdonnell agreed to exert pressure on those officials to initiate the research studies or add anatabloc to the state health plan but it is also possible that the jury convicted governor mcdonnell without finding that he agreed to make a decision or take an action on a properly defined “question matter cause suit proceeding or controversy” to forestall that possibility the district court should have instructed the jury that merely arranging a meeting or hosting an event to discuss a matter does not count as a decision or action on that matter because the jury was not correctly instructed on the meaning of “official act” it may have convicted governor mcdonnell for conduct that is not unlawful for that reason we cannot conclude that the errors in the jury instructions were “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt” neder v united states  u s    internal quotation marks omitted we accordingly vacate governor mcdonnell’s convictions b governor mcdonnell raises two additional claims first he argues that the charges against him must be dismissed because the honest services statute and the hobbs act are unconstitutionally vague see brief for petitioner – we reject that claim for purposes of this case the parties defined honest services fraud and hobbs act extortion with reference to § of the federal bribery statute because we have interpreted the term “official act” in §a in a way that avoids the vagueness concerns raised by governor mcdonnell we decline to invalidate those statutes under the facts here see skilling  u s at  seeking “to construe not condemn congress’ enactments” second governor mcdonnell argues that the charges must be dismissed because there is insufficient evidence that he committed an “official act” or that he agreed to do so brief for petitioner – because the parties have not had an opportunity to address that question in light of the interpretation of §a adopted by this court we leave it for the court of appeals to resolve in the first instance if the court below determines that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to convict governor mcdonnell of committing or agreeing to commit an “official act” his case may be set for a new trial if the court instead determines that the evidence is insufficient the charges against him must be dismissed we express no view on that question      there is no doubt that this case is distasteful it may be worse than that but our concern is not with tawdry tales of ferraris rolexes and ball gowns it is instead with the broader legal implications of the government’s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute a more limited interpretation of the term “official act” leaves ample room for prosecuting corruption while comporting with the
