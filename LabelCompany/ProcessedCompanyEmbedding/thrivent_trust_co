require inquiry or indepth investigation for this bank we have noted net interest marginoverheadinstitution commentaryoverview of institutionthrivent trust co which as of march   reported  million in total assets at that date loans and deposits held by the bank amounted to  thousand and  million respectively the banks march   equity base of  million produced an equityassets ratio of  as of that date composite summary bankrate believes that as of march   this bank exhibited a sound condition characterized by substantially lower than normal overall sustainable profitability a very high measure of asset quality very strong capitalization and seemingly ample liquidity earnings analysis for the twelve months ended march   the bank recorded a net loss of  thousand the bank experienced a return on average assets roa of  over the latest four quarters year earlier twelve month results amounted to a net income of  thousand or a  roa over the most recent four quarters at that time an roa of at least  is deemed satisfactory in accordance with banking industry standards and the industrys annualized roa for the twelve months of  was approximately  for commercial banks and  for thrift institutions we have concluded that for the four quarters ending march   the bank achieved substantially below average return on equity  and as noted sustained an actual loss for that period  we deem net interest margin to have been substantially below average and the reported percentage should cause inquiry into balance sheet composition asset yields and liability costs noninterest income was solid we also observed overhead ratios that were significantly higher than average and the composition of overhead should be thoroughly analyzed importantly net interest margins noninterest income components and overhead expense levels represent operating factors that combine to impact overall operating results asset quality analysis the bank revealed as previously stated a very high measure of asset quality our conclusion with respect to asset quality incorporates our analysis of data depicting regional economic conditions as well as our computations of a relatively low march   nonperforming asset ratio much better than normal reserve coverage for nonperforming loans and apparently acceptable quality or no greater than average holdings of commercial real estate and construction loans two categories that can intensify credit risk other asset categories such as farm and consumer loans which may carry more than usual default potential should not have a substantial negative impact upon future results loan yield can measure financial reward versus credit risk excessive loan yield may be an indicator of existing or future problems our loan review indicates that the bank has assumed a seemingly prudent position between credit risk and financial reward capital analysis for the one year period ended march   the bank reported an approximately normal rate of growth in equity capital balance sheet structural changes through the one year period of time ended march   have improved the banks capital position our analytical methodology does take into account the quantity quality and durability of net worth and as set forth above we have determined based upon our series of tests that the bank demonstrates very strong capitalization we have calculated the banks march   total riskbased capital position a computation used by industry regulators and have concluded that this bank substantially exceeded the requirement set by regulation for this test liquidity analysis as of march   the bank displayed much better than normal balance sheet liquidity and a no greater than average dependence upon wholesale or noncore liabilities which include all borrowings such as federal home loan bank advances and cds greater than  accounting principles require some securities to be categorized as availableforsale changes in market value of these securities are reflected through the gaap generally accepted accounting principles net worth of the institution based upon the banks present balance sheet changes in the value of the current level of securities
