company’s management the company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of december   the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching its desired disclosure control objectives based upon this evaluation management concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december   for the same reason that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective          management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   the company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined by the securities and exchange commission internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and implemented by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   the company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission or the coso framework management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of the company’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls   based on this assessment management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   since the company did not have sufficient accounting personnel to support standalone external financial reporting under public company or requirements of the securities and exchange commission  specifically the company did not effectively segregate certain accounting duties due to the small size of its accounting staff not did it maintain a sufficient number of adequately trained personnel necessary to anticipate and identify risks critical to financial reporting and the closing process   a recognized material weakness would be a significant deficiency within the meaning of public company accounting oversight board auditing standard no  or combination of significant deficiencies that would result in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their assigned functions    this annual report on form k does not include an attestation report by the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting management’s report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the sec that require the company to provide only the

going concern   the company’s financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern t he company also has a working capital deficit as of december   these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the company’s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond  additionally the company’s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the company’s researching for new markets the company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from financing activities more specifically from related party loans   while the company strongly believes that its capital resources will be sufficient in the near term there is no assurance that the company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital or if additional capital is needed that such funds if available will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the company   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates   cash and cash
