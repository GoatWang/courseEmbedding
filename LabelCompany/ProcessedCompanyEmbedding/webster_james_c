stranger kids strangerkidscom available at httpwwwstrangercomicscomiammixed     i am mixed   this could be the perfect book for kids of any age it could also be the perfect book for adults of any age i am mixed tells the story of twins jay and nia but it’s so much more than the story of two multiracial kids i have to first say that the illustrations by james c webster are amazing it’s so refreshing to see a picture book with great pictures but it’s not just a picture book it’s much more preschoolers will love listening to the adults in their lives read the story and they can look for the fanciful “hidden” animals on each page i have noticed that most books about or for multiracial children become trite and preachy about how biracial kids are the best of both worlds not this one it shows things light and dark and the beauty in both it also deals with some common things our kids get asked like hair texture and does it in such a way that presents it casually and naturally four of my favorite pages read like this i am a cuban painter with brush in hand i am a haitian farmer healing the land i am a chinese dragon in search of mars i am a mexican sailor who travels afar the authors delve into different cultures with ease and grace there is even a bonus family tree in the back of the book and an “about me” page that can both be filled in and individualized fabulous additions yes this absolutely delightful book has everything although i would have preferred the terminology of “multiracial” rather than “mixed” it does not take a thing away from the need for this book to be in every home and library review by susan graham of project race           category blog · tags childrens books garcelle beauvais i am mixed james c webster mixed race multiracial sebastian
