value for money likelihood to recommend not likely extremely likely pros ease of implementation flexible whole data set search approach open ended architecture that enables search and analytics filters for every data set we have numetric quickly enables whatif iterations and speed to decision time that facilitates agile management approaches cons typical new software development issues where features and functionality are evolving given the core efficiencies we have gained in a very short time in using numetric it is easy to become impatient for more ground breaking features to date numetric has followed a logical path in how their functionality has evolved we trust their development path going forward overall numetric represents an important new threshold in data visualization and meaningful analytics it represents a transition similar to the days of standalone word processors with proprietary software and specialized operators to leaping to microsoft word in windows the end data user can now readily manage their own data compared to current tech heavy specialists necessary for even getting tableau to work well sequel search is well on its out thanks to the whole data set approach of numetric numetric requires far fewer tech intermediaries to gain live data analytics numetrics is a game changer for rank and file decision makers as well as top level executives perhaps the most important factor that numetic brings to us is its ability to access live data from numerous data sets in disparate software sources and otherwise enable us to have a real time virtual enterprise system that avoids the inflexibility and expense of typical erp systems numetric has allowed us to see our business very easily and quickly with minimal disruption and planning it has enabled us to iterate our way through our true operational review of how our business truly operates we can easily see all the incongruencies in operations that a team of traditional management consultants would have spent several months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to decipher numetric provides phenomenal iterative power for quickly establishing baseline operations knowledge and then enabling us to pursue the visualized issues that numetric makes readily apparent clear timely and easy data analytics iterations via numetric make strategic planning problem solving efficiency reviews and overall operational assessments far more intuitive and compelling numetic gives the executive end user far more power to utilize their own inate knowledge of business operations than any business analyst or tech intermediary can typically provide in their limited knowledge of the true workings of their respective enterprises we are executives that can now move through our own enterprise analytics far easier than through the lenses of the many intermediaries needed for tableau or other sequel search platforms recommendations to other buyers based on all the functionality limitations and deployment issues surrounding other data visualization tools we have either used or investigated numetic tempts us to think like we did when we found lotus  years ago to steal information power away from the mainframe technology lords can¿t go back to domo mar   dennis madderra president simpletech solutions inc computer networking  employees used the software for less than

years ago overall tried numetric and loved how fast it gives me what i want it still lets you share data well like domo but now the non techsavvy guys in my office can use numetric i share access with them and they have no problem clicking through and finding information seriously super amazing fast feb   john rowa yalla  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money comments i hate waiting and business intelligence tools usually require a lot of waiting it¿s frustrating to have to wait for reports to run especially when they end up leading to more questions and more reports we tried numetric at our office and i don¿t think we can go back it¿s so much easier to sit down in the conference room bring up our dashboard and get what we need i don¿t run nearly as many reports anymore and we can actually spend our time working instead makes everyones life easier feb   greg trimble lemonade stand  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money comments from what ive seen of numetric the software is amazing and the people behind it are just as amazing its really unlike any other bi platform on the market
