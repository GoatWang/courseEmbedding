earnest products personal loans lowcost loans for qualified borrowers up to  fixed rates from  apr with autopay refinance student loans clients who consolidate  refi save  on average variable rates start at  apr with autopay parent plus refinancing personalized payment plans for extra savings variable rates start at  apr with autopay disclaimers the average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation these calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time that clients make all payments ontime and that no loans will be prepaid here’s what our math includes projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance apr and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loans both fixed and variable rate loans and here’s what our math excludes and why savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than  why this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher for any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than  years we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than  years to pay off infull why  years is the maximum term allowed for a federal student loan or the cap on any federal student loan under income based repayment savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time why this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount interest rate or both all refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan why some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances while we encourage clients to take advantage of earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data explanation of rates “with autopay” rates shown include  apr reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment use of autopay is not required to receive an earnest loan explanation of precision pricing™ savings savings calculations are based on refinancing  in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of  fixed apr with  years  months remaining on the loan term the other lender’s savings and apr light green line represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed aprs the earnest savings and apr white line represent refinancing those loans at earnest’s best fixed aprs savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new earnest and “other lender” loans the calculation assumes ontime loan payments no change in interest rates and no prepayment of loans client testimonials individuals portrayed as earnest clients on this site are actual clients and were compensated for their
