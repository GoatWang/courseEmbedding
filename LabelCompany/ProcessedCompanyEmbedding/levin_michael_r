and more challenges all at once desperate while seeking for help i made errors due to lack of information and no experiences when i called the lawyers office to set up an appointment i had the blessing of talking to tanya first it was amazing that there was no judgment towards me showing excellent listening skills even with my accent she was very professional caring and at the same time polite she made me feel like if she knew me forever when i met with her and jeff the lawyer all i was doing is trying to get some information and see if there was a way to correct the errors i made due ignorance and to learn what kind of consequences i was about to face they took my case they have taken care of me step by step in an amazing and wonderful way a lot of professionals are hungry for money and want money but there are only a few who truly care for their client to tell you the truth it is not truly about me but the well being of my children in the process of everything i’ve been facing jeff tanya and the staff have been honest professional and caring they don’t say it but they show it this is great i recommend for you to give yourself an opportunity to meet them and trust that they will do what is the right and best for you and your family no i am not being paid by anyone to say these words which are even better a lot of businesses pay to get great feedback but they don’tsaying thank you is not enough but showing appreciation in every way possible is what i am trying to do by sharing my experience with you not only that but i am telling you that you will be in great hands if you allow them to help you through this processlaw offices of dan newlincarolee k ratedmr anderson helped me with my casei had the opportunity to be a client of george dutch anderson  of the dan newlin law office i was in a auto accident and he personally kept me updated on every aspect of my case he never let me feel alone in the process he even kept my file in his office so he could update it when neededwhen my husband first contacted him he was confident that mr anderson would give my case all the time it took to follow me and my medical issues after the accident i returned to my home state of new york even though my accident happen in orlando while i was there on business mr anderson made arrangements for me to been seen by doctors in my local area on long island i was hospitalized a few times in ny and under specialized care  mr anderson followed up with my doctors in ny to make sure all my medical needs were cared forwe moved to florida shortly after the accident mranderson provided me with doctors to look after my medical care he made sure that my social security disability was filed and acceptedwhen i had a question mr anderson he would have the answers i needed i never had the need of an attorney before and being disabled because of a car accident made it a scary experience he treated me in a kind and professional mannermy son was also in the accident and he was represented by mr anderson as well since my son was a resident of florida mr anderson made sure all my sons medical needs were cared for the accident was not my sons fault as we were hit by an airport rent a car van that come over to our lanejust the thought that my life changed in one second showed me the need to rely on an attorney mr anderson was the right choice for me and my soncarolee kaufoldlaw offices of dan newlinshaina m ratedmy review for themamazing experience from start to finish i was mostly in contact with ashlyes paralegal courtney and courtney was so sweet she was very friendly and professional she took the time to get to know me a little bit i loved the fact that when she would call me we would talk about my case but she would also throw in things like hows your new baby girl or how are you doing she wasnt intrusive at all in the least bit i really enjoyed knowing that not only was my case important to them i was also important to the firm i was always updated never left in the dark about things which i really appreciated now what really amazed me after an agreement was reached was how much work was put in to make sure i got the most money they searched for discounts and other things to bring my portion up a lot higher than it would have been they went above and beyond on that because reglardess they were getting their portion they could have left it as it was but they didnt they kept fighting for me even after the agreement was reached i really hope i never have another injury again but god forbid if i do dan newlin will always be my go to  recommendmichael t gibson pa auto justice attorneylv  ratedi was hurt on the job through no fault of my own i was hit by a car while standing by my vehicle an elderly woman backed right into me she didn’t even bother to look shortly after the accident i received a call from her insurance company then they showed up at my house even taking pictures i was scared and immediately reached out to a lawyer i researched auto accident firms online and was very impressed with what i read about the law firm of michael t gibson the personal experiences he endured with his grandmother and mother’s car accident really drew me to his firm he could relate to what i was going through and brought a real passion to the process the accident robbed me of the ability to drive a truck which was my livelihood i sustained a broken leg serious damage to my hip and acl these injuries have confined me to a wheelchair and a walker i still have several surgeries to go but throughout the entire process the law firm has been there for me every step of the way always giving me timely updates on my case and fighting for me against all odds they always went the extra mile for me particularly luz jen and syd law offices of dan newlindrew h ratedi was rearended on  went to the emergency room and laid around the house in pain for days until my dad said to hire an attorney i contacted the law offices of dan newlin by email on their website and almost immediately i received a phone call from attorney ryan rhyce then things changed for me first the law firm knows the best places to go for treatment second i could focus on getting better while attorney rhyce negotiated with the insurance company trust me negotiating with insurance companies is extremely difficult for those of you who have been in a car accident and are looking on the internet trying to decide whether to hire an attorney call attorney ryan rhyce he is honest and you can trust him he watches his email all the time and it’s sometimes scary how fast he responds for quite a while i have suspected there are two of him you will be in good hands don’t try to evaluate whether or not you need an attorney attorney rhyce will give you an honest opinion please call him there is no need to suffer in pain on the sofamichael t gibson paashash k ratedi was involved in two car accidents backtoback i had heard very positive things about the law firm of michael t gibson and decided to give their office a call prior to the first accident i had never been in a car accident before dealing with the insurance company selecting the right doctors to go to for my injuries was all foreign to me i worked closely with jennifer throughout the process and she could not have been more sweet and caring when it came to my situation it’s hard to believe they had other clients with the amount of care and attention they gave to me any question i had was answered promptly their entire office is extremely helpful everything is done in a timely manner with my second accident there was no doubt as to who i would call that accident was more severe and jennifer did an amazing job getting me the settlement i deserved i always refer them to anyone involved in a car accident and will continue to do so aw nejame law firmleandro l ratedwe used nayef mubarak of nejame law firm in orlando for my green card

nayef to help us gay marriage is fairly new in the us and we found nayef to be very caring accepting experienced and knowledgeable therefore this is why we chose him as our lawyer attorney mubarak

ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically

you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication
