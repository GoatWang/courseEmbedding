distributed to atlas energys unitholders  of the limited liability company interests in arps general partner atlas energy group llc atlas energy group nyse atls atlas energy group became a separate publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the mgp as a result of the distribution following the distribution atlas energy group continues to manage arps operations and activities through its ownership of arps general partner interest we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee indiana and colorado we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy group february   and prior atlas energy for administrative services we intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated andor thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as � well tending routine maintenance and adjustment � reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and � preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of june   our mgp has withheld  of net production revenues for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and the first six months of  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas

partnership is a delaware limited partnership formed on april   with atlas resources llc serving as its managing general partner and operator atlas resources or mgp atlas resources is an indirect subsidiary of atlas resource partners lp arp arp  we have drilled and currently operate wells located in pennsylvania tennessee michigan indiana and colorado we have no employees and rely on our mgp for management which in turn relies on its parent company atlas energy lp atlas energy for administrative services we do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold we expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling overview the following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations our operating cash flows are generated from our wells which produce primarily natural gas but also some oil our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or thirdparty gas gathering systems our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production we pay our mgp as operator a monthly well supervision fee which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as · well tending routine maintenance and adjustment · reading meters recording production pumping maintaining appropriate books and records and · preparation of reports for us and government agencies the well supervision fees however do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment materials and brine disposal if these expenses are incurred we pay cost for thirdparty services materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our mgp or its affiliates also beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production our mgp as operator may retain  per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well as of september   our mgp had not withheld any funds for this purpose markets and competition the availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us and the price obtained depends on numerous factors beyond our control including the extent of domestic production imports of foreign natural gas and oil political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions market demand competition from other energy sources the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities our mgp is responsible for selling our production during  and  we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production while it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry results of operations the following

investor alert atlas resources series  lp last updated on may  have you suffered investment losses in atlas resources series  lp if so the white law group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a finra dispute resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment according to their website atlas resource partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors  the company often raises money for investments through reg d private placement offerings like the company did for atlas resources series  lp  these reg d private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission usually between  the trouble with alternative investment products like atlas resources series  lp is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds  an additional risk inherent to atlas resource partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities the white law group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling atlas resources series  lp broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age risk tolerance net worth financial needs and investment experience however another problem with reg d private placements is that the high sales commission brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments fortunately finra does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a finra arbitration claim to determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of atlas resources series  lp or another atlas resource partners private placement investment please contact the white law group at  for a free consultation the white law group
