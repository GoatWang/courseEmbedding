is all rounder in getting things done gtd whether you use for simple things to do list of complex project goals recurring tasks read manual to get most out of it mlo is very intuitive and looks cool i wish we could have a backup system a google user the mobile version is becoming more useful i still dont see the reasoning behind not giving those of is who paid for it the ability to create reoccurring tasks such as every  days i also am not sure why the today view doesnt show today past due tasks unless you scroll back in time to find them its pointless on its current iteration brian mason definitely the best tasks and todo list available kind of expensive though if you want the desktop and mobile version plus synchronization cost extra as well would give it a fifth star if it

xera flurry july   its a good to do list i had kind of a hard time figuring it out at first though i was hoping for a full calendar view feature as well but didnt see one i need multiple folders to manage home and other work i do theres a way to do it it seems but id like an easier way where i can just click on a folder and add tasks or lists from there if there is a way to do that id like to know i do have a hard time navigating it id like to keep it because i want to see my history on each completed tasks thats the big thing i would like to see full review jon fierstein july   this app is the secret to my success it easily allows me to keep track of my professional projects and the tasks that make up those projects while assigning an appropriate importance level to each task that makes up the project the best part is the app is actively developed and new features are being added and current features are being improved i have one negative issue although not with the software recently i wrote to the customer service dept for mlo i was writing regarding an issue critical to me and my ongoing success they read my message because i got a read receipt they did not reply after  weeks i sent it again still no response if this had happened with a company whos product was not critical to my lifesuccess i would have ceased using the software immediately on principal in this situation i am stuck i need this software i cant stop using it because there is no alternative that comes close to mlo but to have a simple request from a solid dedicated likely lifelong customer who has personally recruited  new users to mlo they purchased desktop  mobile versions that is just a slap in the face big time full review mylifeorganizednet july 0  please accept our deepest apologies for what happened weve emailed you regarding the issue alyona james alford june   simply the most capable customizable gtd task management tool available ive been using mlo for years and have found

earlier versions were a bit confusing though i loved the whole concept and tree structure of tasks and projects they keep on adding new features and seem way ahead of the competition as far as task management is concerned im looking forward to getting reacquainted with the app full review june   the best gtd app really a professional application  there is nothing else that comes close at this time syncing between platforms and devices is excellent the windows app is particularly fully featured the level of branches and customisable filtering is so needed one wonders why there arent more of these type of apps full review jamie bradshaw june   a fully featured app that is detailed enough to structure all your projects and tasks in a gtd way  and well designed enough to be useable also works nicely with the pc app for a great experience with both sounds like there are plans to keep everything updated overall a good premium option and worth the price for the full package full review

nl june   so far so good keep up the good work full review mylifeorganizednet july   we will do thanks george benson ii july   great features and easy to use full review amir rachum july   extremely configurable full review arik poznanski june   best gtd app full review mark curry june   been looking for a good task manager for literally years i tried wunderlist toodledo todoist and several others what i was really looking for was unlimited subtasks a strong outlining function dependencies notes and seamless integration across desktop tablet and phone i really needed a lightweight way to develop and manage multiple small projects mlo finally gave me all of that it allows me to be as simple or complex as i need to be its easy and intuitive to use right out of the box but has deep features its not free but its cheap for what it is its well thought out highly developed and still easy to use highly recommended if youre looking for a task manager to manage actual work full review mylifeorganizednet july   thank you for your kind words mark andrey david casson may   i absolutely love mlo i tried it for a while when i was first learning gtd but wasnt ready to take the plunge mlo is more complicated than other to do apps after maybe a year or more with todoist and having also looked around at other to do apps and apphijacks like the secret weapon by braintoniq i know beyond any shadow of a doubt that mlo is exactly what i want and frighteningly its the only app out there like it its an app for people who are truly serious about task management about getting their lives under control the level of control this app gives you is outstanding and unparalleled i am saddened that the gtd facebook page never seems to mention mlo although ive cheered for it more than once and that the gtd website itself doesnt even have a guide for it please give this exceptionally well crafted app a try you will be impressed todoist gets high ratings because college sophomores who spend more time making youtube videos about productivity than actually being productive upvote it before theyve even tried the product give it a few months and read gtd full review mylifeorganizednet may   thank you for your warm words david at such moments we gain more and more confidence in what we do alyona may   you need to spend some time learning your way around it but otherwise its a very good app for crossplatform task management full review review deleted whats new added statistics as new experimental featurewrite mylifeorganized review on google play to get access to this feature earlier
