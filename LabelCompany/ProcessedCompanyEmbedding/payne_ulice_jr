executive moved from basketball to law broke color barriers at law firm became first africanamerican baseball ceo bolstered brewers to best season in decades sources in  ulice payne jr made history when he became the first african american to head up a major league baseball franchise with his appointment to the role of ceo and president of the milwaukee brewers payne landed at number  on sports illustrated’s list of “ most influential minorities in sports” however payne is quick to dismiss his ethnicity when discussing his job he told the knight riddertribune news service that what mattered most as ceo was not skin color but “what you do” what he did was help push the brewers on their first upswing in over a decade though the team still closed out a losing season players and sports analysts agreed that the  brewers played better baseball than they had in years payne also used his background as a lawyer and business leader to revamp the entire brewers operation from marketing to ticket pricing to ballpark amenities the result has been increased attendance greater revenue and fans who for the first time in years are ready to show their faces again moved from basketball to law ulice payne jr was born in november of  in donora pennsylvania just south of pittsburgh his childhood home was less than a block away from us steel where his father ulice payne sr worked payne seemed destined for the same “when i grew up you either worked for the railroad the coal mine or the steel mill” payne told the milwaukee journal sentinel payne’s parents had other ideas though his father had just an eighth grade education and his mother mary had not gone beyond high school they encouraged payne and his younger brother to look for more out of life much of that encouragement came by example payne told the milwaukee journal sentinel “my father always said ‘i’ll die trying that’s what i’m going to do’” by the time the steel mills began to shut down in the mids payne had already escaped the blacksooted skies of donora for a crisp college campus in milwaukee wisconsin at marquette university sixfootsix payne made his mark in basketball he was a member of the school’s team when it won the national collegiate athletic association ncaa championship in  after earning his degree in  payne was picked by the detroit pistons during the  national basketball association draft he was later cut from the team “it was the first time in my life that i didn’t make the cut at a glance… born in november of  in donora pa son of mary and ulice payne sr married carmella payne children amber

wisconsin awards member marquette university’s  ncaa championship basketball team ranked  “ most influential minorities in sports” sports illustrated  addresses home —greenfield wi and that was very traumatic for me” he recalled to the on milwaukee website he bounced back by hitting the books “i wanted to defy the assumption of the black ballplayer who’s stupid” payne told the milwaukee journal sentinel “i’ve always tried to distinguish myself by doing the little extra to get ahead” that extra effort earned payne a law degree from marquette in  following law school payne clerked at a milwaukee court of appeals court for a year before joining a private firm as a securities lawyer in  payne was appointed commissioner of securities for the state of wisconsin the first african american to hold the position during this time payne began making regular transatlantic commutes to study for a master’s of law degree at the university of london in england this marked a new career trajectory for payne—international law he left the securities commission in  and went into private practice spending the next decade working worldwide “i’ve been in  countries as an international lawyer” he told the on milwaukee website in  payne was hired as chairman of the international business team at foley  lardner the largest law firm in wisconsin and the thlargest in the united states broke color barriers at law firm though it generally takes seven to eight years to become a partner at a major law firm payne reached that plateau just four years after joining foley the promotion made payne the firm’s first africanamerican managing partner “ulice was selected based on his reputation and his stature in the firm and my conviction that he was the absolute best person for the job” foley  lardner’s ceo told the milwaukee journal sentinel however he also acknowledged the significance of payne’s promotion “no person of color has ever risen to ulice’s position in this firm and we’re sensitive to that fact” according to the milwaukee sentinel journal citing  national statistics “minority attorneys account for  of partners in  major law firms nationwide” payne acknowledged this imbalance “when you’re black you always have to prove yourself” he told the milwaukee sentinel journal “but if i had worried about the numbers i wouldn’t be here” payne has worked to make it easier for other minorities to follow his footsteps donating to youth programs and speaking about law careers to africanamerican students in public schools by the time payne reached the upper echelons at foley  lardner he was already a prominent figure in milwaukee as a lawyer he had served on the boards of several bar associations as a businessman he had led various public organizations and had sat on the boards of several private corporations however it was his role as a board member of miller park stadium—current home of the milwaukee brewers—that introduced him to the business of sports “the board took a lot of body blows” payne was quoted by the knight riddertribune news service as saying of the difficult negotiations to fund the project at the time the milwaukee brewers were wallowing at the bottom of the national baseball pool with a losing streak that stretched back to  the stadium was a hard sell to a jaded public but the board succeeded in part by promising that the new stadium would bring with it a more competitive payroll and in turn better players became first africanamerican baseball ceo by the fall of  the milwaukee brewers were still on a downward spiral losing  games to cinch their tenth consecutive losing season fans were disgusted and players dejected the stadium had failed to turn around the team’s fortunes and was being underutilized outside of baseball the brewers decided to make drastic changes and began to look for a new ceo they soon turned to payne though he had no background in baseball his skill as a lawyer board member and college athlete made him a natural choice community leaders agreed “he’s very perceptive and he has a sports background i think he will do a great job” judge terence evans payne’s former employer at the court of appeals told the knight riddertribune news service “whatever he attempts is with the intent of succeeding” wisconsin state representative mickey lehman said in the same article “he puts his reputation on the line and i believe he has made a commitment to make the franchise a winner on the field and financially” payne’s appointment also met with approval among lobbyists pushing for more minority representation in the office suites of major league sports “clearly this is very significant” richard lapchick head of the center for the study of sport in society told the knight riddertribune news service “anytime there is a first of this magnitude an africanamerican as president of a team it’s critically important” payne was succinct in his public responses to this milestone “i’ve been in this situation before” he told the knight riddertribune news service referring to his “firsts” at the securities commission and foley  lardner “i’ve found that if i emphasize my ethnicity it would take away from who i was… i don’t believe i was chosen for that” he was not payne was chosen to take on what the wisconsin state journal called the “herculean—some would say hopeless—task of bringing the brewers back to life” payne brought to the post both an honest assessment of the team’s status and a willingness to change it “i’m not going to kid you how deep a hole we’re in” he told the capital times “i don’t like saying it it won’t help me sell tickets ok but for me to have any credibility with the market i’ve got to admit where i am” he continued in the same article “there’s a philosophy i brought to the table i call it ‘manage by fact’ we manage by fact not by forecast not by hope what others say what others expect” the facts were clear a losing record dwindling revenue and an unclear focus for the future payne tackled these problems like a big business ceo negotiating a new labor agreement implementing a lucrative new revenue sharing plan and aggressively marketing miller park to nonbaseball events from rock concerts to school sports he also completely overhauled the coaching staff releasing all but one coach and hiring a new manager ned yost a year veteran of the successful atlanta braves payne also created the team’s first mission statement according to the capital times it says in part that the brewers are “committed to fielding a competitive team both on and off the field that exemplifies a strong work ethic respect for the game and loyalty to our fans” payne began reaching out to fans with some dramatic moves including releasing several players “we made a … ‘contract with our fans’” payne told the on milwaukee website “we can’t necessarily win every game but we can try to win every game we found by listening to our fans what they were most disappointed with was that the players didn’t care … they would give up if they were down  in the second inning the first thing we said was we are going to be one of the hardest working teams in the central division and anybody who wasn’t playing hard wasn’t going to play” payne has also implemented programs designed to attract new fans he told the capital times “i might develop a player but more importantly i’m going to develop a fan” he created youth baseball programs and allowed kids to run the bases after day games a “women on wednesday” promotion was designed to attract more female fans and included perks such as free massages and food demonstrations bolstered brewers to best season in decades however all the fan initiatives in the world would not work if the brewers continued to lose “people follow their sports franchise because they live vicariously through these athletes who want to win” payne told the on milwaukee website payne made it his mission to make the players want to win he all but forbade any pessimism on the part of the players and coaches with a monumental leap of faith payne told the knight riddertribune news service “our job is to win the central division i’m not saying i would be upset if we don’t win but how can you win it if you don’t plan to” it was a simple enough philosophy but it brought about major changes though the team once again came in last in their division they had improved remarkably over the previous year they went from  wins in  to  in  they also enjoyed a tengame winning streak midaugust players and coaches alike contributed the upswing to the team’s new attitude of the new team veteran player geoff jenkins said to the mlb website “it’s a lot different” bill castro the only coach retained by the payne administration added “nobody yells and screams there is just more communication” along with rekindling the interest of the fans and reinvigorating the attitude of the players payne has also put renewed focus on the team’s a and aa leagues—the minor league teams whose players could eventually move up to the brewers “we had eight all stars selected from our aa team” payne told the on milwaukee website “we see real players in the system our goal is to bring them along slowly and  should be the time when four or five of those young men should be on the ball club” other new talent will come to the team during  when payne plans on aggressively recruiting new players using  million the team earned from payne’s new revenue sharing plan all of these moves are sure to bolster the brewers’s major league standings “we’ve got our attitude right we’ve got our focus and our work ethic” yost told the mlb website “we’ve got the right coaches in place to work hard… expectations are going to rise next year for us” “i want to win the world series my mission is to win here” payne told the on milwaukee website with typical optimism “i believe it it will come i think we’re perfectly situated with the new ball park the new labor agreement and a chance for the ball club in the minds of the public” things however went sour between payne and the brewers organization on november   payne told the milwaukee journal sentinel that most of his plans for rebuilding the team had been destroyed by other executive members of the organization who had voted to slash the  payroll while many in the brewers organization claimed that payne had signed the budget himself payne continued to hold that he was being kept out of the loop and undercut by november   payne had agreed to allow his four year contract to be bought out for  million as he told a milwaukee television news program later quoted on espn ’s website “i wish the team the best and the fans the best as i leave no hard feelings” sources periodicals capital times madison wi july   knight riddertribune news service september   february   milwaukee journal sentinel may   p  wisconsin state journal madison
