to focus on all my wonderful memories of you today i kept it low key no reading of the names no visits to ground zero the cemetery  which is an empty plot anyway or a nostalgic trip to regis just spent it getting my portfolio ready for promotion and tenure i am driving dad nuts and he is obsessively trying to make sense of my storage system on the computer i cant help but think of how you would have sorted me out in  minutes  you could follow my train of thought and finish my sentences i can smile when i think of you and sometimes i can close my eyes and feel your presence i know you would have enjoyed all the new technology and been the first to get the ipad and i phone i cant believe the changes in these past  years yet so much is unchanged you would so impressed by embracing of the computer and my ability to use blackboard and open lab with my students i think you are still helping me grandpa has hung on like the energizer bunny  his doctor says my patient jerry  you are

prayers to all the family we have lost touch but you are all still in our thoughts love and peace to you all patfrank and vincent catapano september    pm ed dear paul you would be  today  jan nd  od course we always celebrated your family �birthday on new years day i always said i would get to tell the story every year and i couldnt wait to tell it to your future wife but that did not happen now i tell it in writing to your on line guest book and i relive it in my head because all �woman relive the birth of �their children  thats part of their history the story of pregnancy and childbirth  i joked i couldnt complain that i carried you for  months because you came  weeks early  you were always in a hurry i began having contractions early new years eve and dr mays checked me and said i was in labor and there was no more stopping it  i should eat light and be prepared to come to the hospital i said i was going to my grandmothers and having a big fish dinner  and there was no way i going into labor on new years eve unless he could guarantee i would have the baby at  midnight  and get some gifts dr mays said he couldnt time it that way so i said see him after the eve he said i was about  cm and my mucous plug had passed so he would probably see me in a couple of hoursl but i could be stubborn and i really did not want to spend new years eve in the hospital knowing that the staff wanted to party and i wanted to eat my lobster dinnerl so i sipped some wine to slow the contractions etoh was used to stop labor in those days and you turned out just fine my water broke on new years just after midnight i was totally bummed out i had no intention of going to the hospital right after the new year and not having the first baby anyway but off we went i was  cm dilated and you should have been born in less than  hours however my body refused to cooperate as soon as i got to the hospital all contractions just stopped maybe it was the brandy alexander i had but maybe it was mind over matter i just refused to have you that night because i had insisted everyone was drinking and i was concerned something would go wrong i felt a good nights sleep would benefit everyone and i would have you in the morning however my uterus refused to start up again and needed a shot of pitocin to get going it was show time and you had to come out you were a forceps delivery thankfully there wasnt a mark on you  that was how skilled dr mays was dr mays retired after he deliver you he promised me he would wait until he delivered my baby and he did i had a difficult pregnancy and delivery if he wasnt the attending doctor i would have had a cs  the nurses were only too eager to inform me how lucky i was that dr mays had the patience to let me labor so long no one ever would ever suspect you were a preemie you were large for dates and hit all your developmental milestones on time some early you were born with your eyes wide open unusual  almost unheard of in an infant born so early you came out curious to see what life had to offer and you remained that way until   quick and curious with a smile that could light up a room i think of what you would look like today  at   would you have some gray at your temples i barely have gray hair at   my side doesnt seem to go gray until after  i know you would still be smiling and quick  i didnt slow down until after   though my students dont think of me as slow i know i would never have achieved all that i have without you in my life if you had not been born i would not have become a nurse educator and nurse practitioner i had such a bad feeling when your work mates nicknamed you rocket turned out i was right when a child is born as the delivery room nurse hands the baby to the mother she often says something about the infant  what the nurse may not know is that her causal remarks stay with new mother forever and become part of the story of that childs life the nurse�pronounced you an old soul for some reason i was a uncomfortable  i wanted to hear you were perfect etc i asked if you had hair i was told you had a full head i was happy  i had a son with hair �but i never forgot the old soul remark it was true �you were an old soul you came into this world with a flourish and �lit up my life you left in a terrible inferno and �you made an indelible mark �on the world i love you forever i like you for always as long as im living my baby youll be and i will always remember the day you were born just like i cant forget the day you were killed love your mom elaine january    pm est dear

honor i cant imagine the difficulty you face every september as the anniversary passes i just hope there is some comfort in hearing stories like these and knowing that paul is missed if you feel this

the only one out from the th floor that day you were always quick you were so fast you were even in a rush to be born coming a full  weeks early the nurses were surprised because you were born with your eyes open most preemies dont open their eyes so easily then again maybe you knew youd only have a short time to accomplish things and that is why you were always in a hurry and in many ways ahead

thoughts and prayers are with you and your family today we think of you often and miss your friendship and everlasting smile love the blasbergs thu  sep   to paul and his mother i dont understand why it took me seven years to find pauls website as i sat in my cubicle for  hours today reading every single post that someone made i was compelled in such a way that i had to post something to express the way i feel i couldnt stop crying thinking about everything he could have gone through and what his mom goes through everyday my name is kathryn and i grew up with paul in the summers in hemlock farms pa paul and i attended the same day camp for a few summers in the very early 0s we are the same age and our families live around the same areas in nyc we even have close birthdays jan   0 im sure this year he would have partied it up for his 0th i remember paul as being that friendly laid back kid who liked to laugh have fun and play pranks with his boy andy he was outspoken sympathetic and a great listener all at the age of  he loved numbers too however his fear of the water must have been big because he never went swimming even on those really hot summer days i wish i could have taught him how to swim   we hung out in the teen center steer barn and handball courts ill always remember his khaki shorts and boat shoes who wore boat shoes at the age of  i guess you could say he had his own style i also cant forget the camp sleepout in the apple orchard either ghost stories and pranks were his specialty that night my brother was the first to tell me about paul that day i worked in maspeth at the time over near the liebqe intersection and i had a great view of the city from my office window i could see from the empire state building all the way downtown to the twin towers when i saw what was happening i couldnt believe my eyes when i read pauls name on the list of missing persons and saw his picture my heart broke knowing that i possibly lost a childhood friend at such a young age but why would god take away such a great person thats just not fair at this time i would like to send my thoughts and my prayers to your entire family especially your mom i know she loves and misses you very very much just by reading all the words she has written i think about you often and hope your mom continues to be the strong woman that she is much love and god bless kathryn preusser katpreusseryahoocom queens ny thu  sep   thinking of you both today and wanted to let you know pauls spirit and memory are still alive in texas i pray with each passing day and year

year marks  years since the attacks on the wtc and the american way of life has been changed the world seems to be in a cycle of destruction natural disasters have killed thousands the tsunami and most recently a hurricane destroyed new orleans joanne  i went there in june with cheryl tracy and the kids to the safety engineers conference a scholarship was established in harrys name i enjoyed being with the kids but we never should have had to go there in the first place harry should have been alive and so should you and almost 0 others but we saw the big easy and the french quarter i can only hope they will rebuild this damage could have been prevented but enough money wasnt allocated to repair the levees so thousands perished and a historic city will be changed forever nyc is also changed forever but this was not natural however it could have been prevented again money was the issue the airlines still havent spent enough on proper security the government created the victims compensation fund to keep the airlines from going bankrupt from lawsuits they were supposed to correct their security problems but again money and profit motives have prevented them from doing all they should do  the fund was a horrible way to deal with our pain and loss even feinberg the special master said it should have never been done that way  i will honor you harry and all those killed on  i hate that this war was started in  victims names other mothers are losing sons and daughters they too will carry that pain like a stone in their hearts forever i cry for them for all the young people deprived of a life i am sick over the loss of lives from katrina when will we learn why why i said i wouldnt get myself caught up in asking why it wouldnt bring you back but i still do it why

too cool to listen to mainstream radio asked who the band was and instead of answering you just busted out with this great imitation of the whiny opening line of their one and only hit single its no surprise to me i am my own worst enemy  cause every now and then i kick the living s out of me and the person wish i could remember who had no idea why those words came out of your mouth and was so confused we all laughed it was a really cute moment thinking about it the other day made me happy and made me remember why i loved being friends with you so anyway just wanted to post here that i

went to regis holland my husband told me there were tons of battaglias and that he was certain it wasnt him i went online and the face that i had in my mind was the same one i saw on the computer screen there was a link to pauls website which i clicked on i began to read a blurb which was directly under his picture as i scrolled down i saw the name brian lennon a mutual friend of ours and i started to cry its been two years and i still cant believe this has happened i work by the st francis church and lit a candle for paul i cant say i couldve called him a close friend but i definitely knew him well enough to say hi whenever i saw him outside regis i actually think he came to my house for the after party for regiss production of guys and dolls its such a haunting feelingi cant even

for my house and dont know what to buy i keep saying to myself i wish paul were here to help me know what i should get sounds kinda silly but i trusted pauls computer knowledge  he always knew where to go to get things at the best price although i enjoyed working with paul at marsh i sometimes wish he would have taken the other job instead of coming back to marsh i would rather him far away than not here at all if i wrote all i want to say i would probably go on forever but sometimes it is so hard to sit down and write it takes you back to a place and thoughts that are too painful to bear i talked about paul to some of my former marsh colleagues and they visited his site it made them cry ill admit i get teary eyed too when i read all the loving memories and tributes on his site paul was one of the most incredible people i have ever met and i will never forget him finally i want to say that even though you may not hear from people or his site may not be visited regularly  dont think for one minute that he is not in alot of our daily thoughts sometimes we just dont take the time to let you know im glad i did today tonya drayton tonyadraytondbcom new york  wed sep 0 0  pm i found

everyone i cant cry too much i dont want to worry grandpa frighten eric or push kristen  dad away i am supposed to upbeat around others and refrain from making then uncomfortable about my loss and pain there are some who even feel i should say i have two children when asked so as not to make people feel sorry for me i am supposed to deny the life of my first born for the sake of some strangers delicate feelings then the whole public memorial mess they just dont get it it is about terrorism stupid the fact that innocent americans were attacked at their place of business on american soil in a holy war we didnt even know we were fighting there must be only one memorial but the cops and firemens lives seem to count more than yours or harrys or any other poor soul just going about their daily

mom brooklyn ny  wed jun  0  pm dear paul it has been a long time it was hard to write man seems appropriate to do it now on memorial day i didnt write sooner it was a rough st year after being down at the trade center on the th ironically my military unit was activated and we landed in afghanistan on the one year anniversary we barely knew of each other at binghamton before i left and went to oswego sandra remembers you and your jokes she laughed when she told me about them i want you to know a couple of thingswe tried so hard at the world trade center to find you and the others we just wanted to be superman and move all those giant steel beams but we couldnt we honestly thought the little buckets were a tiny ripple of hope and out of that would come at least one person alive we never gave up hope until that sundayand that was it i didnt find out about you until i returned home i know it bothers many today but we did the best we could and we are sorry that this happened to you all you did was go to work and live the american dream the second thing is that while we were there in afghanistan vengeance was not our goal but justice we want to make sure that what happened to you doesnt happen to anyone else or their parents family and loved ones the year after september  i tried to figure out why this happened but its not my job to figure it out it was evil pure evil the only consolation is that there is judgement in the end on these things for we all die but i think its how we treat each other down here when in afghanistan when i felt down at times i remembered you and the rest of the victims and you kept me going thank you paul thank you for living life thank you for giving a face to remember i spoke to your mother online recently she is a very strong lady and her strength is in you paul you continue to make a difference today and you are not forgotten by myself and certainly those who knew you better than i it was worth it to be away from my family

constantly this week several things have reminded me of you your smell  a student of mine male wears your cologne and i saw a movie in which the mother and son recite the words from i love you forever etc i also needed to talk to you see your smile  get a big hug this past week both the state and the national league of nursing paid my school a site visit we had low state board pass scores and a host of other problems the school was on warning from the state and probation by the nln if we failed to convince the visitors we had changed and improved the program we would have to close we prepared our defense in the form of a tedious 0 page self study and verbally i had to defend my courses and i only just got to the school in the fall they questioned me over 0 min on tuesday and again wednesday i was glad i had no idea of what i was in for prior to the visit but i kept thinking of how proud you were of me when i became an adjunct  pace and how you got such a kick out of that pen inscribed professor leinung i really felt your presence those days giving me support i also found two heads up pennies tuesday morning one right by my car and one in the bathroom they were both so shiny i was thinking they were a message from you  joey my own pennies from heaven i more than held my own during the interrogation i really believe you sent them because the nln team told us they were sent to close our program but couldnt do it after they met the faculty and the students i know i had to have had some divine intervention i wanted you there physically to hug and celebrate with me but ill have to content myself with the pennies love you forever like you for always as long as im living my baby youll be love mom elaine leinung elaineleinungverizonnet brooklyn  feb  0  pm dear paul i know as a catholic i am supposed to accept your loss as gods will but even jesus wept when he lost a loved one was it lazarus you would have known the answer even though i went to  years of catholic school the nuns were no match for the jesuits in teaching theology and of course math  science but i digress as usual i cant stick to a topic any way the beatitudes say blessed are those who mourn what in hell does that mean anyway i wish you were here so we could discuss it  to outsiders our discussion may have appeared like a fight we certainly did go at it you  i but we always got over it just as quickly as the tempers flared i am teaching nursing you would have been so proud of me i really enjoy my students passing the torch and all that youd get a kick out of it kristen enjoyed her trip to england she met some english boys im glad as you would be they are on the other side of the atlantic eric failed math he is such a pill he misses you so much i miss you and i miss not being able to send eric down to you so he could play some inappropriate and violent computer game which in his case served as an outlet for his aggression yours too i think aline keeps in touch with

have wanted to write to you for some time now the events that occured on september  were by far the darkest time our country has ever had to face like others i was drawn to the lists of missing hoping beyond hope for the families that these people would be found each image each name moved me and i prayed for the families then i came across pauls name and photograph and my heart stopped i saw my a man who could be part of my family you see my name is debbie battaglia evans i called my dad to ask if paul was a relative and to the best of our knowledge he is not although he cannot be  sure and yet i felt a kinship to this man if in name only this horrible act has taken a member of my family i hurt and then i thought of his family and how they must hurt i have said many a prayer for you and thought of you often i only hope that my prayers have brought you some peace from what i have read paul lead a very active and fufilling life though that does not negate what a potential he was to the world it does ease the pain some anyway like i said i have wanted to write for some time and again offer prayers for peace and love i very much believe that our loved ones are still a part of our lives and that their love lives on in us sincerely debbie evans evansdebbiehotmailcom  thu  dec    pst guestbook my name is mike and i never met paul but have been drawn to his site almost daily for

when the class fund raising chairs from those years whose classmates contributed over a certain amt of money to regis stood i nearly broke down one of your goals was to have your year make the order of the owl each  every year i have no doubt that you would have achieved that goal had you lived the fund raising chairman from the class of  stood he probably contributed it all himself i dont think that class can have many living members i wish you would have gotten the 0 year plan like that gentleman you should have you didnt drink smoke do drug or drive too fast  you were such a straight arrow kind of guy but not in a wimpy way of course the evening ended with the singing of the regis song again i shed some tears but i went and stood up when they called your name all the while wishing you could have been there i just want to scream you had so much to offer i spoke with the families of the other two regians who were killed gregtrost class of   matt leonard class of 0 both special young

quick note to say that i very much appreciate pauls website and the guestbook in which you and others have been able to share so much regarding pauls too short life you may recall that i taught at regisfrom  and taught paul in his senior year i left nyc in july  and returned to my childhood home in washington state for the past four years i have lived in tacoma which is about 0 miles south of seattle on wednesday i will return to teaching math at a local community college i recently visited nyc sep  and caught up with some old friends at regis and fordham u i felt that i needed to be in nyc for the first  anniversary having lived in nyc for  years and having taught paul and greg trost i was in shock around this time last year it has taken some time for the sadness to be more deeply felt i think my visit and this message to you will help me further that process i hope this message finds you and your loved ones in good health and with daily support from each other thanks again peace vince vbanderjunocom ps i recently dropped in the mail a check for pauls memorial fund which you should receive in the coming week  sun  sep   to the battaglia and leinung families so many times this past year i have gone into the website and cried when i would tell my mom who would be paul great great aunt she would cry with me and say why did god take such a vibrant young man why didnt he take me i am an old lady i guess god needed paul in heaven for a special reason and none of us will ever understand the whys i only know that  has left all of us very different and i hope and pray that the caring and concern we have for each other as human beings will remain with us and that 0 or  years down the line there will not be big 0 sales that we will and that our children will and that their children will always remember this day with reverence and that all offsprings from the battaglias and leinungs will always keep paul in their heart and remember him to be the wonderful son

screen just as they hit the last note of the song you couldnt have done it any better i just started work at a radio station with studios in the citys municipal building on centre st five blocks from

of my life although i only really knew paul well for a few months back in  hes someone who i considered a true friend and someone who has helped make me who i am today and i know im definitely not the only person who feels that way he always spoke of you and his whole family so warmly i must admit i was envious of the relationship you and he had in fact i was envious of a lot of things about paul i regret the way our friendship turned out in the past few years but i think paul always knew how much i cared for and admired him i know today must have been tough for you but please take some comfort in knowing that around the world there are thousands of people thinking about paul today  smiling about something he said telling a story about something he did listening to a memorable radio show or just looking at a picture and yes hes smiling in the picture paul died a hero and his memory and legacy is something no one will ever be able to take from him as always if theres anything i can do to

day yesterday i know weve only communicated once in an email but something about your family has made me feel close to you i feel like i knew paul perhaps it is his website and all of the similarities

the pain you are going through is unimaginable please be strong a mother is the backbone of every family and i can feel you are a strong person take care of yourself i truly believe paul is watching from above and i believe he is still around you guys it sounds crazy but i believe you never lose the people you are close to i lost my bestfriend of  years  years ago and the signs and dreams i have seen and had are phenomenal if someone would have asked me  years ago if i believed in that i would have thought they were crazy but not anymore i believe that is gods way of letting us know that our loved ones are ok its strange but i tell amy my bestfriend to watch out for paul and i swear to you i feel both of their presence i bet amy and paul are having a deep discussion right now about politics or wall street i hope so i know you dont know me but i am here for you if you ever need anything i hope it did not offend you for me to write or cause you any more pain thats the last thing i wanted to do for some reason as i stated before i feel a connection with paul and you guys feel free to write me back if you need to take care of yourself and your family love always jocelyn boddie

your family to pennsylvania for a weekend man did we have fun that weekend i also remember you coming to my house for my birthday and you and my family going out to dinner and then you spending the night at my house for a little birthday celebration i also remember being at your house on east th street as kid just hanging out inside or riding our bikes outside i will never forget the time we had just finished riding bikes we went to the yard to put our bikes away and you went into the garage and came out with car wax and you said i have a great idea lets wax our bicycles it will make them shine like a nice new car i wish there was a way to go back to those days when we were young and didnt have the responsibility of getting up everyday and working  to  instead now everyday i get on the q train at sheepshead bay road occasionally running into john and as i ride over the manhattan bridge the first thing that pops into my thoughts is you i begin to think why couldnt paul have overslept that morning and been late for work then you would still be here with us and we would have been able to become reacquainted just recently i was cleaning up some old things i had in my closet and i was getting rid of most of it when i came across a bunch of papers together and when i pulled it out the papers said autographs  we had been in st marks at the time and when i looked at the autograph that was on top it read dear john have a terrible summer hope you fail everything hope you know i am just kidding from paul that day i burst out first into laughter and then into tears thinking that paul

binghamton university student i do remember meeting him once in whrw where i was an apprentence for one of the heritage djs during my junior year in the fall of  whenever i saw paul either around the station or around campus he was always smiling and that is one thing about paul that myself and many other people will never forget i have known about pauls passing since my big sister who was a friend of pauls told me but sadly i never said anything on this webpage celebrating the life of a person who was always smiling and kind i do want to say that eventhough i have not said anything since now i have been praying for paul and all his loved ones in this past year i can say that only meeting paul once was enough for me to remember him forever so much so that i have a mercy band with his name on it with all of this said i want to wish the very best to pauls family and friends i know that he is still wish us smiling like always yours marianne stephan msangelfishaolcom brooklyn new york

did james  james keane   tue sep 0  00 pm useastern i started coming to pauls site after reading about him last november in new york times portraits of grief after reading pauls portrait i was immediately drawn to him i think that the sentence in the portrait where pauls mother discussed how paul was balancing a checkbook at age four and how he was like an adult trapped inside a childs bottom the reason that i was so intrigued was because my mom always tells me that as a child i was a 0 year old trapped in a  year olds body it seems that paul used the word hence a lot on his website which is a word that i say frequently but for most people that word is absent from their daily vocabulary after reading everything on pauls current and old site i realized what a great man he was smart funny caring among other things i have tried numerous times since last year to post but every time i go to write something i find myself at a loss of words i just wanted to let pauls family and friends that i keep you and paul in my prayers as well as all affected by that horrific event which somehow or another changed us all september th changed me for the better it made me realize the value and importance of everything that i have from friends to my car it also helped me see the aesthetic beauty in all things especially those in nature i would like to say that this post is therapeutic for me on all different levels i think that by coming to pauls site people learn about him and therefore a part of paul lives in each of his readers most of which never had the chance to meet him god bless shannan mahovlic shannanbmahovlicbankonecom  tue sep 0  00 pm useastern no love no friendship can cross the path of our destiny without leaving some mark on it forever francois

badnetvisionnetil  tue 0 sep  0 what a difference a year makes as we approach another september th im sure everyone cannot help but reflect about what has happened to us our country and the world that day for me this past year involved a lot of reflection on how i interact with people and how i express myself because whenever i thought about what happened that day i thought of paul  one of the most happy nicest general managers i ever worked with at whrw people who have asked me for my reflections on what happened that day i would tell them about paul and give them his website i would share what memories i had of him what a nice guy he was what a big smile he had how dedicated and full of life he was then i would always start to get a bit mistyeyed because what happened to paul should never have happened at all not to someone as nice as paul  not to anyone in this world if its this hard for me i can only imagine how hard it has been for those who knew him closely loved him dearly and were privileged enough to become a close friend of his pauls physical presence may no longer be with us but its nice to know that his spirit lives on with everyone he came in contact with i know that it does in me  i always try to go through my day smiling just as paul would have done on the anniversary of september th i will proudly wear my blue and khakijust for him peace love moeand paul

approaches i keep thinking of you and wishing there was a way to lighten the load of your grief perhaps the only way i can help is to tell you that i would if i could maybe it helps to know that

his story on the new york newsday website and their remembering the lost section the first thing i noticed about him was his smile in all those photos on his website he was i am certain a wonderful person and a great friend of course i dont have to tell you that i know he was someone i would like to have called friend i graduated from the university of texas in may  my graduation trip in june  took me to new york city for about 0 days i had so much fun while there i was able to visit the world trade center who knew at the time that the memories of that visit would become a part of my life forever in a way unimaginable it goes without saying that on september th i was horrified at the destruction immediately my thoughts went to the victims and their families i was so moved emotionally by all the people holding flyers with pictures of their missing loved ones i still cry when i think about it all looking at pauls picture makes me wonder if maybe just maybe we might have said hello to each other just by chance on the day of my visit to be sure i think about all the people i saw on that day of my visit to the wtc how many survived and how many perished i know that of all the individuals working at the windows on the world restaurant no one survived i remember some of their faces all the victims at the wtc including paul were just going about their daily lives professionals and kitchen staff at the windows restaurant alike its just not fair from what i read paul was the type of friend i would like to have had you have my deepest condolences i am so sorry

sincerest and deepest sympathies to pauls family and friends they have been with you since september but until now i have not been able to put them into words i knew your wonderful son brother and friend for only a short time while i attended binghamton he was in several of my business and finance courses and although we were never close were always cordial to one another paul was one of the brightest students i encountered at binghamton and i always admired and perhaps envied a little his ambition and drive he was always so full of animation and his smile lit up even the darkest of rooms but then again if you knew him im not telling you anything you dont already knowhe was a beautiful kind hearted soul and i pray that his family and friends are comforted by the fact that he was so well loved and regarded by so many wendy wmarronstanleymarksllpcom  tue may   00 pm useastern i first visited pauls site shortly after reading about him on the ny times i was drawn to his huge contagious smile and his age since i am  as well i read through most of the entries and couldnt help but cry even though i had never met him i wanted to write but never knew what to say i keep finding myself back at his page and still dont know what to saybut ill try i obviously cant even begin to imagine the the feelings that all of his friends and family are living with every day  of anger sadness grief and everything else that goes along with losing such an amazing personits obvious he was thatso many things to so many people in this world yes it has been months since  and yes it gets easier every day but i know that it never completely goes away and im so sorry for all of you for that its strange the way i never met him yet still felt drawn to him we were at similar points in our lives  recently graduated working new exciting jobs planning trips with the loves of our lives still living with our parents and loving them and respecting them but itching for some independencejust to name a few things and with all that in mind i just cant imagine being whisked away so suddenly with no chance to say goodbye i was drawn to aline as well not knowing her but just feeling drawn to her  i cant comprehend the grief she must feel over the loss of what she thought was her future i am not excluding pauls family because i know its just as difficult and even more difficult is many waysits a different kind of love that involves history and family but i can relate to alinei can see and feel everyones pain on all its levels  from his family to his friendships and beyond from the bottom of my heart i want to tell you all that im sorry sorry just doesnt seem to cut it but its all that i can say i only hope that someday i will be as remembered and as cherished as paul certainly was is and always will be jessica c regan jreganecewpiedu  thu  may  0 am i have visited pauls site many times in the past and i was particularly drawn to it today especially after reading the article in the ny times once again i have been brought to tears by you and your familys pain i was saddened that your children have had to encounter unfeeling teachers who have forgotten the tremendous loss your children have experienced it is too bad that the teacher did not have the sensitivity to accept kristens love for her brother and not insist that she list paul as her half brother on the family tree i know some teachers may find it difficult to deal with childrens pain but they must acknowledge their lack of experience or lack of comfort dealing with their students grief the board of ed needs to help these teachers recognize that everyone handles loss differently especially children what these teachers say will impact upon their students forever and ultimately help these children toward healing i do realize as a pediatric nurse practitioner i have had more experience and i am perhaps more sensitive to others needs but i feel we must never forget what happened to all of you i will never forget that day and what i saw when i was in ground zero i will never forget my friends and patients who have lost loved ones on sept th i will always grieve your loss and pray for all who have been affected lucille corva lcorvaworldnetattnet   tue  may   pm im currently watching bates battaglia help the carolina hurricanes as they are minutes away from dispatching the montreal

since right after september th but i come to the sight often to read what everyone else is writing i guess i had a belated reaction to everything because i wasnt able to really talk to anyone for a few months and the smallest things would make me cry so many tiny things remind me of you silly things you would laugh at theres a commercial for next day blinds i see it almost every morning and the guy in it makes that funny face you always made with your eyes wide open and eyebrows arched and your mouth as an o and all of this political and economic stuff has happened as a result of september th and i really want to talk to you about it and have you explain enron to me and all kinds of things its very hard to be living away from new york people in dc care much more about the political impact and forget that people lost loved ones and are grieving and they dont talk about it as much in general everyone talks about the war but the war and your death are so disconnected in my head i am still not really processing everything i happened to be in new york for work on the sixmonth anniversary and i went to ground zero at first i was fine it just looked like a construction sight then i saw the list of names and i lost it i had a picture of the two of us with me were in the kitchen at orton it was the night we all threw the wine and cheese party i left the picture there to aline and the leinungs and grandpa jerry and everyone else i am so sorry i dont call more i feel so selfish but i just cant yet i think about you all the time i will be home in a few weeks and am planning to go to the cemetery i hope that will give me some closure and maybe ill be able to talk to all of you then love you and miss you paul al alexandra ackerackerdcccorg   wed  mar  0 dear elaine i am

seeing paul in there and seeing his smile or hearing him making a joke from across the room no matter how bad i felt that day his jokes always had a way of perking up anyones day even if they were ridiculous he always had a way of brightening everyones day and no matter who he met and who he saw he always said hello and he always had something positive to say six months later i can finally come to terms with the pain and tragedy i felt that day but the greatest pain i felt was knowing that one of my fellow alumni was lost we may not have been the greatest of friends but we were both regians and we shared a great bond pauls death may have killed me that day but his laugh and his jokes keep me going every day of my life and as long as he is in my heart along with all of the others we lost my life will keep going and my purpose will continue to be for others paul truly was a man for others and he will never be forgotten thank you paul for three years of laughs and thank you for an

the people who made whrw what it was on the evening of september th she gave me the links for pauls site as well as pipe dream online i remember reading ventis first post from about 0am that morning and staying up nearly all night talking with charlotte about the attacks about paul about how uncomfortably close to new york city everything seemed to be i remember that i had a more reliable internet connection than she had and so i was going through all of the survivor lists i could find to see if i could find pauls name on them i never met him but that didnt really matter i kept hoping and hoping that id find pauls name in there i checked pipe dream online religiously several times a day hoping that there would be news of paul being found being okay i still check it a lot just because ive been reading the guestbook a lot and was horrified when i saw what hackers had done paul was a beautiful person and his memory should be honored with the respect it deserves anyway i just wanted to say that i never knew paul and i only know a couple people who knew him directly but i wanted to pay my respects to his family and his friends he was a wonderful person to have touched so

to hold close all the good memories of your son i remember living in w right next door to him and hearing the sound of his laughter and their tv turned up really loud i also remember his great smile if you have questions that you are searching for an answer for i might have them since i was in the wtc that day please do not hesitate to contact me my heartfelt wishes go out to you and your entire family take care of yourself and each other sincerely laurie downey binghamton alumni  laurie downey   fri mar   i write to you with heartfelt  but probably very inadequate  words of condolence for the loss of you son paul we dont know each other but i write as a fellow parent a new yorker and a regis grad almost 0 years before paul surely the death of a child is the worst burden that parents can be asked to bear children are meant to carry on for their parents yet the loss of someone with so much promise who has already touched so many people is especially tragic you wont believe it now but time does provide some healing i lost a brother and my best friend too many years before either of them should have died but they died of natural causes your son died simply because of demented evil people if not now i pray that you someday will take comfort from the knowledge that you raised a wonderful kid providing that realization is the very least that god can do for you i didnt know your son but ive come across his name several times he was remembered at a mass at st ignatius a few days after the attacks regis held the mass with convent of the sacred heart where my daughter is a freshman and regis has remembered him in an alumni mailing and on its website our neighbor dwight darcy father of kieran also regis  was killed at the wtc and i prayed for your son at his memorial mass through a series of coincidences i was fortunate to find read and enjoy your sons website this morning he surely was a young man of talent and character someone who loved life and shared his talents and joy with literally hundreds of friends i alternately laughed and cried as i followed his european trip my wife and  children had visited italy this summer and my wife and i commented more than a few times how much sheer joy the �college grads seemed to have i was heartened to see the regis hotlink i went to regis almost 0 years before paul in those days we regularly sang the alma mater and we still do at the annual deo et patriae dinner which this year would have been at the windows of the world on  you may know it but it may not be a popular thing anymore the first stanza begins may ours be the noble heart strong to endure and ends may our be the heros part ready to do we are your sons fair regis our spirit comes from you everything ive read about paul says that he had a noble heart and that he was not only ready to do great things but had already done so he would want you to be strong to endure the pain inflicted on you i have never written to a complete stranger or even a letter to the editor hundreds if not thousands have already told you that paul was a treasure what can i possibly add just the thoughts and prayers of another parent god bless you and ease your pain trjkellyaolcom   sat mar 0  00 pm i have been reading pauls website every day for nearly the past six months i always want to write something but i never know what to say i grew up with paul our moms are very close friends i can remember spending many days with our moms and sisters during our st marks years paul  i used to hang out while i babysat kristen and eric and i never understood why elaine had to pay me to keep an eye on them if paul was home maybe he charged more per hour who knows i always thought of paul as a genius and i knew that he would be successful in whatever he did i referred to him as alex p keaton the last time i saw paul was probably over two years ago on the q train we had not seen each other in a while and he called my name and gave me a great big smile he told me all about what was his internship at the time which just further convinced me that he would do something great with his life i feel bad that we lost touch as we got older although i always knew what was going on in his life through my mom or when i would talk to elaine i had the pleasure of meeting his beautiful girlfriend at kristens sweet  i know that she is someone very special to elaine and john i just want to let you know how proud you should be to have raised such a wonderful man reading this website i see what an amazing person he turned into i truly admire you for your courage and strength not a single day goes by that i do not think of paul the two of you your dad kristen eric and aline are in my prayers every night lisa fama peachesaolcom  brooklyn ny  wednesday february    pm dear mr john leinung our family would like to express our sympathy to you and your family members because of your recent loss of your son paul there arent any words that can remove the pain that is felt when we lose a loved one in death but for manythe words recorded in the holy scriptures have proven to be a source of real comfort regarding those who are in almighty gods memory daniel  says and there will be many of those asleep in the ground of dust who will wake up to indefinitely lasting life just as you and your family remember the qualities of paul so does almighty god almighty god also has not forgotten the cruel violent actions of others that has resulted in untold suffering for many and he has promised ps  rev  to bring an end to all forms of violence sincerely mrs anna kinred deannacatskillnet  saturday february   0 am dear elaine and john i just discovered this amazing and moving website today while browsing other sites elaine you may remember we went to bishops together and the senior prom joyce and i remained in touch all these years although i met paul only once when he was about three at joyces  and i was impressed by him he ran around the backyard so exuberant and friendly and brighteyed  i was grieved when joyce emailed the news and now doubly so after reading the testimonies to what an extraordinary person he was it appears that he grew into adulthood remaining true to his essense free to grab life by the tail attracting the best of people by his magnanimous spirit it seems he achieved in his shortened life what many people never achieve in a lifetime you must be very proud i want to tell you through this site and through pauls personal website paul  and the tragedy of   has become more real to me and now i now feel a bit more that ive also lost a personal friend or nephew i wish id had the honor to meet him as an adult i just want you to know my heart aches for you and your family peace to you chris slawinski cslawinskitaconicnet millerton ny  friday february    pm paul although i never knew you i want to thank you for smiling down upon us all i found this website through a memorial page and i think its wonderful that your memory is being kept alive as for pauls family and friends my prayers and thoughts are with you please keep this site alive as a symbol to the world of americas neverending courage wendy wonstedhomecom maryland usa  wednesday february   0 pm i just wanted to say i feel some of the loss because my name happens to be paul j battaglia and immediately after september th i had people running up to me and hugging me sayingthank god youre alive they must have seen the name on a list and thought it was me i did lose a few friends that day including an old classmate of mine i just wanted to pay my respects and im deeply sorry  paul battaglia lizardpjbpnetscapenet  wednesday february    am est hi paul these past few days have been very stressful twice i came to your site to write and twice i couldnt due to the same type of hate fear  envy and ignorance that took you from those who loved you  some hacker a misguided kid i hope keeps wrecking the site aline also came on and saw the first desecration she like i cried i miss you so much the pain is physical like phantom limb pain my grief group tells me that this is how most mothers experience grief like a part of their bodies have been cut away kristen looked like a princess at her sweet  it was so hard for me i almost expected to see your smiling face at any moment then monday was five months that i have not seen or spoken to you i miss your voice your 0 second phone calls  your smile i miss you my son my son  how i wish id see you soon that all of this was just a bad dream today is valentines day you were always so good o me on this day i loved the cards and candy but valentines day is primarily for young lovers aline was having a bad week also she wanted to avoid this day then to make her more depressed two of her friends from nursing school were badly injured in a car accident they will live both face many months of rehab you know how close nurses become with their classmates ans teachers you always joked about how it wasnt really school because everyone was so touchy feely calling each other by first names and celebrating birthdays pregnancy announcements etc anyway our prayers are with them and their families aline visited grandpa for his birthday she baked him irish soda bread her baking skills are improving the bread was delicious she gave him two books i guess she knows how he loves to read im back at work part time caring for my patients is good but the mornings are tough especially on the days i would have taken the train with you i was so proud to be seen with you i loved to look at you i loved your hair the smell of your favorite after shave polo some days i wear it from the last bottle you touched it makes me feel close to you i am so tired so easily fatigued it is a struggle i go on for you and for dad grandpa kristen and eric someday i hope ill go on for me i love you for always like you forever as long as im living my baby youll be all my love mom

you were of that we got together with gregger for lunch today to celebrate the threeyear anniversary and we saved a seat for you we like to think that the radiothon was when we bridged the gap between guys who saw each other at the radio station every so often to friends hell if you can spend  hours with a person and still want to see them again after thats friendship on the way back from binghamton we made sure to listen to off the books and we know that somewhere in heaven you were singing along we all miss you very much paul happy anniversary seth  jeremy  sunday february 0  at  pst
