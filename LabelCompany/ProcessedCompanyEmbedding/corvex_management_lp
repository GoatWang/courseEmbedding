funds and investment companies activist or not struggled in  this was true for corvex management lp as the nearly  billion madison avenuebased hedge fund found itself in plenty of headlines but failing to reach its lofty performances from prior years corvex had extremely public spats with the kfcowning yum brands inc nyse yum during  it also disclosed activist positions in several other companies notably american realty capital properties inc and allergan plc the  performance for corvex was pulled down by two stock picks in particular the williams companies and platform specialty products corporation platform started its precipitous decline in late june  and share prices plummeted from around  per share to around  by december the williams companies lasted until august when falling oil and gas prices pushed the pipeline company down from  to  per share by early january  keith meister trained and funded by activists even in the hedge fund community few investors received the kind of training and financial backing that corvex founder keith meister received prior to the funds launch in  meister was widely known as carl icahns righthand man meister took icahns philosophy of being aggressive contrarian and confrontational and bolstered it with  million in seed capital from george soros the fund has been strong although not the strongest among activist hedge funds since its inception from its filing until q  corvexs portfolio outperformed the sp  by a threetotwo margin with most of that gap created in  and  more impressively the fund saw a x increase in reported market value since its first sec filing in december  that performance has been overshadowed in many ways by meister and his antics meisters style is controversial many fund managers are reserved quiet and straightfaced by contrast meister is outspoken and ornery even more so than his famous former boss in october  the wall street journal published an article that opened with the line keith meister takes things personally it went on to describe the activist as competitive and very emotional meister has been sued multiple times for his professional and interpersonal actions including a relatively highprofile showdown with the adt corporations board of directors on which meister once served in its lawsuit adt alleged that corvexs leader aggressively pressured and intimidated his coboard members to participate in a repurchase of corvex shares though his style has earned him a legion of detractors and critics in the financial media and across corporate boards meister is respected by power players in the fund community because he drives results hes intense in the best sense of the word said aurora investment management executive justin shepard one of meisters investor clients yum brands and corvex in q  corvex management acquired an activist stake in yum brands at about the same time third point management daniel loebs hedge fund took a much smaller position meisters group bought more than  million shares to become the largest shareholder loeb only grabbed  million shares for a distant second place as a consequence corvex became the lead activist although it is likely the two hedge funds worked with each other to promote shareholder value corvex entered the yum brands arena looking for a seat at the board of directors and a number of operational changes including the sale of kfc eleven and super chix and a spinoff of yums chinese division meister and loebs activist activities were strategically timed around a switch at yum brands for ceo when greg creed replaced longtime executive david novak creed who had been chief executive at taco bell from  to  unwittingly walked into a firestorm yum and creed initially balked at corvexs requests particularly the spinoff idea for the chinese division creed received support from novak who became executive chairman of the board after leaving the ceo slot although public dialogue between corvex and yum was amicable yet one by one the demands from meister and loeb fell into place by april  kfc eleven was closed by august super chix was sold to an investment group headed by founder nick ouimet about that same time china was hit with its worst stock market collapse in years leading to global concerns about a recession in  and the bursting of an obvious asset bubble in the far east chinese prospects were much more bleak and the yum china brand was thus less valuable on oct   the fastfood operator announced it would add keith meister to its board of directors meister bragged about the companys multiple avenues for unlocking significant longterm value and said he would work expeditiously to deliver that value to shareholders it was a muchneeded win for meister whose firm had suffered through a  drop in the yum stock price since making its position the company remained openly committed to keeping its china division intact though that did not last by oct   yum announced a plan to split yum china and yum brands arguing the move would increase shareholder value and allow more room for kfc and pizza hut to grow meisters fingerprints were all over the rushed decision the chinese division could now grow debtfree something meister argued was imperative creed said the speed of the decision was based on a lot of common ground between the two individual proposals corvex portfolio in  heading into  the corvex portfolio is dominated by four positions that combine to make up greater than  of total value this despite corvex officially holding more than  different stocks all told the corvex shares for yum brands at  billion the williams companies at  billion signet jewelers at  million and fidelity national financial at  million had a total market value greater than  billion as of q  as with most equity hedge funds corvex struggled to capture the performance of  and  meister and his staff responded to a sluggish stock market by turning over more than  of their portfolio including large acquisitions of aetna and allergan to capture the health care market and dumping energy plays particularly cheniere energy the corvex portfolio valued above  billion by mid entered the last quarter of the year having already dropped to  billion the corvex portfolio ended  with a heavy servicesector tilt although there were still strong positions in energy financials and health care if any sector was noticeably absent it was technology an area that meister and corvex have never vigorously pursued trending the trump economy news and analysis announcing the top  most influential

lp a seed of icahn enterprises is very much its own entity read our latest article to learn how theyve outperformed corvex capital was founded in  by keith meister formerly of icahn enterprises at icahn he served as ceo and as vice chairman of the board he took the skills he learned under the renowned carl icahn and founded his own activist hedge fund with the backing of another hedge fund giant george soros like all manager mondays everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data including the manager’s profile simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary the data used here omits the short side nonequity securities many nonus securities and all nonpublic information such as actual fund performance corvex management lp’s performance first let’s examine performance of this fund since it has begun filing the fund has returned  cumulatively against the sp’s  the fund had two solid years of outperformance compared to the market and has had a decent  through august the returns using a rolling six month time window offer insight into when the outperformance occurred recently the fund has experienced outperformance during late  and a large amount over the course of  but this does not demonstrate skills of the manager or provide insight into the portfolios aggregate dynamics so let’s dig in corvex management lp’s portfolio attributes asset growth position changes concentration corvex began filing in december of  and has seen almost a x increase in reported market value since december of  the market value of filed positions has almost doubled from b to b this rapid increase in asset growth must cause a change in the portfolio whether changes in market cap number of positions or concentration this growth probably stems from a mix of large capital inflows captured in the filings spikes below and from the good performance of the fund while assets doubled to over b the number of securities has decreased  from a peak of  positions to  currently if assets are growing while securities count decreases then the concentration of the portfolio must increase indeed the portfolio’s concentration has increased corvex has become heavily concentrated in their  securities while assets rose and this shifted from around  the historical average in december of  to  its peak currently this concentration has increased steadily in the top  securities the top  securities represent approximately  of the portfolio a highly concentrated book considering that the other  securities represent the remaining  this has steadily increased from  in december of  we are only examining the publicly filed long positions but we gain insight into how these dynamics are changing as the assets grow what does this increased concentration mean for the portfolio usually this will indicate that we should see higher winloss ratios as the portfolio focuses on generating most of its returns from fewer positions corvex management lp’s position breakdown and attribution at an aggregate portfolio level corvex has put up some impressive numbers it has owned  securities  have been up with  of capital allocated to those winning names which has led to approximately a x winloss ratio this means that each winning name has contributed twice as much to the portfolio as the average loser has detracted which is good but not fantastic for an activist let’s breakdown these aggregate stats into the underlying positions the top contributing position has been williams wmb generating bps with an average position size of  which is about the same contribution as the next three positions in comparison the top detractor yum detracted bps and only  securities have detracted more than bps demonstrating an ability to cut their losers digging into the williams position corvex built into the position over time and filed a d in december  after reaching an agreement for a board seat with williams in february  they increased their shares in march  williams has stayed above a  position since then with most of the contribution occurring from june  until presently williams’ contribution to the fund is driven by security selection meaning that the individual security generated contribution and not from the relative factors of the market and sector the effect of its activist investment seems to be taking hold and finally paying off another security that drove performance in  was fidelity fnf it has generated approx bps with an average position size of  corvex announced its investment through a d filing in october of  although the security initially detracted it began to outperform half way through  and is corvex’s second highest contributor there is a delay to the activist’s ability to generate value in these longer term investments and because corvex is still invested in them we will have to wait and see how it plays out breaking down the top contributors on a relative basis we see all but four of them have generated greater than  of their contribution from security selection corvex’s winners are winners because of security selection but let’s compare this to the largest average positions sorting on avg pos size reveals that of the positions greater than  only  of them have detracted value but williams is the only major contributor this provides context for the great batting averages but that their other investments have not paid off or did not generate the excess returns that an activist needs from its concentrated positions returning to the portfolio level metrics corvex has demonstrated an ability to pick and allocate to outperformers with a  batting average and  of capital deployed to those names this has led to around bps of security selection that is an impressive amount of stock selection corvex can picks names and allocate capital but has only had one large winner so far let’s dive under the hood and examine corvex’s investments across several additional dimensions to understand how this switch towards a more concentrated strategy has affected the book corvex management lp’s sector allocations the sector allocations initially centered on energy consumer discretionary and tech and became more balanced as it grew but in  the fund began to concentrate again and now focuses on consumer discretionary energy and financials which represent  of the portfolio while cutting telecom and utilities regardless of sector corvex has an ability to pick winning names every sector has above  batting averages and those below  industrials and materials make up less than  of the current long book in terms of the winloss ratios  of the portfolio is allocated to sectors that have greater than x winloss ratios as an activist we expect highwin loss ratios but corvex has shifted away from sectors that do not contribute like industrials technology and materials corvex has demonstrated an ability to identify the sectors they do not do well in and get out of them to focus on those that they perform well in telecomm has an incredible winloss ratio of x so let’s see what names are contributing to this outsized ratio lvlt abvt twtc are the largest contributions and positions but only one of these securities had a position size greater than  the winloss ratio stems from these medium size positions offering healthy contribution and only a few tiny positions detracting although a successful sector it has not been a heavy allocation for them but the few names they have invested in did well overall corvex has picked winning names across sectors but has learned over its short time to focus on the sectors it knows best and drive the best batting averages and winloss ratios these metrics across their favorites sectors will be something to follow because it is still early to judge the results of this newer concentration strategy corvex management lp’s market cap market cap has predominately been large cap and mid cap and has shifted upwards slightly towards more large and even mega cap names all batting averages are over  across the spectrum indicating they can pick names well but the winloss ratio is what matters for an activist across the spectrum corvex has above x winloss ratios with mega large mid and small cap having x x x and x ratios respectively although these are good they could be better again it is still early to tell how these longer and larger investments will pay off on a roic basis the larger buckets have performed better with each above  and only microcap a minor allocation in the past detracted across the larger buckets they have also generated alpha through stock selection overall they understand their investments on a market cap basis and have shifted into their best market cap bucket corvex management lp’s concentration returning to our question about concentration we see that corvex has shifted into larger position sizes since march of  specifically since december of  position sizes have more than doubled from  to  we know that the fund has become concentrated in these positions and that some of those names like williams and fidelity have generated returns but have done so slowly and steadily over  and  these names still need more time to play out in an activist play we can compare the portfolio’s returns against an equally weighted portfolio’s to understand if the fund has added value and we see two periods in  and  with outperformance we know that these are some early effects of their new concentration strategy like their positions in wmb and flf ultimately this concentration play has contributed to the portfolio but it is a little early to conclusively know because it is still running its course we know corvex has had good batting averages and decent winloss ratios meaning corvex picks winning names but needs time for them to generate those larger returns we expect from concentrated positions conclusion corvex may only have been around since  but this fund has demonstrated a skill for picking winning securities across sectors and market cap buckets they understand what sectors and market caps they are good at and know to focus on them while getting out of those that do not perform well for them corvex has solid winloss ratios in those areas but it could be better especially for an activist this can get better as these new investments have more time for the activist influence to gain transaction at the targeted companies even as corvex experienced extraordinary asset growth it maintained its ability to pick names and continues to adapt to its concentrated strategy although an icahn protégé started corvex it has found a style and skillset all its own as it continues to focus corvex is a manager that we will watch closely as it continues to grow and its investments have more time to play out three managers three styles an analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha what makes a successful hedge fund manager we believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question by looking at thousands of active manager portfolios we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance these patterns can be viewed as investment skill or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods in this article we use public ownership data and the novus alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers the three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success
