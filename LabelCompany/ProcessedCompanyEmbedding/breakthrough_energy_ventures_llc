world will use twice as much energy as we use today there’s good news in this more energy means better lives and stronger economies but it also means the world needs a new energy supply—one that doesn’t contribute to climate change climate change is a serious threat especially in the poorest parts of the world  we need affordable and reliable energy that doesn’t emit greenhouse gas to power the future—and to get it we need a different model for investing in good ideas and moving them from the lab to the market that is why today i along with an incredible group of people who care a lot about energy innovation am announcing the launch of breakthrough energy ventures bev a fund that will invest more than  billion in scientific breakthroughs that have the potential to deliver cheap and reliable clean energy to the world it’s the next step in an effort that began last december when we brought together private investors from around the globe who were passionate about solving this problem we formed the breakthrough energy coalition a group of entrepreneurs business leaders and institutional investors committed to help bring promising new zeroemissions energy technologies to market the coalition partnered with mission innovation an initiative of more than  countries and the european union to double their investment in clean energy research and development in the next five years   as i’ve argued before an investment in a true energy transformation requires governments research institutions businesses and private investors to work together and it’s hard to overstate how important this public commitment is government funding gives scientists the freedom to come up with bold new ideas and try to prove they will work but government research is not enough the world needs the skills and resources of investors with experience driving innovation from a lab to the marketplace the private sector knows how to take great research turn it into a great product and ultimately create a great company to bring a transformative technology to market it’s this type of publicprivate collaboration that’s given rise to advances in defense space medicine and information technology in fact it’s what brought these words to your screen right now during the cold war the department of defense developed a network of computers that could survive a nuclear attack and private companies saw an opportunity to expand this technology to the public together they created the internet when it comes to energy though this transition—from idea to product to company—is often complicated by the challenges of the market unlike a software start up getting a new energy technology from a lab to market takes a lot of infrastructure a lot of upfront capital and a lot of time the breakthrough energy coalition created bev to address some of those challenges in the energy market we are willing to wait a longer time for returns than other funds we have a higher tolerance for technical risk because we know it’s tough to determine which technologies will succeed in a complicated energy market we are led by our investors who are a unique group of global business leaders entrepreneurs energy experts and company builders who can help new companies navigate the challenges of building a business while developing partnerships with the companies and institutional investors who will help bring those products to scale the fund is also driven by science because of the technical nature of succeeding in an energy market we will build a team that knows as much about the science behind energy breakthroughs as the investment strategies necessary to build those businesses finally the fund is committed to discovering breakthroughs wherever they are the world has made remarkable progress in wind and solar over the past decade and these technologies will continue to play an important role in our zerocarbon energy mix i have argued before that innovative industries deploy the technology they have while developing the technology they need but because the scale of the challenge of providing reliable and affordable power without contributing to climate change is so vast and the future energy needs are so great we need to explore as many viable solutions as possible as i’ve learned through my work in business and philanthropy to be successful you have to get the most out of the technology you already have while developing the technology you still need after talking with some of the world’s greatest scientists energy experts and energy investors the coalition has developed a list of scientific priorities that will set us on the path toward the energy future we need we see this list as a “landscape of innovation”—essentially a roadmap that breakthrough energy ventures and others can use to focus their attention and guide their investment decisions over the next two decades in this landscape we’ve outlined five grand challenges corresponding to the biggest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions around the world electricity how can we deliver reliable affordable zerocarbon electricity to the world buildings how can we eliminate emissions from our homes offices hospitals and schools manufacturing how can we make everything we use without emitting greenhouse gases transportation how can we get around our communities and the world without emitting carbon food how can we feed the planet without contributing to climate change of course no investor can answer these questions alone that’s why in addition to funding new ventures breakthrough energy investors will help build a broader clean energy ecosystem we’ll explore new partnerships with governments businesses and institutional investors who want to be part of the global energy transition through these partnerships we will not only help organize more investments but we will also help research new solutions one of the coalition’s partners is the university of california which has an amazing capacity to innovate through their labs and universities in the coming years we’ll work with them to expand our research partnerships and identify the best ways to pull great inventions out of the lab and turn them into companies even though  billion is a significant step it is just one of many steps on the path to a sustainable energy future with patience flexibility collaboration and a clear vision backed by meaningful investment we the fund’s investors are confident the world can meet its energy needs in a way that is fair safe and sustainable and we’re excited about the role that breakthrough energy ventures will play in that effort previous article next article become a gates notes insider for access to exclusive content and personalized reading suggestions sign up share on

kleiner perkins caufield and byers vinod khosla founder of khosla ventures and jack ma executive chairman of the alibaba group press release seattle dec   prnewswire — today members of the breakthrough energy coalition bec have committed to invest more than  billion in breakthrough energy ventures bev an investorled fund that will finance emerging energy breakthroughs to deliver affordable and reliable energy with the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to nearzero “it is extremely exciting for us to launch this fund as the next step in the commitment made by the breakthrough energy coalition last year” said bev chairman bill gates “i am honored to work along with these investors to build on the powerful foundation of public investment in basic research our goal is to build companies that will help deliver the next generation of reliable affordable and emissionsfree energy to the world” about breakthrough energy ventures the world is demanding more energy and goods than ever before bringing about new opportunities for economic growth but also increasing pressure on our climate successfully navigating this dynamic requires a combination of new tools and solutions to help scale the most promising technologies we have today breakthrough energy ventures will collaborate with other investors governments research institutions and corporate partners bringing to the table an investorled fund with internal scientific expertise a longterm horizon and a tolerance and understanding of the investment risks required to transform energy markets the mission experience and global networks of bev investors will allow it to attract the best scientists entrepreneurs and private sector experts to guide the fund’s trajectory bev is not confined to any segment of the investment pipeline—it will build companies engage in traditional venture investment and have the ability to invest for growth as innovations mature today’s announcement continues the commitments made by these investors when the bec was launched last year alongside mission innovation an international collaboration to accelerate the pace of clean energy innovations through smart government investment bev will help build companies based on the promising technologies that come out of these countries’ scaledup public research pipelines in addition to the formation of the bev the bec today shared its “landscape of innovation” which illustrates the universe of technologies that public and private investors might support in order to lead us to a world of zero carbon emissions the landscape will serve not only as a tool for the bev to guide investment focus but also as a guide for other public and private investors committed to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions the scale of the challenge and the size of the opportunity presented by the global energy market will require investments far beyond the resources of the bev it will take the efforts of governments and investors from around the world because of the size of the challenges and opportunities the launch of the bev and sharing of the landscape is just the initial step for breakthrough energy in the future it will explore how the coalition can help organize an ecosystem of investment by engaging strategic corporate partners to coordinate expertise and capital to move these technologies forward led by our partners at the university of california we will engage a similar network of international research institutions to develop an investment pipeline of projects as well as identify other investment partnership opportunities board of directors statements “too often we let what we think we know limit what is possible when it comes to energy people say you cannot make money meet demand and also benefit the environment but we can and we will this effort will combine technological innovation and scientific knowledge with the investment expertise needed to transform energy markets together we’ll remind the world that visionary ideas make wonderful realities” – jack ma executive chairman alibaba group “bev is a fresh bold initiative to invest in energy breakthroughs it is building a global network of the best scientists innovators investors and business leaders bev’s mission is to find fund and accelerate the success of technologies and entrepreneurs who will create our zero carbon future” – john doerr chairman kleiner perkins caufield and byers “bev is taking the bold step to support companies in a complicated market with tremendous promise for changing the world while being a strong investment successful investing in any market requires patience for failure and identifying the best tools for addressing the idiosyncrasies of that market the investors leading bev will back some of the most innovative companies” – vinod khosla founder khosla ventures “the dearth of venture funding for clean energy technologies threatens to create a valley of death for the industry with emerging ideas unable to find the necessary capital to reach commercialization as an investor led effort breakthrough energy ventures is designed as a source of patient capital to spur innovation to meet the growing demand for lowcost clean energy solutions” – john arnold cochair laura and john arnold foundation “energy is one of the critical drivers for economic growth several parts of the developing economies still do not have access to affordable and reliable energy it is an immediate need to find and provide new energy sources that are affordable clean and reliable for every person on our planet breakthrough energy ventures will help build the companies that can solve and deploy new energy solutions everywhere” – mukesh ambani chairman and managing director reliance industries limited “we need to create new companies to push the boundaries of innovation the businesses that breakthrough energy ventures will fund and grow are going to develop the disruptive technology to help satisfy the world’s energy needs while also limiting the impact on our environment” – hasso plattner cofounder sap se about the breakthrough energy coalition the
