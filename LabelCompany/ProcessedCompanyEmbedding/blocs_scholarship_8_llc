platforms of   reviewscom the best scholarship search platforms of   introduction college is the most expensive it’s ever been with tuition rates rising an average of  every year the average undergraduate now finishes their degree with over  in student debt scholarships are one of the best ways to reduce these growing costs and scholarship search platforms exist to help students find the most relevant ones these platforms compile large databases of available scholarships and provide filters to allow students to maximize their searches we created this guide to review the best scholarship search platforms and instruct students on how to use them effectively to find as many opportunities as possible to determine the best scholarship search platforms we spent over  hours researching  of the most popular sites across five core metrics including search functionality scholarship availability ease of use application tools and additional helpful resources the best scholarship search platform was fastweb they scored the highest out of all  platforms because they were the easiest to use had the most tools and had among the most available scholarships with the highest dollar amounts this search engine is best for most students including high school undergraduate and graduate we also recommend cappex this platform scored consistently high in the most important categories of scholarship availability ease of use and tools it is the best and best for students who want to be able to apply for and track the status of a large number of scholarships what we’ll cover in this guide the major challenges students face when searching for scholarships how the right search engine can help students overcome these challenges what students should know before applying for a scholarship the most important features of a great scholarship search platform the best scholarship search platforms of  advice on early preparation to qualify for scholarships tips on applying for scholarships our full methodology and scoring process  the best scholarship search platforms of   fastweb fastweb is the top overall scholarship search platform in our review they scored consistently high marks across every metric they were the easiest to use as they required no registration to browse scholarship listings had both a searchable database and personalized matches and were mobilefriendly fastweb also had the most tools of any platform that fact combined with a high score for scholarship availability means fastweb is the best platform for finding scholarships managing deadlines and tracking applications the only thing that could be considered a drawback would be a smaller number of search results than some competitors but their overall thirdplace finish in that metric means they still outshine most they also scored thirdplace in search functionality so while the number of results you get may be smaller they’re most likely more relevant to you than sites with high results but few filters  cappex cappex ranked second place in our review mostly thanks to their large database only two other platforms returned more average search results and even then the margin wasn’t very wide that database combined with every desirable tool pushed cappex ahead of the competition cappex was also among the easiest platforms to use they have both a searchable database and personalized matches when a site has only personalized matches there’s no way for you to manually check the rest of the database for any opportunities that the matching filters might have missed we saw nothing to suggest that cappex gave bad matches but it’s always a bonus to be able to search scholarships by category as well the main drawback of the cappex platform is the fact that they offered no filters for military affiliation veteran scholarships may appear somewhere in their database but there was no filter that would allow you to be matched specifically to them  unigo strong scores in the most important metrics elevated unigo to a thirdplace finish by a wide margin the nearest competitors would have to make significant improvements to their platforms to overtake unigo’s spot meanwhile unigo would only have to make a few minor additions to its site to claim our firstplace position unigo ranked first in our most heavilyweighted metric search functionality they have the most filters and scholarship categories of any other platform at nearly  no other site allows you to get more specific in your search they also tied our top ranked platform in ease of use which means you should have no problems find the exact scholarship you need with minimal effort the only areas in which unigo falls short are tools and additional resources there are no deadline reminders or new match notifications so you’ll have to be more diligent in your searches and managing deadlines than some sites additional recommendations  big future big future is a scholarship search platform operated by the college board the administrators of the sat it is a basic but thorough site that allows you to search multiple scholarship categories at once including all of the key filters such as gpa test scores gender and ethnicity there are no saved profiles or personalized matches so you need to reenter your search every time you use it where big future stands out is in the wealth of additional college planning tools they offer they are a onestopshop for financial aid information and tuition planning there are eight different cost calculators as well as dozens of helpful articles videos and indepth guides even if you don’t utilize big future’s scholarship search they are worth checking out for their helpful tools alone if you use them in conjunction with one of our topranking search platforms you should have no problem planning your college finances  what should you know about scholarships what are scholarships at its most basic definition a scholarship is money for tuition and school expenses that doesn’t need to be repaid unlike a student loan it is a gift from a donor that you use to pay for college scholarships are sponsored by a variety of organizations including but not limited to schools businesses professional associations and religious groups how do scholarships work scholarships are set up exclusively for students who fit a particular profile one that is usually in line with the mission and ideology of the sponsor organization those qualifications can be based on academic achievement financial need ethnic background career goals or countless other factors the scholarship and its eligibility requirements are advertised by the sponsor organization any student who qualifies is encouraged to apply once the application period is closed a team of judges reviews each candidate and picks a winner how the award money is distributed depends on the scholarship sponsor typically the money is sent directly to the college on the winner’s behalf from there it is applied to any tuition or fees that the student owes if the money isn’t sent directly to the school it will most likely be sent directly to the winner in the form of a check how do you find a scholarship over  billion in scholarships were awarded to students last year with a number that large it would seem that an opportunity wouldn’t be hard to find but the opposite is true because there are so many scholarships spread across a wide variety of eligibility requirements searching through all of them is the hardest step in the process most students face the same common problems no single source for scholarship listings thousands of organizations sponsor scholarships every year and each advertises through their different channels a basic internet search takes too long and leaves a majority of opportunities undiscovered missed deadlines by the time many students find their ideal opportunities the deadlines have either already passed or are too close to complete all of the application requirements in time incomplete information when thirdparties advertise a scholarship outside of the sponsor’s website many do so with incomplete details students who apply based solely on thirdparty information might be unaware of key eligibility requirements that disqualify them from the competition scholarship scams the internet is filled with fake scholarship opportunities that most often include scholarships with application or redemption fees and awards that never materialize paid “guaranteed scholarship” search services and identity theft scams a quality scholarship search platform is the best solution to all of these problems these dedicated websites and mobile apps compile large databases of active scholarships from thousands of organizations and put them in one place for students to browse they most often include dozens of filters that allow you search only for awards that match your unique qualifications such as scholarships by ethnicity major test scores and extracurricular activity the best platforms constantly update their databases the benefit of which is twofold first they are always adding new opportunities second their information on existing scholarships is always uptodate meaning you’ll never find the perfect match only to discover later that the award doesn’t exist anymore or the eligibility requirements have changed they also allow you to save scholarships to a favorites list send you reminders when deadlines are approaching and do a good job of filtering out scams  how do scholarship search platforms work each scholarship search platform begins with a large database of scholarship opportunities complete with details and links to the sponsor’s application page from there they typically allow students to search the database in one of two ways search by category each scholarship is tagged with its key eligibility requirements and sorted into appropriate subdirectories you can then browse the different categories to see all of the scholarships of that type some allow you to select multiple categories at once to compile your own list personalized matches based on a profile before beginning your search you’re required to register for the site as you do you create a profile that includes all of your relevant personal and academic details such as age gender race desired major gpa test scores extracurricular activities organizational affiliations etc once you complete your registration the platform presents a list of scholarships that you qualify for based on the information entered in your profile the list is updated every time you log onto the site and some will send email or text alerts if they find a new match while you are away common features whether they have scholarships grouped by category or personalized matches some have both most search platforms share these key features search by keyword a simple search bar allows you to search within the separate categories or your personalized matches this is especially useful if you’re trying to find information on a specific scholarship for which you already know the name or sponsor search filters you can request to see only scholarships you qualify for by selecting category filters or entering them into your profile information the type and number of filters varies by platform some have a few while others have thousands the most common ones are hide unwanted results if you decide not to pursue a particular scholarship you can add it to a block list so that it won’t appear in your future searches save scholarships if you see an opportunity you’re interested in but want to continue your search you can add it to a favorites list so you can come back to it when you’re ready track applications once you save a scholarship to your favorites list you can then tag it with your application status will apply applied didn’t win won etc deadline alerts many platforms will also send you deadline alerts for the applications you saved but haven’t applied to yet drawbacks while they are extremely beneficial no search platform is perfect there are some potential drawbacks to keep in mind some sites limit your search results with additional filters rather than increasing them most sites show you an additional full category of results for every new filter you apply but a minority of them string those filters together into one large qualification the former site could show you hundreds of results while the latter might make it seem as if you don’t qualify for any scholarships at all for example if you are a hispanic student interested in studying biology and you play the violin the first site would show you scholarships for hispanics scholarships for biology majors and scholarships for violinists the second site would only show you scholarships for hispanic violinists studying biology few scholarships are that specific so you’re likely to return zero results it’s important to understand how the filters function on whichever platform you choose and adjust your search accordingly some sites don’t update their databases regularly enough new scholarships are made available every day while others expire just as often not every site updates their database quick enough to keep up with that pace if you use a site with an outdated database you could get search results for inactive scholarships or for awards whose eligibility requirements have changed many sites include sponsored ads and scholarships with your search results often but not always the sponsored ads are not traditional scholarships at all but rather scholarship challenges or lotteries they involve registration and participation on outside sites for what amounts to little reward money other times they’re for scholarships for which you don’t qualify under normal circumstances they would be filtered from your results but because they’re sponsored they’re included some sites do a good job highlighting sponsored results but it can still be easy to confuse them for the real opportunities no single site has information on every scholarship it’s impossible for any platform to keep up with every award available always perform diligent research outside of whichever search platform you choose to make sure you don’t miss out on any opportunities  what should students know before they search for a scholarship  how we reviewed the best scholarship search platforms to determine the best scholarship search platforms we first compiled a master list of the most popular sites we established that list by conducting basic internet searches studying existing rankings reading hundreds of student reviews and following the recommendations of several state departments of education and college admissions offices that gave us a starting list of  platforms  big future college board  start class  fastweb  scholarshipportal  scholarshipscom  student

financial aid services scholarshippoints not a database it’s a scholarship lottery us doe office of federal student aid not a unique database it links out to other resources this left us with  sites to review in detail next we determined the most important qualities of a great scholarship search platform based on praises or complaints from student reviews and discussions in college planning forums recommendations from college admissions professionals and trends found in our initial research of the most popular sites they are these five qualities became the core metrics of our ranking system lastly we divided each core metric into  smaller submetrics and graded each one on a scale from  to calculate the core metric score each core metric score was then weighed by importance to arrive at a search platform’s overall score here is a breakdown search functionality  searchable by keywordscholarship type location home state  college state gpa test scores major professionindustry

ability to to receive new scholarship notifications additional resources  any additional educational material for students any additional planning tools for complete scoring details see the section full methodology and metric walkthrough drawbacks to our reviewing process the top feature most students look for in a scholarship search platform is which site has the highest total number of listings unfortunately it’s impossible for us to get an accurate count of every database many sites don’t make that information available and those that do often give inflated or inaccurate numbers their total counts often include expired and inactive scholarships as well as single scholarships tagged in multiple categories because of that there’s no way for us to honestly grade any platform based on which has the “most” scholarships available instead we chose to grade the average search results of each site based on common student demographics which is an average number of results the typical student can expect it’s not an ideal measure but it’s the most objective to determine the average search results we created  profiles representing the “average student” based on data from the us department of education the us census bureau and the college board we made five profiles for each one of five race categories with each profile seeking one of the five current most popular degree majors our prospective students had a gpa and test scores equal to the national average for all incoming college freshman the races were caucasian african american hispanic asian native american the degrees were business administration nursing psychology biology teaching we searched every scholarship site using each profile recorded the number of scholarship results and then averaged them this gave us the best idea of what the typical student can expect to find when using each platform  guide to applying for scholarships the basics of scholarships financial aid terms and definitions before you start to apply for any scholarships you should familiarize yourself with some basic terms and definitions the following list isn’t exhaustive but it includes the terms you’re most likely to come across during your search award letter the financial aid award letter details all of the various forms of aid you’re eligible to receive through your prospective school including grants scholarships

which students are given tuition funds in exchange for parttime employment scholarships versus grants grants are similar to scholarships in that they are gift money for college that doesn’t need to be

were under  years old or enrolled in college at least parttime at the time of the death the award amount is equal to the amount of a maximum federal pell grant your search for college funding should include grants as well as scholarships especially considering that there are no extra steps involved to find them grant eligibility is determined based on the information you provide in the fafsa if you weren’t planning on filling out a free application for federal student aid you should there are enough different programs and opportunities available that everyone could potentially qualify for some form of assistance there are also a number of statelevel and schoolsponsored programs that rely on the fafsa for qualification you can find all of the information you need at the official fafsa website types of scholarships there are two main types of scholarships schoolsponsored school sponsored scholarships are affiliated with a specific institution they can either be funded by the school or an outside organization but they are only available to students attending that particular college information and applications can typically be obtained through the school’s financial aid office external external scholarships are sponsored by outside donors businesses organizations foundations etc they’re not affiliated with a specific institution and can be used at any school of the recipient’s choosing from there scholarships fall into a few broad categories needbased these scholarships are awarded based on demonstrated financial need many needbased scholarships are schoolsponsored and funded directly by the college their eligibility and awards are based on the financial information submitted to them through the fafsa meritbased rather than taking into account financial need these scholarships are awarded based on individual achievement academic artistic philanthropic etc demographic a large number of scholarships are set up for students that fit a specific demographic such as race sex age religion sexual orientation or residents a specific geographical region majorcareer many colleges and organizations sponsor scholarships for students who major in a specific subject area or who are training for a specific career athletic these scholarships are awarded to students based on their performance in a particular sport there are external organizations that award athletic scholarships but the majority are sponsored by the school itself when to start every scholarship has a different application deadline some can be as early as a year before you graduate high school you should start your search no later than the beginning of your junior year and start sending out applications during the summer before senior year if possible start even earlier many scholarships are offered year after year even if you can’t apply for one until your junior year knowing all of the details and requirements in your sophomore year will give you more time to make sure you meet all of the qualifications by the time you’re eligible finding a scholarship create a list of your qualifications first write down all your personal accomplishments academic achievements awards extracurricular activities and group affiliations next list out your ethnicity gender geographical location talents or passions military service your desired majorcareer and anything you can think of that defines you and makes you unique in some way each item on your list can be used as a filter on a scholarship search platform the more categories you fit into the more opportunities you’ll find use a scholarship search platform with so many scholarships offered by so many different organizations a basic internet search would never uncover them all a dedicated scholarship search platform will give you much better results and save a lot of time the best platforms have large continually updated databases with plenty of academic demographic and geographic filters to help you find every opportunity for which you qualify to find the right search platform for you refer back to our complete ranking of the best scholarship search platforms of  explore all potential sources in addition to internet scholarship searches think about smaller local sources to which you already have a personal connection if any of them offer scholarships not only are you uniquely qualified through your association with them but they might also have a much smaller candidate pool which increases your chances of winning some examples of potential scholarship sources are work if you currently have a job your company may offer career scholarships or tuition reimbursement for workrelated degrees if you don’t work inquire with a parent’s employer school networks your local school district may have scholarship opportunities available in a variety of academic categories if not the schools themselves then perhaps organizations associated with them for example if you’re a member of the school’s av club a larger regional av association may offer scholarships for technical degree seekers also if you’re planning on attending the same college as a parent check with alumni organizations for any potential funding opportunities community organizations veterans associations social clubs recreational sports leagues and more have been known to sponsor scholarships for students in their communities religious groups many churches and independent religious organizations sponsor scholarships for members campus organizations students already attending a college should research any opportunities with various campus organizations such as fraternities sororities academic groups social clubs and religious societies write query letters a query letter is a simple request for a scholarship application complete guidelines and a list of relevant deadlines dedicated scholarship webpages and online applications have eliminated much of the need for traditional queries but you should be prepared to write some just in case come up with a single template in which you can substitute specific information so you can send the same letter out to multiple sponsors and save some time search constantly to make sure you don’t miss out on any opportunities you should plan on searching and sending out multiple waves of applications not just one batch this is true even after you’ve started college there are plenty of scholarships available for current undergraduates as well as graduate students be aware of scams the most common scholarship scams are ones that charge for information or services that are otherwise freely available the key to avoiding all of them is to never pay for commercial financial aid services such as paying a company to fill out your fafsa for you or for scholarship searches the us department of education also warns against any scholarships that charge an application fee if you come across one in your search it’s most likely a scammer charging you to apply for an existing scholarship on your behalf if you ever have any questions about scholarships in general or the validity of any opportunity you find your safest most reliable sources for scholarship information are your library’s reference section your college financial aid office your state department of education use this government resource to locate your state’s doe agencies applying for a scholarship gather any required paperwork a majority of scholarships involve more than just submitting an application form most request that you include additional materials as well if you fail to submit them as a part of your application you’ll be disqualified from the competition supporting documentation the supporting documents required for a scholarship application help prove your eligibility for the award not all scholarships require every document but the most commonly requested ones are high school transcript this is a documented record of your entire high school career it details your yearly academic performance final grades standardized test scores and any honors or awards you earned you’ll need a transcript for any scholarship with a gpa requirement standardized test scores your test score report details your sat or act results and is usually included as a part of your high school transcript if not it can be obtained separately from your high school or the school district’s administration office any scholarship with a minimum test score threshold will request a copy of this report financial aid forms needbased scholarships request forms proving the student’s financial need students can often satisfy this requirement by submitting their fafsa information via a copy of their student aid report if not the sponsor will most likely have their own financial forms that need to be filled out letters of recommendation this is when someone writes a letter on your behalf recommending you as a person worthy of winning a particular scholarship it should directly address your qualifications for the specific award instead of just a blanket recommendation letters should come from academic or professional sources teachers professors employers clergy etc not family or friends curriculum vitae cv this is an educational resume it should list all of your academic accomplishments study experiences volunteer work hobbies interests and educationalcareer goals a lot of this information is included as a part of a scholarship application so you’re less likely to need to include a cv than you are other documents but you should have one prepared just in case essays judges often use personal essays to differentiate equallyqualified students and help make their decisions scholarship essays typically have a main prompt that asks you to discuss a certain topic or answer a specific question related to the mission of the sponsor organization they vary in subject length and format so you need to be prepared to write separate essays for each application instead of just one that you can submit multiple times other potential requirements supporting documents and essays are the most typical application requirements but depending on the type of scholarship and level of competition it could also require one of the following special projects majorcareerspecific scholarships are known to ask applicants to submit projects based on their desired area of study for example students applying for scholarships in one of the arts could be required to submit relevant short films songs paintings or photography portfolios written exams though they are rare some prestigious highvalue scholarships with heavy competition require applicants to take a written exam in addition to submitting their existing grades and test scores to help determine the winner interviews like written exams facetoface interviews with a scholarship review board are rare but there are awards that utilize them during the interview you will be asked basic questions about why you deserve the scholarship and how you plan to use it if you win your responses and overall demeanor impact the judge’s decision verify your qualifications a lot of scholarships have secondary qualifications beyond the primary one for example an academic scholarship might also have a demographic requirement take extra care to read through all of the qualifications to ensure that you’re truly eligible it’s also important to always be honest it might be tempting for you to embellish your accomplishments on paper to make them meet a scholarship’s requirements ultimately the judges will see through any deception and reject your application not only will you waste valuable time you will most likely get yourself disqualified from any future opportunities with that sponsor it’s always smarter to focus on the scholarships you are clearly eligible for than to lie or exaggerate to apply for one that you aren’t organize and track your applications try to use a scholarship search platform that includes tools for tracking your applications if the platform you decide on doesn’t have those tools or if you feel more comfortable using your own system here are our suggestions for staying organized make a separate file folder either physical or digital for each scholarship and sort them by application deadline gather any required documents and keep a separate copy with each file create a single document that you can use to track of all your applications in one place we recommend including the following information scholarship name scholarship sponsor contact information scholarship website address if applicable application deadline award amount summary of specific criteria gpa test scores volunteer hours etc a list of required documentation transcripts essays etc date you applied current status not yet applied applied – pending denied awarded total amount awarded if any keep a copy of every completed application and add it to your scholarship file throughout the process constantly update your files to ensure you don’t miss any deadlines forget to include any required documents apply for the same scholarship twice or skip over an opportunity because you thought you already applied for it manage your deadlines for every scholarship you need to give yourself plenty of time to gather all of the needed documents and complete any essays or projects you should start working on those requirements as soon as possible to ensure that you meet all of your deadlines this is especially true of recommendation letters with them you’re dependent on someone else to complete a key requirement someone who may not operate on your schedule you need enough time to request a letter allow the person to write it get it back and submit it with your application doublecheck and proofread everything typos look unprofessional and can easily cost you a scholarship with so many students competing for the same award grammar errors in an application or essay are an easy way for judges to disqualify you and narrow the field you also don’t want to look over an application after you’ve submitted it and realize you forgot to list an accomplishment such as an academic award that could have given you an advantage in the competition have a trusted friend or family member review your work before you submit it no matter how many times you’ve checked over it yourself essay interview and recommendation letter tips essay tips essays are the most common application requirement but they are also the most varied some have specific prompts and questions they want answered while others leave the topic up to you they also have different formats and lengths here are some standard guidelines you’ll want to keep in mind if an essay doesn’t have a prompt we have some suggestions for topics personal achievements an essay is one of your best opportunities to sell yourself to a scholarship judge your application already listed your personal achievements but now you have a chance to elaborate on them you’ll especially want to include any community service or volunteer work academic plans describe your educational goals tell the sponsor exactly what you plan on doing with the scholarship should you win it give them an idea of the impact their money will have on the world if they invest it in you social issuescurrent events discussing social issues and current events in an essay is a great way to illustrate your intelligence character and personality all at once just be sure to tailor the subject to the scholarship give your opinion or insight on an issue related to the mission of the sponsor mentors and influences give the judges an idea of who you are by describing mentors and role models describe learning experiences and specific instances where their example influenced your life if possible choose an influence from your academic major or intended career or choose someone in the same field as the scholarship sponsor interview tips your first step in preparing for an interview should be thoroughly researching the sponsor organization you need to have a solid understanding of their history and ideology so you’re prepared to discuss how you fit into their mission there’s no way to know what questions the interviewer will ask but you should prepare answers for some of the most common ones including tell us about yourself why did you apply for this scholarship why do you think you’re the best candidate for this scholarship what makes you stand out from other candidates what is the most important thing you’ve learned in high school what are your greatest strengths what are your weaknesses tell us about a time when you displayed leadership qualities how do you contribute to your community tell us about a specific event that greatly influenced you what are your academic goals what are your career goals where do you see yourself in five years how do you spend your free time what is a skill or experience you hope to leave college with what personal achievements are you most proud of what’s one of the biggest mistakes you’ve made and what did you learn from it tell us about a person that has influenced your life and how talk about a significant challenge you have encountered if you could do high school over again what would you do differently the interviewer may also ask you to elaborate on details from your application ask questions about your recommendation letter and its author or ask you to discuss current events take care to answer every question thoroughly and remember to be as specific about yourself as possible and relate your answers to the sponsor’s mission where applicable once you’ve prepared all of your answers you just need to remember some basic interview tips dress professionally first impressions count for a lot in an interview do your best to look like someone worth investing money in be honest if you’re in an interview you’ve already proven your qualifications and are in serious contention for the award there is no need to lie at this point study your application the interviewer will have a copy of your application and supporting documentation it’s important to remember everything you originally wrote so you don’t contradict yourself be yourself the interview is your chance to show the scholarship sponsor that you’re more than a gpa and a list of accomplishments be respectful but also relaxed your unique personality is what is going to set you apart from other candidates be grateful make sure you convey your appreciation for the opportunity the sponsor has provided and your excitement at the possibility of winning follow up with an email or letter the day after the interview to reiterate your gratitude recommendation letter tips the first step is decided who to ask for a recommendation here are the most important things to keep in mind don’t ask family or friends your family and friends have no credibility when it comes to official recommendations your letters need to come from objective professional sources choose someone who knows you well ask for a letter from someone who is familiar with your work and achievements as well as someone who understands your educational goals and the goals of the scholarship sponsor know your audience it’s important to tailor your letters to the scholarship for example if the scholarship is sponsored by a religious organization you should consider asking a trusted clergy member for a letter rather than your football coach make a list of potential writers group everyone on your list by their area of expertise so you have a pool of writers to approach as each unique scholarship opportunity arises once you’ve compiled a list of writers you need to solicit them for the letters to make the easier for them and to ensure that you get the letter you need follow these tips give them plenty of time the timeframe needs to be large enough that they can complete the letter without inconveniencing their schedule you also need to give yourself extra time between your request and the application deadline just in case the letter isn’t completed in that window make a formal request where possible arrange a meeting where you can ask for a recommendation letter in person be prepared for rejection and have a backup plan some people don’t feel comfortable writing recommendation letters for a variety of reasons if your first choice denies your request ask if there is someone else they could recommend if not have a second choice lined up from your list give your writer all the information they’ll need make sure they have your complete contact information any forms they needs to fill out as a part of the recommendation the sponsor title and description of the scholarship the contact information and address of the recipient scholarship deadline information a copy of your completed scholarship application for reference a full list of your academic achievements and a transcript your resume or cv a brief letter of your own reminding the writer of your past work together if a teacher a description of outstanding coursework in their class a past essay etc  groups with additional scholarship opportunities minorities in an effort to increase diversity on college campuses millions of dollars in minority scholarships are established by various organizations every year they were the largest category of scholarships in our research the search platforms we reviewed had over  separate filters for race and ethnicity there’s a good chance that you can find a scholarship that you qualify for based on your heritage alone but adding a minority status to your other qualifications increases your chances even more specifying a minority race in our searches resulted in an additional  scholarships for every area of study students with disabilities the americans with disabilities act makes mandates that colleges be physically accessible to students with disabilities but economic disadvantages can keep higher education financially inaccessible for some according to the bureau of labor statistics and the national disability institute people with disabilities have higher unemployment lower income and higher living expenses than those without which makes paying for college more difficult than usual fortunately there are a large number of scholarships set up to counteract that problem disability scholarships were the second largest category in our review we found nearly  different filters for disabilities of all kinds in addition to general scholarships for students with disabilities adding one of those filters to our searches also resulted in  more scholarships per area of study veterans aside from the federal programs established for military members like the gi bill and various grants there are also a large amount of private scholarship opportunities set up exclusively for veterans veteran scholarships were the third largest category in our review with over  separate filters in addition to general military service scholarships there are awards for every branch of service and for a large number of different conflicts such as those for korean vietnam iraq and afghanistan war veterans veteran scholarships are also one of the few categories where family members are just as likely to qualify as the veterans themselves if you are the child of a veteran or active duty service member be sure to specify that in your profile as it could open you up to a lot of opportunities that you would otherwise miss women you’ll notice that one of the first things a scholarship search profile asks for is your gender the reason is that there are a large number of scholarships set up exclusively for women not only are there scholarships where being a woman is the only major qualification adding a female filter to our searches also resulted in  more results per category there were a particularly large number of scholarships offered for women seeking to enter traditionally maledominated fields such as science technology engineering and mathematics if you’re interested in a stem career be sure to research those opportunities  full methodology and metric walkthrough how we selected the platforms in our review we conducted our own research reviewed existing rankings and followed the recommendations of college admissions professionals to compile an initial list of the  most popular scholarship search platforms we then applied the following minimum criteria to narrow down that list for our final review must not be a scholarship lottery site must have a unique searchable database of outside scholarships must include results for more than a single demographic must be regularly updated with new opportunities must make an effort to remove inactive scholarships must not charge for otherwise free financial aid services this gave us a final list of  scholarship sites how we scored our methodology based on our research we determined the five most important aspects of any search platform which became our core metrics we then established key features that we organized as submetrics under the appropriate core categories after grouping the submetrics into their core metrics we assigned each a score of  for every search platform reviewed the final core metric score was averaged from the submetric totals for example our  overall platform fastweb ranked  in scholarship availability with a score of  that core metric is made up of five submetrics here’s how fastweb scored for each once all of the core metrics were scored we applied percentile weights based on importance took their average and calculated their final ranking highest scoring scholarship search

you could use any search engine to find scholarships but it would be up to you to work through the thousands of results to find the opportunities for which you’re eligible search filters save you time by narrowing those results to only the scholarships most relevant to you we evaluated each site based on their inclusion of the most relevant popular and lucrative categories the more search options available to you the more likely you are to find a scholarship that matches your exact qualifications therefore this is our most important metric submetrics searchable by keyword location home state

would probably be our top metric unfortunately it’s impossible to get an accurate count of the number of awards in any database so we couldn’t weigh this metric as the heaviest that said we do recognize its importance to students so we made it our second metric and developed a system to objectively grade it we started by creating  profiles representing the “average student” based on data from the us department of education the us census bureau and the college board we made five profiles for each major race category caucasian african american hispanic asian and native american the profiles in each race each sought one of the five current most popular degrees business administration nursing psychology biology and teaching our prospective students had a gpa and test scores equal to the national average for all incoming college freshman we used each profile to search every platform we graded each on the average number of scholarships returned during those  searches as well as their average total value we also graded each platform on its relevance to students at all stages in their college careers since tuition doesn’t end after freshman year the highestranking sites include scholarships for incoming freshmen current undergraduates and graduate students alike submetrics we used average scholarship results average scholarship total value prospective undergraduate scholarships current undergraduate scholarships graduate scholarships to score the average results and total value we graded the platforms against each other we ranked them from highest to lowest then

students will have a hard time finding the scholarships they need therefore this metric is our third most important we graded each site based on whether it required registration before you could view any scholarships had a searchable database rather than simple lists and if it provided personalized results based on an academic profile we also tried registering and searching on several mobile devices to determine if each platform was mobilefriendly as is becoming necessary in an increasingly mobile society submetrics we used registration requirement searchable database personalized matches
