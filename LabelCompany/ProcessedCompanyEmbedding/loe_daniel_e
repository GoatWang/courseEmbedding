popular press smells blood in the water thanks to the looming shark fin curve of generic competition facing many blockbuster drugs the impending patent revenue cliff of the next five years puts more than  billion of branded drug sales at risk as the csuite attempts to fill the revenue gap its timely to revisit the armamentarium of loss of exclusivity loe tactics—particularly for subblockbusters that often fly under the radar of senior leaderships attention companies have historically withdrawn support from products as loe approaches backing into strategies dictated by their overall portfolio strategy however our analysis of us drugs that have recently lost patent protection suggests that many brands facing generic competition may be leaving money on the table by failing to consider a range of costeffective options traditional strategies may be too costly or risky for some subblockbuster agents still depending on initial market size brand loyalty and perceived switching costs brands can successfully employ a portfolio of tactics to bolster unit sales or alternatively increase profitability in the face of declining unit sales importantly brand teams should explore their strategic options three to five years before loe as some tactics need to be implemented ahead of the curve the first generic typically enters with a  percent to  percent discount below branded counterparts and savings may reach  percent by  months surprisingly there is a wide range of sales retention postloe from zero to  percent and by extension a wide range of revenues are in play postloe our analysis suggests brand teams can diagnose whether a brand is likely to retain sales toward the higher or lower end of this range based on attributes of the product and market armed with this information brand teams can—and should—decide which strategic levers merit deployment to maximize postloe sales diagnosing the market we identified two main attributes leading to higher postloe sales retention first smaller markets today typically mean larger postloe opportunities tomorrow unsurprisingly drugs with over  million in us sales tend to face twice as many competitors as drugs with smaller market sizes additionally highutilization highcost drugs sit top of mind for payers attracting active formulary management and restrictions while lowerutilization drugs often fly below the radar accordingly subblockbuster drugs are particularly wellpoised to deploy strategies aimed at retaining postloe sales second among all brands those with higher perceived clinical switching costs stand wellpositioned to carve out brandloyal niches among prescribers especially specialists and patients this played out most recently and dramatically with the antiepileptic drug class patient advocacy groups and specialists battled to pass substitution carveouts blocking pharmacylevel generic substitution for epilepsy drugs such as keppra but leaving drugs used primarily for migraine such as imitrex and topamax floundering whereas keppra maintained  percent of unit sales after  months topamax and imitrex shrank to  percent and  percent of their unit sales after only six months ultimately research capturing physician patient and payer perspectives on switching costs can help prospectively identify which core or adjacent indications offer the greatest opportunity hindsight is
