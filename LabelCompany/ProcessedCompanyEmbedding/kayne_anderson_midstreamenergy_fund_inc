distribution history for kmf information on tax character of distributions our distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income a portion of which may be qualified dividends or capital gains distributions of our ordinary income plus net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses will be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits if our distributions exceed our current or accumulated earnings and profits the distributions will be treated as a return of capital to our common stockholders to the extent of each stockholder’s basis in our common stock and then the amount distributed in excess of such stockholder’s basis would be taxed as a capital gain common stockholders will receive a form  from us and will recognize ordinary income only to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits because the cash distributions received from the mlps in our portfolio are expected to exceed the earnings and profits associated with owning such mlps a portion of our distributions may be paid from sources other than our current and accumulated earnings and profits the table below summarizes the

structure each companys business and affairs are managed under the direction of its board including the duties performed for the company pursuant to its investment management agreement among other things the board of each company sets broad policies for the company approves the appointment of the companys investment adviser administrator and officers and approves the engagement and reviews the performance of the companys independent registered public accounting firm the role of the board of each company and of any individual director is one of oversight and not of management of the daytoday affairs of the company the board of kmf currently consists of five directors four of whom are independent directors the board of ked currently consists of seven directors four of whom are independent directors as part of each regular board meeting for each company the independent directors meet separately from kayne anderson and as part of at least one board meeting each year with the companys chief compliance officer the board of each company reviews its leadership structure periodically as part of its annual selfassessment process and believes that its structure is appropriate to enable the board to exercise its oversight of the company under each companys amended and restated bylaws the board of each company may designate a chairman to preside over meetings of the board and meetings of stockholders and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the board neither company has an established policy as to whether the chairman of the board shall be an independent director and believes that having the flexibility to designate its chairman and reorganize its leadership structure from time to time is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders presently mr mccarthy serves as chairman of the board of each company mr mccarthy is an interested person of each company as defined in the  act by virtue of his employment relationship with kayne anderson each company believes that mr mccarthys history with the company familiarity with the kayne anderson investment platform and extensive experience in the field of energyrelated investments qualifies him to serve as the chairman of the board each board has determined that the composition of the audit and nominating committees being independent directors only is an appropriate means to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from the chairmans status as an interested person of the company each board believes that its board leadership structure  having the chief executive officer serve as chairman of the board and audit and nominating committees comprised solely of independent directors  is the optimal structure for the company at this time because the chief executive officer has the most extensive knowledge of the various aspects of each companys business and is directly involved in managing both the daytoday operations and longterm strategy of each company each board has determined that mr mccarthy is the most qualified individual to lead the board and serve in the key position as chairman each board has also concluded that this structure allows for efficient and effective communication with the board currently neither companys board has a designated lead independent director instead all of the independent directors play an active role serving on the board the independent directors constitute a majority of each companys board and are closely involved in all material deliberations related to the company the board of each company believes that with these practices each independent director has an equal stake in the boards actions and oversight role and equal accountability to the company and its stockholders    table of contents board role in risk oversight each companys board oversees the services provided by kayne anderson including certain risk management functions risk management is a broad concept comprised of many disparate elements such as for example investment risk issuer and counterparty risk compliance risk operational risk and business continuity risk consequently board oversight of different types of risks is handled in different ways and the board of each company implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through board committees in the course of providing oversight each board and its committees receive reports on the companys activities including those related to the companys investment portfolio and its financial accounting and reporting each board also meets at least quarterly with the companys chief compliance officer who reports on the compliance of the company with the federal securities laws and the companys internal compliance policies and procedures the meetings of the audit committee of each company with the companys independent registered public accounting firm also contribute to board oversight of certain internal control risks in addition each board meets periodically with representatives of the company and kayne anderson to receive reports regarding the management of the company including those related to certain investment and operational risks and the independent directors of each company are encouraged to communicate directly with senior management each company believes that board roles in risk oversight must be evaluated on a casebycase basis and that the boards existing role in risk oversight is appropriate management believes that each company has robust internal processes in place and a strong internal control environment to identify and manage risks however not all risks that may affect a company can be identified or processes and controls developed to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects and some risks are beyond any control of the company or kayne anderson its affiliates or other service providers diversity in nominees for director the nominating committee of each company evaluates candidates qualifications for board membership the nominating committee of each company takes into account the diversity of a particular candidate and the overall diversity of the board when considering and evaluating candidates for director while the nominating committee of each company has not adopted a particular definition of diversity or a particular policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying candidates when considering a candidates and the boards diversity the nominating committee generally considers the manner in which each candidates leadership independence interpersonal skills financial acumen integrity and professional ethics educational and professional background prior director or executive experience industry knowledge business judgment and specific experiences or expertise would compliment or benefit the board and as a whole contribute to the ability of the board to oversee the company the nominating committee of each company may also consider other factors or attributes as it may determine appropriate in its judgment the nominating committee of each company believes that the significance of each candidates background experience qualifications attributes or skills must be considered in the context of the board as a whole as a result the nominating committee of each company has not established any litmus test or quota relating to diversity that must be satisfied before an individual may serve as a director each board believes that board effectiveness is best evaluated at a group level through its annual selfassessment process through this process each board considers whether the board as a whole has an appropriate level of sophistication skill and business acumen and the appropriate range of experience and background communications between stockholders and the board of directors stockholders of either company may send communications to the companys board communications should be addressed to the secretary of each company at  main street  th floor houston tx  the secretary of each company will forward any communications received directly to that companys board    table of
