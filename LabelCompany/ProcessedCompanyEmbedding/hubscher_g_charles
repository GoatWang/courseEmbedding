university avenue mount pleasant mi  united states   our mission is to enhance the quality of life for all citizens of isabella county now and for generations to come by holding and attracting permanent endowed funds from a wide range of donors addressing needs through grant making and providing leadership on key community issues g charles and janice l hubscher fund donate now the g charles and janice l hubscher fund is a community impact fund started in  by mr and mrs hubscher as a way to provide the foundation with funds that could be used to address the changing needs of isabella county residentswhile there are many funds within the foundation set up to be put to use for specific causes community impact funds are a good way to give to a wide array of community needs every year the fund is not limited to a field of interest or designated to a particular organizationboth mr and mrs hubscher have been highly involved within the mt pleasant community and the community foundation for several years but it was the time mr hubscher spent on the foundation’s grant review committee which piqued his interest in starting a community impact fund he observed that over the years they were presented with a number of grants that were worthwhile but were not able to be matched with a particular donor advised or field of interest fund “that’s why there’s a need in the foundation for more community impact funds” mr hubscher said  “community impact funds give the foundation the flexibility to support grant requests which may otherwise be difficult to fund” according to mr hubscher “you don’t need everything in unrestricted but you do need a core group of community impact funds available at the community foundation” as more community impact endowment funds like the hubscher’s are started the community foundation will be able to increase its support to a gamut of causes in midmichigan hubscher g charles top holdings whalewisdom search all search f filers only
