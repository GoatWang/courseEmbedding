the dividends are then taxed as personal income this system similar to real estate investment trusts effectively avoids the double taxation of corporate income contents  characteristics of royalty trusts  canadian royalty trusts canroy  halloween massacre  history of royalty trusts  publicly traded royalty trusts  former publicly traded royalty trusts now liquidated  see also  references  external links characteristics of royalty trustsedit royalty trusts typically own oil or natural gas wells the mineral rights of wells or mineral rights on other types of properties an outside company must perform the actual operation of the oil or gas field or mine and the trust itself in the united states mayambiguous have no employees shares of the trust generally trade on the public stock markets but the trust itself is typically overseen by a trust officer in a bank they are a powerful investment tool for people who wish to invest directly in extraction of petroleum or mining of other materials but who do not have the resources or risk tolerance to buy their own well or mine additionally since trusts often own numerous individual wells oil fields or mines they represent a convenient way for the average investor to diversify investments across a number of properties also since commodities are considered a hedge against inflation the popularity of royalty trusts as investments rises as interest rates rise and their shares often rise as a result these trusts often attract investors with their relatively high yields in  their distributions were often in the  to  percent annual range this makes the shares sensitive to interest rates as share prices are likely to decline in periods of rising interest rates and to rise when interest rates fall additionally royalty trusts in the united states and canada usually involve oil and gas fields or mines which are at or past their production peak and will gradually decline in output as well as revenue however the infrastructure to develop them has already been built so that an investor can expect a reasonably steady income stream in addition to allowing investors to achieve high distribution returns especially during periods of low interest rates royalty trusts allow investors to speculate directly on commodities such as gas oil or iron ore without having to buy futures contracts or use the other investment vehicles traditionally associated with commodities—since the trusts trade like stocks during times when a commodity price is rising the share value as well as the dividend return of a trust engaging in production of that commodity will rise as well canadian royalty trusts canroyedit royalty trusts are found mainly in canada and the united states there is also one in germany canadian royalty trusts called canroys or canroys typically trade on the toronto stock exchange while some of the larger trusts also trade on the new york stock exchange canroys usually offer higher yields than us trusts for noncanadian investors this higher yield is reduced by the  foreign tax withholding that is absent in the us trusts the most significant difference between canadian and us royalty trusts involves their legal status in their respective countries in the us trusts are not allowed to acquire additional properties once they are formed since they are restricted to their original properties – for example a group of oil fields or naturalgasbearing rock formations—they can be expected to be depleted over time the royalties they pay out will correspondingly decline and eventually the trust will be dissolved in canada trusts may be actively managed and run as businesses they may have employees issue new shares borrow money acquire additional properties and may manage the resources themselves bell canada enterprises corporate unit yellow pages group converted to yellow pages income fund on june   making it the first highprofile conversion to the trust structure their income fund raised billion in the process according to a  article in canadian energy law the royalty trust and income trust markets trace their origins to  and  respectively as interest rates declined during the period and beyond these trusts became popular since they provided lofty yields well in excess of the prevailing interest rate payable by corporations with similar credit ratings the reason for the discrepancy was primarily due to the fact that royalty trusts and income trusts were flowthrough vehicles that avoided the payment of corporate level tax the yields payable by these trusts varied but were typically in the  –  range — doug richardson  richardson argued that by  foreign asset income trusts faits had revived interest regarding income trusts in canada because faits involve assets outside canadian borders they are not subject to traditional specified investment flowthrough sift rules halloween massacreedit in   billion of new trust conversions were announced the largest

royalty trusts were increasingly popular because they do not pay corporate tax rather they pay out most of their income in distributions to unit holders who then pay tax on those distributions on october   thenfinance minister jim flaherty made his now famous proposal to introduce new rules — later known as specified investment flowthroughsift rules — nicknamed the halloween massacre under prime minister stephen harper — who was sworn into office february   after winning against the incumbent paul martin — the canadian federal government announced the elimination of the loophole that placed over  income trusts at a tax advantage over other corporations starting in  income trusts with the exception of those focused on real estate would be subject to a tax on trust distributions at the full  rate existing trusts would have a fouryear transition period  to  whereas newer trusts such as the proposed bell canada trust would be applicable in  what prompted the move was that the trusts were costing the canadian government upwards of  each year in lost revenue flaherty described the conversion of corporations into royalty trusts as a growing trend to corporate tax avoidance which was hurting the canadian economy and defended his response as measured if the trend of trusts conversions was not stopped it was estimated that the canadian federal and provincial governments would lose  billion annually in tax revenue immediately after the announcement share prices of the trusts dropped penn west exploration then penn west energy trust — still referred to as known as penn west petroleum in the media —  in an interview in january  matt donohue an analyst at ubs ag in calgary argued that the growthandincome model was bruised not broken with income trusts converting back

shareholders this model is least lucrative in periods of weak commodity prices since the announcement of the canadian tax fairness plan approximately citation needed of canadian royalty trusts canroys have either converted to corporations merged with other companies or simply liquidated while the tax fairness plan did not require a conversion to corporate status most companies found it beneficial
