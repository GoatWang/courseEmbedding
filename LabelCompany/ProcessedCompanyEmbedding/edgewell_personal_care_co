like to turn the call over to david david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co thank you chris and good morning everyone before sandy takes you through the results ill briefly comment on sales and category trends in the quarter the impact to our outlook for sales in fiscal  and our priorities for driving growth going forward overall we met our outlook on the top and the bottom line this quarter despite strong competitive pressure and a pretty significant sequential deceleration of growth across all of our categories in the us in wet shave we continue to compete well gaining share globally and in the us in mens womens and disposables and in terms of sales we returned to a growth internationally and we grew womens and disposables on a global basis however sales decline in the us behind category softness and a tough comp to a year ago against our hydro next generation launch sun and skin care sales were strong in both north america and international north america sales were heavily influenced by the timing of customer order patterns versus year ago but overall were pleased with the start of the season the new products were offering and the incremental distribution were getting our fem care performance in the quarter came in below expectations as soft category metrics and intense competition added to the anticipated declines in sport pads and liners as we look to the remainder of the year our revised top line outlook is for flat or organic sales versus a year ago reflecting the incremental weakness in fem care as well as our expectation of continued category softness in the us wet shave its difficult to predict where the categories will go from here but based on what we saw in the second quarter our outlook does not assume a material improvement particularly in the measured wet shave category in the light of expected competitive pressure this has been a difficult environment over the past several quarters but despite that weve competed well and going forward we expect to continue to compete well so let me spend a few minutes just discussing our strategies and the drivers of growth going forward our first strategic pillar is to continue to focus on and improve our fundamentals by one building brand equities by increasing consumer engagement two continue to deliver compelling innovation three leverage our full portfolio in wet shave to better serve all consumer segments and pricing tiers and four deliver unique and effective category solutions in each of our segments now however that alone wont be enough to drive sustained growth the external environment is rapidly changing reflecting quickly changing consumer behavior and has the purchase empowered by digital and the mobile new and increasingly aggressive competitors and continued channel shifting and the evolution with the challenges that come with these changes also comes opportunities the goal of our second strategic pillar is to rapidly reconfigure our business against those growth opportunities that we see in the marketplace in investing in them to accelerate top line over the mediumterm some of the areas that were focused on are first significantly growing our eretail business weve gained share within omnichannel and in pure play eretail channels in each of the last three years however we remain underindexed in these channels and as we organize resource and invest in this area we see significant growth potential for example we just launched our first shaving flagship store with tmall the leading ecommerce site china second launching our own directtoconsumer sites here we think about the opportunity less in the terms of shortterm sales and more in the terms of strengthening our digital capabilities generating new consumer insights and supporting our overall ecommerce efforts we think weve developed a unique and a differentiated proposition that accomplishes this builds brand equity and complements our overall channel strategy we plan to launch it first in the us in the next month or so third targeting and investing in the key growth channels beyond eretail around the world like club value channels et cetera for continuing to pursue disciplined ma to enter new growth categories and adjacencies for example our bulldog acquisition is going very well and were encouraged at our ability to expand it geographically we would love to replicate this model and build on the bulldog example and finally continuing to expand our international scale and footprint weve been growing our international business in the midsingle digits we look to accelerate that growth through investment into china both on and offline continued expansion of sun care markets and the rollout of bulldog and other grooming products to realize those goals our third strategic pillar is to build organizational capabilities and generate resources and funds to support these initiatives and to fund these investments for example our cvs initiative is progressing well and were working to institutionalize it as our way of doing business this complements several productivity projects that are well underway including trade spend and the marketing mix management where were looking for continuous improvement on event list and  roi finally we look to continue our strong track record of production cost improvement driven by our continuous improvement culture and process as well as footprint changes over time so as we head into the second half of the fiscal year im pleased with the great work done by our colleagues around the world who continue to drive results in the midst of a challenging and a changing world we recognize and understand those challenges and are executing with urgency the three strategic pillars that ive just outlined we reorganized the organization recently to accelerate our efforts to realign our resources and investments against growth opportunities while continuing to focus on cost reduction and productivity because of those efforts combined with our full wet shave portfolio and our robust innovation pipeline were confident we can drive growth over the medium term and deliver on our bottom line goals and a balanced financial algorithm thanks and with that ill hand it over to sandy sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co all right thank you david and good morning everyone ill cover our second quarter business performance beginning with a few headlines net sales in the quarter were  million flat on a recorded and organic basis with growth in sun and skin care offset by declines in wet shave and fem care from a geographic perspective north america organic net sales were down  while international organic net sales increased  we delivered  million of adjusted ebitda and  adjusted eps in the quarter overall these results are in line with our outlook to the first half of the year and were pleased with this progress particularly in line with the recent weakening category trends in the us turning to sales reported sales were flat in the quarter and also flat on an organic basis excluding a  million benefit from the bulldog acquisition and a  million negative impact from currency lower volumes of approximately  were roughly offset by improved price mix and lower promotional spend segment results vary but improved volumes were most notable in sun and skin care due largely to timing but also improved distribution strength in sun and skin care helped partially offset lower feminine care and wet shave volumes price mix was favorable across all segments on lower promotional spending as well as improved pricing in international ill review more details of these drivers from a segment perspective in a few minutes turning to gross margin gross margin was  a decrease of  basis points as favorable price mix and volume growth in sun and skin care were more than offset by lower volumes in wet shave and feminine care and higher product costs related to the transition of feminine care manufacturing from montreal to dover delaware ap expense as a percent of net sales was  down  basis points primarily driven by the higher level of spending last year in support of the rollout of the new hydro products sga expense was  of net sales excluding prior year spinrelated costs sga increased  primarily driven by investments were making in the current year in support of zerobased spending and the growth opportunities that are part of our strategies as david discussed were investing to reconfigure out business to better leverage the growth opportunities we see in the marketplace in order to accelerate top line over the medium term in particular this quarter we ramped up spending behind both china and ecommerce growth initiatives we expect to see the benefits of our zerobased spending initiatives begin to positively benefit sga as we move through the second half of the year other income was  million compared to  million in the prior year primarily reflecting the impact of a net gain from foreign currency contracts and revaluation of nonfunctional currency balance sheet exposures interest expense was down compared to the prior year reflecting lower debt level this year and the effective tax rate was  versus  in the prior year excluding tax associated with restructuring expenses the effective tax rate was   basis point improvement from the prior year due to a more favorable mix of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions net of all these factors gaap diluted eps was  in the quarter as it compared to  in the prior year and adjusted eps for the quarter was a  compared to  net cash used by operating activities was  million for the first six months of fiscal  compared to approximately  million in the prior year the improvement reflects discretionary funding of certain international pension plans of approximately  million in the prior year partially offset by higher current year deferred compensation payments as well as increased net outflows from working capital driven by the timing of receipts and payments including a tax refund received in the prior year cash flow from operations and free cash flow is expected to be generated in the second half of the year and therefore we continue to estimate positive operating cash flow for the full year and expect free cash flow to be approximately  of gaap net earnings so those are our results on a total company basis let me now turn to our segment results starting with wet shave organic net sales decreased  in the quarter largely driven by volume declines in north america mens systems as expected and overall us category softness while international wet shave net sales returned to growth the volume declines were partially offset by lower promotional spend and pricing we grew sales in both womens systems and disposables globally as we had good initial performance from new innovation including improved hydro silk for women and the new quattro you disposable for women as well as distribution gains in disposables notably in the us and latin america within mens systems north america declined  this quarter versus significant growth of over  last year driven by the nextgeneration mens hydro launch in new distribution importantly the north america mens segment sales improved on a twoyear basis internationally mens systems net sales was relatively flat a sequential improvement versus the first quarter reflecting some improvement in japans top line results as we execute new pricing we discussed last quarter rounding out wet shave shave preps declined approximately  million in the quarter showing improved performance compared to the first quarter of fiscal  as anticipated wet shave segment profit decreased nearly  driven by the volume decline in mens partially offset by pricing and lower promotional and ap spending turning to the category we did see a material slowdown across all measures within the quarter as measured by nielsen the us manual shave category was down over  in the latest week data with declines in mens systems womens systems and disposables mens manual shave was down over  when factoring in nonmeasured channels we believe the us mens category was down around  driven by online growth with the overall razors and blades category down about  from a share perspective versus a year ago we were up slightly globally and our us share was up  basis points in manual shave driven by share gains in mens womens and disposables this increase marks the eighth consecutive quarter of share gains in the us manual shave sun and skin care net sales increased nearly  including the positive impact of the bulldog acquisition organic net sales increased over  in the quarter driven by volume growth in north america and international growth in north america up over  on an organic basis was largely volume based due to the timing of shipments by quarter versus a year ago and also benefited from new product distribution and improved baselines these improvements were partially offset by the impact of exiting private label this year which was a drag of about  million this quarter with an estimated impact of  million for the full year international also delivered doubledigit organic growth driven by improved consumption and new distribution in emea and latin america segment profit increased  million driven primarily by higher volumes and improved costs as we benefited from restructuring cost improvement projects within the us sun care category consumption was down over  in the quarter keep in mind that second quarter consumption is typically only  of the full year category sales our us market share improved in the quarter in both banana boat and hawaiian tropic brands just a quick update on bulldog mens grooming product line we remain pleased with the financial and market share results in the quarter as well as commercial plans the team has put in place for the balance of the year integration is progressing well with back office activities underway and international expansion plans in development turning to feminine care organic net sales decreased  million or  sport branded pad and liner net sales were down approximately  million as expected due to distribution losses which are expected to continue through the balance of the year in addition sales decreased across tampons pads and liners driven by heightened competitive promotional level as well as category softness and reductions in trade inventory levels the volume declines were partially offset by lower promotional spend in the quarter versus higher support levels a year ago behind sport pads and liners feminine care segment profit decrease  million driven by lower volumes increased product cost related to the transition of manufacturing from montreal to dover delaware and increased transactional currency impacts overall the feminine care category was down slightly by  basis points but down  in tampons and  in liners our market share declined  points we recently announced our launches for compact tampons  smaller than full size which makes it the most compact tampon on the market this launch will fuel continued growth of sport tampons as we tap into the growing compact segment of the category having said that we anticipate heightened competitive promotional and product launch activity and continued baseline decreases in gentle glide tampons and pads and liners so we now expect net sales to trend similar to yeartodate trends for the remainder of the year from a segment profit perspective the transition startup costs for pads and liners are anticipated to continue through the third quarter finally in our all other segment which is primarily infant care organic sales increased  driven by strong growth in our diaper genie and pet care businesses this quarter this was the sixth consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth in our diaper genie business which has been a critical driver in stabilizing our infant care top line turning to our full year outlook we are revising our outlook for organic net sales to flat for the year down from our previous outlook of a low single digit – lowsingledigit increase this outlook reflects additional declines in feminine care and north america wet shave due to category softness and heightened competitive intensity and reflects growth in international wet shave in the back half of the year driven by several initiatives including the benefit of price increases new product launches as well as ongoing growth in emerging markets we also continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and currency volatility and are not immune to the impacts of these but based on our results through the first half current spot exchange rates and what we know today were maintaining our previously stated outlook for adjusted eps we will continue to take a balanced approach to investment in the business for a long term and margin expansion in the year for the full fiscal year  we estimate organic sales to be flat and we now estimate that reported net sales will be down approximately  this includes an estimated  basis point headwind from currency and estimated  basis point benefit from the bulldog acquisition our gaap eps outlook is now in the range of  to  and our adjusted eps remains in the range of  to  adjusted operating income margin is anticipated to expand by  basis points the effective tax rate for the fiscal year is now estimated to be in the range of  to  the full year estimate for restructuringrelated cost is now  million to  million reflecting an estimated noncash charge related to the disposition of real estate we continue to expect incremental restructuring savings of  million to  million in  and additional  million to  million in  and  the feminine care production move to our dover plant is now expected to be complete by the end of the third fiscal quarter and we expect to be fully out of the montreal site before the close of our fiscal year let me wrap up by addressing our zerobased spend initiative the project continues to progress well and we are moving into our first category level zerobased budgeting process in addition all  of the categories we have identified for this initiative are moving forward with implementation of savings projects twoyear savings goals have been established by category and we are putting the tools in place to make the savings sustainable including enhanced visibility reporting and detailed savings tracking some of the key savings initiatives include advertising agency fee reductions with tighter control and monitoring of global spend travel policy changes reductions in facilities and waste costs streamlining of market research across all geographies optimizing sales support costs in all classes of trade and assessing legal and insurance costs through the first half of the fiscal year net savings have been roughly  million and we expect to realize higher savings in the next two quarters as the projects ramp up we continue to estimate we can deliver  million to  million in net savings over the next two years including an estimate of  million to  million in savings for fiscal  thank you and with that well open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session our first question comes from nik modi with rbc capital markets please go ahead nik modi  rbc capital markets llc yeah thank you good morning everyone just a couple questions on the wet shave business so i found it interesting that you guys actually got pricing in the quarter and still gained share at the same time to what had the worst price mix performance i think since our model goes back to  that i can remember and im just trying to see if you can reconcile that i mean did you see any impact because i know they were highly promotional during the quarter is that part of your guidance already and then the second followup to that was just on the private label side youve had some good success with the threeblade just curious on how thats going and are you going to be expanding that to other retailers david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah thanks nik maybe just to begin with the private label question yeah were actually right now rolling that out internationally the fits proposition so were rolling that out around the world primarily in developed markets in terms of the price mix weve been gaining share for the last eight quarters we gained share in the last four quarters despite promotions from competition – promotional rates that are up in the – in unprecedented territory for the last four quarters so this is just kind of more of the same sandy i dont know if you have any other color to add sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co yeah so we did get some pricing in the quarter as we started price increase in japan so some of that started this quarter and we also had lower promotional spend predominantly related to higher levels a year ago as we were supporting the new nextgen hydro launch in the us so i would say those are the two main factors david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah nik modi  rbc capital markets llc great and then just if i can slip in one more on shave clubs i mean some of the intel weve been picking up is that they are starting to kind of subside in terms of the growth rate as repeat rates arent matching up to trial rates and im just curious on if youve observed – what youve observed through your data david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah yeah were actually seeing similar trends now the data that we see has to be taken with a caveat but weve seen them slow down sequentially over the last four quarters or five quarters and in fact this last quarter the data that we have says they were actually down sequentially so we see similar trends chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you nik nik modi  rbc capital markets llc thank you chris gough  edgewell personal care co thanks nik operator next question please operator our next question comes from stephen powers with ubs please go ahead stephen r powers  ubs securities llc great thanks first on sun care on the us side can you just clarify how much of that shipment timing was a catchup from the prior quarter versus a pullforward from q and then internationally the distribution gains that you made this quarter is – do you think that level is sustainable and just really how do you size for the distribution opportunity david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah for the pullin and pullout we see a large portion of the us growth being timing whether it be from q in or q going into q we see the pullforward from the q being roughly  million to  million of the growth internationally we see continued growth both driven by consumption and a philosophy where were handled as well as increased distribution in either new countries or new customers so we see international growth continuing through the year and into   stephen r powers  ubs securities llc okay great and then back to niks question on us wet shave can you talk a little bit more about what you are or arent seeing now that were – now that gillettes price pack architecture change begun to flow into the market i know that previously youd said you really werent expecting much in the way of kind of net change post this implementation just given the promotional rates that were running coming into it but im curious if that view has evolved at all now that were – now that its begun to flow into the market david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah it is early days still so we see a lot – theres a lot that needs to settle down so im not sure that we have a very definitive answer to that maybe to break it down theres kind of three facets to their program one was they – that they went to what we call oneups which are packages that have the handle plus one cartridge rather than the normal two so theyve downsized and they also launched some twopack refills those are measures theyve done in the past and frankly didnt work or didnt help the category were seeing those reverse pretty quickly and i think the customers will actually move away from those pretty quick so that should go away secondly in the majority of the cases what were seeing are promotion levels pricing – rollback levels that are now being made permanent there again we dont see that as a real incremental impact to us there is a third category that may be emerging in – with some brands where they – where the price cuts may be deeper than the promoted prices that weve been seeing so there may be some incrementality there i think its too early to really gauge that but well monitor the situation stephen r powers  ubs securities llc thank you chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you steve operator next question please operator our next question comes from wendy nicholson with citi please go ahead wendy c nicholson  citigroup global markets inc hi two questions just first of all on the tmall launch can you talk just – i know its early days but how your product is priced on how much promotion youre doing and sort of how big are your expectations for that business in terms of how quickly do you think it will ramp up and then second of all just kind of higher level on the fem care business i know there are a lot of things affecting the results in the quarter but the conversation about category weakness surprises me because that strikes me as a category where you probably dont have a huge amount of inventory at home so there shouldnt be a lot of destocking people use it kind of regularly there are no trends like people arent shaving or casual fridays or whatever that should be affecting the category so could you just offer your take on what is leading to underlying volume weakness in a category like fem care thanks david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah yeah thank you on the fem care question we dont have any real deep insight there im sort of chalking out the fact that almost every category within cpg land was – it was softer during this quarter and where weve been seeing growth in the  to   it was actually down for the quarter and i kind of chalk it up to the same trends that we see in other cpg categories so i see it coming back in terms of china its early days with tmall and theres a lot of work you have to do but were up running learning gaining insights and in china overall we see theres a pretty large opportunity particularly for premium products through digital channels we have around an eight share and our product lines are – have been skewed to the low end and were very underindexed to a digital so we see this as a great way to expand both penetration in the marketplace to consumers also to augment our product line over time so we see this as a pretty sizable opportunity but china as a rule were not going to get too far ahead of ourselves from an investment point of view i think as we grow well continue to invest wendy c nicholson  citigroup global markets inc got it and just back on the fem care side do you see any disproportionate shift in that category specifically from traditional retail to online channels david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co no thats certainly growing but not – but its not – i dont think that it overindexes at all wendy c nicholson  citigroup global markets inc got it terrific thank you so much david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co thank you chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you wendy operator next question please operator our next question comes from ali dibadj with bernstein please go ahead ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey guys couple things one is still on wet shave it certainly seems like your competitor is and gillette is doing a lot of – excuse me – a lot of activity theyre changing pack sizes theyre changing price points theyre promoting more and it doesnt really seem to be so far playing out even in the nielsen data today looks like you guys are still maintaining share in fact gaining share in disposables it doesnt seem like you guys are doing much which i guess is a testament to your brand and to your product but do you anticipate doing anything in reaction because theres a lot of activity going on from them and not a lot of activity going on from you guys thats my first question number two is just on sga still seems very high i understand that there are some investments here but we havent seen anything from zbs flow through it sounds like sandy from your comments its going to come through the next few quarters but all we do see is lower ad spend maybe higher restructuring charges but not higher savings as well so im just trying to understand about the direction from a cost savings perspective what we should expect david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co maybe ill begin with the competitive question and then ill hand over to sandy i think were doing a fair amount from an innovation point of view and a brand marketing point of view and i think thats helping baseline shares well continue to promote as we see kind of complements our baseline business in terms of reacting to competition were going to monitor it but we prefer to build the business through innovation and its worked for the last eight quarters and well keep with our game plan but well monitor them sandy on the zbs question sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co right so we did have higher sga this quarter and again largely due to investments in some of our growth initiatives including china ecommerce and the program management costs behind zbs as we move into the second half of the year we do expect to see better zbs savings flow through and fewer costs netting those savings down so we do anticipate well see some improvement in the back half and i will say that we mentioned we did have some net savings in the quarter some of thats sga but we also had some part of that that impacted ap as well so some of our agency costreduction initiatives were beginning to impact ap as well this quarter ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay if i could just throw one last one in just in terms of your share buyback discipline we havent seen much of it and certainly your cash flows right now maybe dont allow it quite as much but how should we think about your buyback discipline and your view obviously on where the stock is right now relative to that thanks david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah as weve said one of our value drivers is to convert operating profit and to grow cash and our priority is then of use of cash is first to put it back into the business to fuel growth opportunities and the cost takeout the second priority would be opportunistic disciplined ma and then the third would actually be buybacks and those remain our priorities on a shorterterm basis we look to balance capital allocation decisions like share repurchase against investment in the business leverage ratios and available liquidity and thats what we continue to do chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you ali operator next question please operator our next question comes from olivia tong with bank of america please go ahead olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch thanks i was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on your outlook for operating margin expansion thats  basis points given that since you last flashed that  guidance gillette obviously announced its plans and youve announced your directtoconsumer initiative maybe your directtoconsumer initiative was already factored into your outlook but your savings target havent changed so can you talk about other offsets or are your spending plans unchanged versus where you originally issued that outlook thanks sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co yeah so we do continue to target our operating margin to expand about  basis points certainly the components of that change and move a little bit as we go through the year but overall they are going to be driven by the zbs savings initiatives we talked about some of our productivity initiatives within cost of sales and gross margin as well as some of our ongoing pricing and promotional spending plans so those are probably the most key components of that expansion olivia tong  bank of america merrill lynch got it and then i guess two clarifications and then a followup first why – i guess why shouldnt we expect you to have at least allocate a bit more spending or give yourself a little bit more flexibility in terms of the either advertising promotion anything else to given sort of the unknowns in the second half and then followingup on that can you provide any additional color on your directtoconsumer plans david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co sure i think weve – were pretty comfortable right now based on what we see and what we know with our marketing plans for the balance of the year those arent – generally those arent things that you want to change within two months three months four months you want to work with your customers and make sure that its planful and its productive from a category point of view so generally were actually comfortable with our plans now well certainly monitor whats going on and we build contingencies and all that kind of thing but right now were actually pretty comfortable working the plan i forgot what the sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co dtc david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yes dtc weve – its been our observation that in – that at cpg companies and brands that merely replicate their brickandmortar approach and put it online they have not fared very well for the effort and the bother weve been working to come up with a proposition thats more unique thats differentiated and its taken some time to do so but we think that were getting pretty ready to be able to launch that in the us and i see us learning from that building that out and then rolling that out in other markets and then maybe replicating it with a different brand so well see we will learn from it and roll it out chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you olivia operator next question please operator our next question comes from jason english with goldman sachs please go ahead jason english  goldman sachs  co hey guys thanks for slotting me in here appreciate it i want to come back – i guess lets come back to us wet shave mens wet shave because its obviously a topic du jour right now the comments – its kind of steady as she goes yeah its been tough but not a whole lot is changing obviously a little incongruent with pgs rhetoric and a little incongruent with the data too particularly if we look at systems right now and theres a lot of noise in the nielsen data but when we do it shows some pretty aggressive sequential pricing actions that you guys may have taken here with prices sort of latest  – down almost  from the  weeks kind of where we wrapped up  can you give us some more on whats going on there is this timing related is it mix related or are you also sort of taking corrective actions on your price points in systems david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co no thatd be – from our side thatd be timing of customer programs promotions that kind of thing so theres not a systematic change i know of several programs that are underway right now that probably werent a year ago but theres – overall theres not a systematic change that said well monitor the situation and change if needed jason english  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful and one more followup also on the category but aggregate us growth correct me if i heard it wrong but i think you said mens manual shave down  and track data down  when you incorporate online and all the unmeasured channels the  basis point spread is big its a lot bigger than when you guys gave your analyst day and i think you highlighted around a basispoint spread so it suggests that online has accelerated rapidly is far far bigger than it was at this point in time yet youre saying things like dtc are actually slowing so how do we foot all that and can you give us your best sense of what online share of the category is today and what its growth rate is david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co okay sure i think this quarter dtc really – it was up and unmeasured is about  of the market and was up we estimate about  which is lower than its been in other quarters but the brickandmortar market was really down when you look at mens for example the overall trend has been – for measured now  units have been down over last year or so by about  there – this last quarter they were down about another point id sort of say thats similar to other cpg categories where it was just a soft quarter but then there was a gap but revenue was down six points or seven points more than that and i think that reflects competitive promotion levels also weve had high although pretty flat versus year ago so i think that that value gap really reflects competitive promotion in the market and thats how id analyze it jason english  goldman sachs  co okay thank you ill pass it on chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you jason operator next question please operator our next question comes from faiza alwy with deutsche bank please go ahead faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc yes hi good morning so i just wanted to check on your gross margin outlook for the year has that changed at all and then are you  just back to the wet shave category  what is your view on the category outlook i know that previously you had mentioned that the category should increase  to  and you expect to grow in line with the category so clearly it softened so if you have any updated views on the category that would be helpful thanks david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co okay so maybe sandy would you want to comment on the gross margin sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co yeah so on gross margin for the year were really focusing on driving our operating margin expansion at  basis points and so really within that were maintaining some flexibility within gross margin sga and ap and not really putting out specific targets given that it could really vary depending on our topline trends the level of investment back into the business and the competitive environment so overall were really really more focused on the operating margin expansion and working all levers that we have to ensure that we meet that david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co and then on the category when you look globally we were looking at kind of low single digits call it  or so and i think that that softened primarily usdriven also a few european markets that softened from a trend point of view and right now at least through the fiscal year we see that continuing so weve seen global market more like flat and we dont see that changing for the next few quarters faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc and just to follow up on that so do you expect to maintain shares so do you expect your organic growth to be roughly flat also david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yes maybe up a little bit weve – our track record and our algorithm looks to modestly grow share and we think that we can continue to do that internationally and in the us in the womens and in disposable faiza alwy  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you faiza operator next question please operator the next question comes from kate grafstein with barclays please go ahead katie grafstein  barclays capital inc thanks i just wanted to ask a question on fem care margins so i thought that by moving to the new manufacturing facility this would improve margins over time and i just wanted to ask are transition issues greater than you had expected and over time whats the appropriate margin structure for this business once issues are worked through thanks david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah ill actually begin then ill ask sandy to give some color but yeah this has been a pretty mammoth transition i think the team is working really hard but this is a particularly tough quarter for us as were winding down the montreal plant but were still there and were on the ramp up learning curve in the dover plant so were kind of getting the worst of both worlds and i characterize this as probably the toughest quarter from a transition point of view i think its taken about a quarter longer than we thought i think were making progress and i expect that were running better and that the cost position gets better from here on sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co yeah so the only additional color id say is we do anticipate some additional transition costs through q and then with improvements beginning in q and then into  i think we would expect to be able to see low teens – be able to return to lowteen margin structure sometime within fiscal year  into  chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you kate operator next question please operator our next question comes from bill chappell with suntrust please go ahead william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks good morning just – and maybe i missed it kind of thoughts on fem care over the next two quarters three quarters is there expectations for things to improve as a category and kind of what have you seen in april as weve continued to move into the next quarter david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co i cant really comment about april i havent really seen that data but i think we do think that the category will come back to modest growth i think it was a little bit of an anomaly i dont know it will be – if it will come back next quarter or the one after that but i think that it should return to growth and then were going to focus on really stabilizing sales going into  through a focus on the category management innovation and the marketing fundamentals but the trump goal as weve said is to increase profitability and as we talked about trying to consolidating operations in the dover plant and then running better down there william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and then can you just remind me on the dover plant i mean i remember we started the year with the expectation or maybe we started that it will be closed a lot sooner and then you would recognize the benefits this year so could you just remind me kind of what the savings are and i assume that would all be reflected in fiscal  david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co yeah i think were running about a quarter or so behind and we thought that we would have it done this fiscal and i think that it may bleed into next year by a quarter sandy do you have the savings sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co yeah so we are seeing some savings this year on the fem care part of it obviously weve got other savings in restructuring right that were tracking against this year including our wet shave footprints move and some of our sun care insourcing activities that have been doing well but were also seeing some savings just as we ramp down the montreal production site its just the majority of them well start to see in q and then into  and  chris gough  edgewell personal care co thank you bill operator next question please operator our next question comes from kevin grundy with jefferies please go ahead kevin grundy  jefferies llc thanks good morning guys question on the growth opportunities that were outlined in your press release this morning so specifically international expansion sun and skin care and ecommerce so a few questions related to that david perhaps you can talk about the role of organic investment versus ma which businesses and regions youre most focused on for international expansion you mentioned china earlier in the call and then theres been some discussions sandy around margin implications so understanding you guys are comfortable with the  basis points for this year and in addition you guys also called out the  basis points just for your longterm algorithm so my question on the margin component is not so much  but looking out beyond  is that still the right margin algorithm for the company thanks david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co thank you from an investment point of view i mean certainly china but i mean generally international and the emerging markets in asia and in latam are our focuses for continued growth sandra j sheldon  edgewell personal care co yeah so on the margin implications i guess sort of over the medium to long term we do still see that as the right metric for us to include in our algorithm and some of the drivers of that remain the same as they have always been which is continuous improvement in our – against our cost base both in a production and a nonproduction perspective ongoing work on marketing mix ongoing work on trade promotion efficiency ongoing zerobased budgeting and spending initiatives and focus so we see several paths to continuing to improve our operating profit margin even with some of these and i presume your question suggests that some of the opportunities are lower margin and youre right some of them are but we really do see the ability to improve against our cost base and improve against even some of our spending categories as well to ensure theyre as optimal and productive as possible kevin grundy  jefferies llc okay david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co and i might jump back in because i didnt answer your question about ma and we actually view that as opportunistic and were looking at the top of the funnel with several targets at any given time i guess we have a little bit of a bias internationally just because of the cash that were holding there but we generally look at targets anywhere and so were active there looking mainly in the skin care the mens grooming categories adjacency that are pretty close to where were at with shave or sun and skin kevin grundy  jefferies llc okay thanks and then quick followup just on the top line algorithms so david its now flattish relative to the longterm algorithm of the  to  so for the foreseeable future its sort of flat top line for the entire company is that correct david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co no no we think given innovation that were looking at over the next several years plus the growth opportunities that we see the full portfolio et cetera we think that we have line of sight to the  to  algorithm over the mediumterm kevin grundy  jefferies llc very good thank you and good luck david p hatfield  edgewell personal care co thank you kevin operator next question please operator at this time im showing no further questions so i would like to turn the conference back to david hatfield
