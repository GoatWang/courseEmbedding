 richardson pc dallas tx argued for defendantscrossappellants also represented by ricardo bonilla neil j mcnabnay john a dragseth minneapolis mn this case returns to us from the united states district court for the eastern district of texas district court where parallel networks llc parallel networks asserted us patent no   patent against more than  defendants for their use of certain applets on their websites over parallel networks opposition the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement for kayak software corp dba kayakcom kayak orbitz llc orbitz worldwide inc orbitz worldwide llc orbitz away llc collectively orbitz and wolverine world wide inc wolverine because their accused applets did not meet the “executable applet” claim limitation in the  patent shoebuycom llc shoebuy also moved for summary judgment of noninfringement in response parallel networks proposed that it would dismiss its infringement claim against shoebuy with prejudice if shoebuy agreed to dismiss its invalidity counterclaim with prejudice after the parties failed to reach an agreement the district court dismissed both the infringement claim and invalidity counterclaim with prejudice with the merits resolved all defendants moved for attorneys fees pursuant to  usc §   but the district court denied that motion we agree with the district court in all respects but for its dismissal of shoebuys invalidity counterclaim with prejudice we therefore affirm in part and reverse in partbackgroundbecause we write for the parties familiarity with the facts of this case including all proceedings at the district court is presumed previously we “construed the asserted claims of the  patent to require that the applet be executable or operable when it is generated and before it is first transmitted to the client which means it must include both the particularized data and the functionality” parallel networks llc v abercrombie  fitch co  fd   fed cir  we explained that if “the client needs to ‘obtain’ information in order to execute” the applet then “no ‘executable’ or ‘operable’ applet is generated and ․ transferred from the server to the client as the patent requires” id at given our construction and understanding of the  patent the district court here granted summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of kayak orbitz and wolverine because parallel networks admitted that these defendants accused applets once they reached the client relied on resources that were “transmitted separately” external resources for the applet to be executable ja at  the accused applets therefore were not executable applets as required by the patent claimsas to kayak the district court had to resolve whether kayaks accused applet in fact relied on external resources to be executable at the client id at – in opposing kayaks motion for summary judgment of noninfringement parallel networks explained through its expert that kayaks accused applet relied on external resources to be executable see id but later in a surreply brief parallel networks changed its position and argued again through its expert that the accused applet did not rely on external resources to be executable see id the district court rejected parallel networks attempt to backtrack from its earlier explanation as to how kayaks accused applet is executable see idparallel networks undertook a different strategy with shoebuy instead of opposing shoebuys summary judgment motion of noninfringement parallel networks offered to dismiss its infringement claim with prejudice provided that shoebuy did the same for its invalidity counterclaim see id at   n the parties could not reach an agreement about dismissal as they came to an impasse over the particulars of a covenant not to sue on the  patent covenant the district court ultimately dismissed both the infringement claim and the invalidity counterclaim with prejudice relying on the purported existence of a covenant see id at – shoebuy sought reconsideration to change the dismissal of its invalidity counterclaim to one without prejudice contending that the district court erroneously found that there was a covenant see id at – the district court declined to reconsider its decision see id at finally all of these defendants moved for attorneys fees under §  arguing that the case was exceptional because parallel networks pursued an infringement theory against these defendants that was foreclosed by our prior opinion in this case and because parallel networks litigated the case unreasonably by merely seeking to force settlements with no intention of testing the merits of its case see id at – the district court denied the motion finding nothing exceptional about either parallel networks infringement theory or its litigation strategy see idparallel networks appeals the district courts entry of summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of kayak orbitz and wolverine as well as the district courts refusal to permit parallel networks to amend its description of how kayaks accused applet is executable all defendants crossappeal the district courts denial of attorneys fees pursuant to  usc §  shoebuy crossappeals the district courts dismissal of its invalidity counterclaim with prejudice we have jurisdiction under  usc § a discussiona appealwe review a grant of summary judgment in accordance with the law of the regional circuit here the fifth circuit ineos usa llc v berry plastics corp  fd   fed cir  the fifth circuit reviews de novo a district courts grant of summary judgment id citing triple tee golf inc v nike inc  fd   th cir as an initial matter the district court correctly prohibited parallel networks from revising its explanation of how kayaks accused applet is executable in the midst of summary judgment briefing parallel networks cannot assert that kayaks accused applet relies on external resources to be executable while opposing kayaks summary judgment motion and then assert to the contrary that it does not in the surreply without justification sws erectors inc v infax inc  fd   th cir  “it is well settled that this court does not allow a party to defeat a motion for summary judgment using an affidavit that impeaches without explanation sworn testimony” citations and footnote omitted see also parallel networks  fd at  ipse dixit testimony from parallel networks expert was insufficient to preclude summary judgment no adequate justification was ever provided and so there was no genuine issue of material fact that kayaks accused applet relies on external resources compare ja at – with id at –the district court also correctly held that the accused applets of kayak orbitz and wolverine could not infringe the  patent because the accused applets are not executable once they are transmitted from a server to a client device the executable applet claimed in the patent “cannot be finalized at the client whether by an ‘external program’ a ‘web server application’ or some other mechanism” parallel networks  fd at  see also id at  “the fact that the client needs to ‘obtain’ information in order to execute however confirms that no ‘executable’ or ‘operable’ applet is generated and then transferred from the server to the client as the patent requires” as parallel networks admitted the accused applets rely on external resources to be executable after they are transmitted to the client which necessarily means that they are not executable applets as claimed in the patent see id at  “the fact that the client needs to ‘obtain’ information in order to execute however confirms that no ‘executable’ or ‘operable’ applet is generated and then transferred from the server to the client as the patent requires”according to parallel networks the district court erred in entering summary judgment because we made clear in our earlier decision that “whether an applet is ‘executable’ is determined by looking at how the applet performs on an intended client device” appellant br at  this argument misunderstands our earlier decision as we “construed the asserted claims of the  patent to require that the applet be executable or operable when it is generated and before it is first transmitted to the client which means it must include both the particularized data and the functionality” parallel networks  fd at  emphasis addedin sum the district court correctly entered summary judgment of noninfringement in favor of kayak orbitz and wolverineb crossappeal attorneys fees under  usc § a district court may award attorneys fees to prevailing parties in an exceptional case see  usc §  “an ‘exceptional’ case is simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a partys litigating position considering both the governing law and the facts of the case or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated” octane fitness llc v icon health  fitness inc  us   s ct    the “district court  may determine whether a case is ‘exceptional’ in the casebycase exercise of its discretion considering the totality of the circumstances” id “a ‘nonexclusive’ list of ‘factors ” to consider include “frivolousness motivation objective unreasonableness both in the factual and legal components of the case and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence” id at   n quoting fogerty v fantasy inc  us   n  considering the degree of deference we give to district courts on this matter we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by not deeming the case exceptional the defendants first contend that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that parallel networks had a plausible infringement theory because their applets were no different than those accused applets we previously held were noninfringing but that is not quite so the accused applets we examined in our earlier decision were “missing at least one portion of the functional code or data when the applet was transferred to the client” and used “a link” as a placeholder to retrieve the missing portion parallel networks  fd at  we explained that the  patent does not contemplate such applets see id at  explaining that the  patent “does not describe ․ a scenario in which in response to a request only part of the applet is generated with a placeholder for the rest and is transmitted to the client which then tries to execute it and finding it nonexecutable and inoperable follows a link back over the network to retrieve the additional data andor functionality that is needed for the applet to run” emphasis added the defendants however do not dispute that their accused applets do not contain a “link” for retrieval of additional data andor functionality after transmission to the client to be executable thus some daylight existed between the accused applets from our earlier decision and the accused applets herethe defendants also contend that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that parallel networks did not litigate the case unreasonably because parallel networks primarily instituted the case to extract nuisance value settlements rather than to litigate the merits they assert that the district court had at one point agreed with that assessment we disagree there is no evidence that parallel networks sought to avoid litigating the merits or that the district court had ever opined that parallel networks was seeking nuisance value settlements see ja at  judge davis “one thing i am not interested in encouraging in this court is the suing of a great number of defendants for basically a shakedowncostofdefensetype settlement i am not saying that is going on in this case” emphasis added dismissal of invalidity counterclaimin deciding the propriety of a dismissal of a counterclaim with or without prejudice we apply the law of the regional circuit here the fifth circuit see univ of pittsburgh v varian med sys inc  fd   fed cir  citing hr techs inc v astechnologies inc  fd   fed cir  the fifth circuit reviews a district courts dismissal of a counterclaim with prejudice for an abuse of discretion see eg hyde v hoffmannla roche inc  fd   th cir  elbaor v tripath imaging inc  fd  – th cir shoebuy argues that the district court abused its discretion because it dismissed the invalidity counterclaim with prejudice on the mistaken premise that parallel networks and shoebuy had entered a covenant we agree with shoebuy that the dismissal of the counterclaim should be without prejudice the district courts finding that these particular parties agreed to a covenant was clearly erroneous especially given that parallel networks does not insist that such a covenant exists we therefore reverse the dismissal of shoebuys invalidity counterclaim with prejudice on this groundconclusionwe have considered the parties remaining arguments in support of the relief they request on appeal but find them unpersuasive for the foregoing reasons we affirm in part and reverse in partaffirmed in part and reversed in partcostsno costsfootnotes   judge leonard e davis initially presided over the case but left the judiciary
