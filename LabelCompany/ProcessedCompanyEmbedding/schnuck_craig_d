stroud of the postdispatch read preview article excerpt as youngsters doris schnucks boys fought so much that she wondered if theyd survive childhood it was just roughhousing protested todd schnuck the youngest son but it was rough enough to punch a hole in the wall after one boy threw a hipcheck at another one day as they were running up the stairs at the schnuck family home he admitted doris schnuck neednt have worried family harmony is almost a mantra with the six schnucks siblings  five brothers and a sister we put as much time into family harmony as into the business mark schnuck said

nancy a diemer  community affairs director building on foundations laid by their father the late donald o schnuck and their uncle the late edward j schnuck the thirdgeneration schnucks have led the company to prominence in the st louis market and beyond even before it bought national super markets last year schnucks was one of a couple places youd stop in the country to look at new developments in the supermarket industry said larry delsanto a longtime family friend who is chairman and chief executive of vons cos a supermarket chain in arcadia calif schnucks has been a pioneer in category management  the art of managing merchandise assortments to maximize profit and sales the schnuck family and other managers are active on industry committees to speed the movement of products from manufacturers to market and to ease the flow of information between stores and suppliers the national merger was a bold stroke that thrust schnucks and the family into the spotlight  a position the family viewed with a mixture of pride and apprehension for schnucks the buyout was the best opportunity to boost its growth beyond the piecemeal pace of building new stores one or two at a time craig schnuck said for the rest of st louis the deal came as a shock  and a threat to the competitive balance among food stores here national employees worried about their jobs city shoppers wondered how schnucks would serve innercity areas where it had limited experience the federal trade commission reviewed the deal for six months before it was convinced that competition from discount stores drugstores and convenience stores would keep schnucks from dominating the market in the end the government allowed schnucks to buy the 5 national stores but only if it sold  of them and six schnucks stores schnucks closed five stores when it completed the deal in june 5 former national managers bought  stores and reopened them as the new national wild oats markets a natural foods supermarket chain from boulder colo bought the last store the government had ordered schnucks to sell the schnucks say they think the st louis market is as competitive as ever competition from walmart and other types of stores remains keen and restaurants are cutting into supermarkets sales schnucks now has 0 stores in st louis and  in seven other cities the company wont give specific numbers but doesnt dispute published sales estimates of  billion a year schnucks hasnt put the brakes on growth since the national buyout three new stores will open by february and two more are in the works schnucks has proposed new stores at the old mercy high school site in university city and at a shopping center to be built at union boulevard and natural bridge avenue in st louis but schnucks is looking outside st louis for most of its future growth the company is expanding its clusters of stores in kansas city and in central and southern illinois and it will consider acquisitions in other cities scott and
