principal business of terra tech is the integration of best of breed hydroponic equipment with proprietary technology to create sustainable solutions for the cultivation of indoor agriculture we work closely with expert horticulturists engineers and scientists to develop and manufacture advanced proprietary products for the hydroponic industry our products are utilized by horticulture enthusiasts local urban farmers and green house growers we believe that the emerging trend of urban and indoor agriculture has fostered an entrepreneurial push by companies to bring their concept to market many of these companies lack both the intellectual resources and manufacturing capabilities to bring their idea to fruition that is where terra tech is positioned we have the team and the resources to help bring indoor cultivation designs from concept to production our products can be found through specialty retailers throughout the united states in addition to cultivation equipment the company acquired edible garden corp in april of  edible garden cultivates and distributes a line of hydroponic and soil grown produce which is currently distributed to over  retail stores throughout the northeast midwest and florida markets the company began construction of a new acre hydroponic cultivation facility in early  a majority of the capital raised throughout  was utilized to finish the construction of this facility throughout  the company contracted with nb plants to cultivate their line of produce while they were waiting for the completion of their new greenhouse although we produced significantly higher revenue during the year we still experienced significant earlystage higher per unit costs inefficiencies during the production ramp from april to december as a result of lower fixed cost absorption cultivation inefficiencies associated with the initial production ramp and higher logistics costs as our supply chain processes continued to mature marketing and distribution agreements on may   edible garden corp a nevada corporation and whollyowned subsidiary of terra tech corp a nevada corporation the company entered into a letter agreement with grorite inc a new jersey

vandevrede all of whom are affiliates of the company additionally ken vandevrede mike vandevrede steve vandevrede are all directors of the company management opportunities challenges and risks our principal focus in  was on the construction of the new acre cultivation facility rebranding and designing our new product line and contracted with farms throughout the country to cultivate the edible garden brand under our conditions and standards we successfully commenced the rebranding of our product line and contracting new farms during the second quarter  however during the second half of  our focus switched to accelerating the construction of the new acre facility a significant portion of the companys time resources and energy went into financing and completing the project at the expense of furthering our sales efforts having completed the majority of our new facility in  we expect produce sales to increase significantly in  as compared with  liquidity and capital resources the companys future success is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities and upon additional financing management believes they can raise the appropriate funds needed to support their business plan and develop an operating cash flow positive company results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   total revenues generated for the year ended december   totaled  an increase of  from the year ended december   which totaled  the increase was primarily due to the companys acquisition of edible garden corp in april  and the continued sales expansion of the companys produce line at this stage in the companys development revenues are not yet sufficient to cover ongoing operating expenses gross profits for the year ended december   amounted to  for a  gross margin gross profits decreased  or  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   with an  gross profit margin in  the decrease in gross profits and gross margin is a result of higher revenue from the sale of locally grown hydroponic produce selling general and administrative expenses of  which included  in noncash outlays in the form of restricted stock and warrants issued as part of the units to raise capital the company realized an operating loss of  operating losses for  of  were down  or  as compared to the  operating loss of  the overall decrease of  was due to the impairment of goodwill in  the balance was offset by approximately  from the increase in warrants issued due to the capital raises in  consulting expenses increased  due to more consultants being hired in  in association with the new locally grown hydroponic produce business in  there was a writeoff of obsolete inventory in the amount of  versus zero in  professional fees increased  in  versus  due to the additional filings made to register the companys common stock other income and expense net totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  as compared to  for the year ended december   in  there was a loss from derivatives issued with debt greater than the debt carrying value in the amount of  versus zero in  there was a gain on the fair market valuation of the derivatives in the amount of  versus zero in  interest and financing expense was  in  increased by  from  in  due to the addition debt issued in  the net result for the year ended december   was a loss of  or  per share compared to a loss of  or  per share for the prior year management will continue to make an effort to lower operating expenses and increase revenue the company will continue to invest in further expanding its operations and a comprehensive marketing campaign with the goal of accelerating the education of potential clients and promoting the name and products of the company given the fact that most of the operating expenses are fixed or have quasifixed character management expects them to significantly decrease as a percentage of revenues as revenues increase since our inception we have raised capital through the private sale of preferred stock and debt securities private sales of common stock the companys business operations generally have been financed by debt investments through the sale of  senior secured convertible debentures with accredited investors and equity investments in the common stock of the company by accredited investors during the full year of  the company obtained new debt from the issuance of  senior secured convertible debentures that supplied the funds that were needed to finance operations during the reporting period the stated rate of interest is  while the inputted rate is  when giving effect for the conversion feature such new borrowings resulted in the receipt by the company of  in addition related parties contributed  in exchange for an unsecured nonconvertible note payable all debt investments are current and in good standing at december   we had cash of approximately  and a working capital deficit of  our major cash flows in the year ended december   consisted of cash outflows of  from operations including  of net loss cash outflows of  from investing activities and a net change from financing activities of  which primarily represented the net proceeds received from issuance of debt common stock and warrants we will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements until we are able to raise revenues to a point of positive cash flow we believe our existing and available capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements through the first quarter of  we are evaluating various options to further reduce our cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate as well as options to raise additional funds including loans and sale of common stock liquidity and capital resources since our inception we have raised capital through the private sale of preferred stock and debt securities private sales of common stock at december   we had cash of approximately  and a working capital deficit of  our major cash flows in the year

including loans and sale of common stock offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates fair value of financial instruments the company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis the company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the marketbased risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability such as risks inherent in valuation techniques transfer restrictions and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level   observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level   inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the companys valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of all other financial instruments all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data in accordance with the fair value accounting requirements companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments accounts receivable the company reviews all outstanding accounts receivable for collectability on a quarterly basis an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for any amounts deemed uncollectable the company does not accrue interest receivable on past due accounts receivable as of december   there was a reserve of  against the collection of accounts receivable prepaid inventory prepaid inventory represents deposits made to foreign manufacturers for purchase orders of specific inventory property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is calculated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  years for machinery and equipment leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term repairs and maintenance expenditures which do not extend the useful lives of related assets are expensed as incurred revenue recognition revenue is recognized net of discounts rebates promotional adjustments price adjustments and estimated returns and upon transfer of title and risk to the customer which occurs at shipping fob terms upon shipment the company has no further performance obligations and collection is reasonably assured as the majority of sales are paid for prior to shipping cost of goods sold management decided to change the focus of the business in  to designing manufacturing and selling hydroponic equipment where favorable gross margins are achieved research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred income taxes the company provides for income taxes based on enacted tax law and statutory tax rates at which items of income and expenses are expected to be settled in the companys income tax return certain items of revenue and expense are reported for federal income tax purposes in different periods than for financial reporting purposes thereby resulting in deferred income taxes deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses that are available to offset future taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized the company has incurred net operating losses for financialreporting and taxreporting purposes accordingly for federal and state income tax purposes the benefit for income taxes has been offset entirely by a valuation allowance against the related federal and state deferred tax asset for the twelve months ended december   loss per common share net loss per share in accordance with the provisions of asc  earnings per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period during a loss period the effect of the potential exercise of stock options warrants convertible preferred stock and convertible debt are not considered in the diluted income loss per share calculation since the effect would be antidilutive the results of operations were a net loss for the twelve months ended december   therefore the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding were the same recently issued accounting standards management does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flow mar   c

until his seizure frequency became unbearable fabrizio tried medical cannabis for the first time after  days with no seizures fabrizio took it upon himself to search the scientific literature

recent interview on the tim constantine show  please join us by subscribing today terra tech exposes cyber bully and cyber coward – derek peterson november  november    terratechderekpeterson  leave a comment the marijuana industry has recently become the target of twitter bulling in which pothating cowards specifically one going by the handle laughinpaulryan have been spreading libelous information about members of the cannabis industry to prevent them from doing business “they were repeatedly emailing commissioners giving them false information about our company” said derek peterson with the californiabased terra tech “they claimed the fbi had raided our offices which isn’t true” a recent report by mainstreet indicates that the primary culprit in this debacle has been identified as yearold new jersey resident norman gates who legal experts claim could be in serious trouble for slander “more cyber harassment of companies is happening online today because bullies think they are acting anonymously” said social media attorney ethan wall “what bullies fail to realize is that it’s easy to prove slander on twitter where someone made false statements about a third party by counting the number of tweets and taking screenshots” in an attempt to combat an onslaught of tweets that led the clark county commission to decline production and cultivation permits for terra tech’s nevada operations the company hired a private investigator to find out exactly who was responsible for this sabotage the firm discovered that gates has some affiliations with individuals involved with criminal activity but so far they have not uncovered a motive for damaging the company “he does a lot of harassing people who defend terra tech on twitter” said peterson “when potential investors ‘google’ terra tech they want negative information to appear which deters them from looking further into the company his objective is to impact google rankings for terra tech” peterson says terra tech is in the process of filing a lawsuit which he hopes will finally put an end to gates’ assault of misinformation on the company “we believe norman gates doesn’t have two nickels to rub together” said peterson “we want him to stop sabotaging our company but we also plan to recoup our losses from being declined a dispensary license in nevada and for that we are going after the people who’ve hired gates to execute this campaign of tortious interference” terra tech  trtc  continues to move forward  – derek peterson november  november    terratechderekpeterson  leave a comment terra tech corp
