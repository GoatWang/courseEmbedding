gentle oral rinsewell today i have biotene dry mouth mouthwash for consideration i actually suffer from dry mouth quite frequently so this was a good choice for me to try and review the bottle looks good enough its easy on the eyes and not a bad design at all the product itself is refreshing and doesnt taste bad to me it leaves what can be described as a slimy or wet feeling in your mouth at first but you get used to it i dont mean that in a bad way either it wasnt disgusting or annoying to me it seems to do what its supposed to do and my dentist has even recommended this product in the past i just had not went out and followed his recommendation now the only negative is the  hours its supposed to last id say it lasts about  this is what kept me from awarding  stars in my review id have even went  if i could because its important to live up to your advertised promise maybe its different in each individual and varying degrees of dry mouth but for me personally it lasted half the advertised time it does work though and like previously stated did not taste bad or overwhelmingly like medicine id recommend it but warn people they may need to use it more often than it stateswas
