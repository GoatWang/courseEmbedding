surviving entity its name will be changed to concurrent computer and james k sims concurrents president and chief executive will be chairman president and chief executive of the new company mr sims who has been president of concurrent since it was spun off by the perkinelmer corporation in november  said the merger presented greater opportunities for increased operating efficiency and a broader
