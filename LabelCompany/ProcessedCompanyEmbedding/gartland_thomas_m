against appellant thomas gartland a former employee for breach of a noncompete agreement and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information the trial court issued a temporary injunction against gartland gartland appeals from this order arguing the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction we reverse and remand facts appellant thomas gartland began working for respondent ecolab inc ecolab on october   as a territory manager in training on october   he signed a noncompete agreement the pertinent provision of the agreement states for a period of one  year immediately following the termination of his employment with the company the employee will not service sell solicit the sale of or accept orders for any competing products to any customer of the company with whom the employee did business or whose accounts was supervised by or assigned to the employee or with regard to which the employee received commissions or other compensation at any time during the twelve  month period immediately preceding the termination of his employment during said one year following termination the employee also will not assist any competing firm to engage in the activities prohibited by the foregoing sentence a competing firm means any person or organization including one owned in whole or in party by the employee which is engaged in the development production use marketing or sale of a competing product a competing product means any product or service which is the same as or similar to and competes with a product or service of the company which was part of the product or service line handled by the employee or persons supervised by the employee during his last two  years of employment by the company the agreement also contains a confidentiality provision under which gartland agreed not to disclose confidential information acquired while at ecolab although ecolab had a policy of requiring upperlevel management to sign a more restrictive noncompete agreement when promoted ecolab did not require gartland to sign any other agreement than the one at issue here gartland first worked in ecolabs institutional division which manufactures and sells soap and detergent products to various institutions he advanced to the position of district manager then assistant vice president of national accounts on january   gartland moved laterally to the pest elimination division which provides extermination products and services to restaurants hotels and motels in january  gartland was promoted to vice president of national accounts for the pest elimination division and in  to vice president corporate accounts pest elimination for north america he remained with the pest elimination division until he resigned in november  the pest elimination and institutional divisions of ecolab are operated as separate organizations with separate financial structures sales and service organizations and management teams ecolab encourages cooperative sales efforts between its divisions however through a circle the customer concept the goal of this strategy is to have ecolab service all of a customers needs that can be met by ecolabs different divisions gartland utilized ecolabs circle the customer strategy in building business for the pest elimination division he participated in joint sales calls and joint proposals made to institutional customers as well as market strategy planning with institutional personnel he required the employees he supervised to do likewise in addition he promoted institutional product sales by providing introductions for institutional sales personnel with pest elimination customers in november  gartland accepted a position with diversey corp a major competitor of ecolabs institutional division when ecolab learned gartland had solicited business for diversey from ecolabs institutional customers it notified gartland and diversey by letter dated january   that it considered his actions a breach of the noncompete agreement diversey who interpreted the noncompete agreement as preventing gartland from competing with ecolabs pest elimination division only responded by stating that gartland would not refrain from soliciting ecolabs institutional customers ecolab filed this action and moved for a temporary injunction after a hearing the trial court issued the injunction restraining gartland from contacting or accepting orders for institutional sales products and services from all former customers constituting ecolabs institutional corporate sales accounts whom gartland contacted and had access to in accordance with employment agreement the trial court found that even though gartland worked for the pest elimination division he had handled institutional products through his extensive participation in the circle the customer concept it also found ecolab had proved a threat of irreparable harm through the potential for wrongful disclosure of confidential institutional information to which gartland had had access through his participation in the circle the customer program gartland requested and this court granted an expedited appeal issue did the district court err in its interpretation of the noncompete agreement and abuse its discretion by granting the temporary injunction analysis a temporary injunction is an extraordinary equitable remedy that preserves the status quo pending a trial on the merits central lakes educ assn v independent sch dist no   nwd   minnapp review denied minn nov   a party seeking a temporary injunction

in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below north star state bank v north star bank minnesota  nwd   minnapp  review denied minnapr   when reviewing a trial courts decision to issue a

merits  public policies expressed in statutes and  the administrative burdens in supervising and enforcing the decree sanborn mfg co v currie  nwd   minnapp the factor of greatest concern here is ecolabs likelihood of success on the merits the court dislikes and closely scrutinizes noncompete agreements because they partially restrict trade national recruiters v cashman  nwd   minn in order to be enforceable noncompete agreements must be reasonable and supported by consideration see davies  davies agency v davies  nwd   minn discussing policy reasons for these elements gartland argues that the trial court erred when it found that ecolab would likely prove that the noncompete agreement at issue here is enforceable and would preclude him from competing with ecolabs institutional division we agree the noncompete agreement defines a competing product as one similar to and competitive with part of the product or service line handled by the employee this case turns upon whether that phrase applies only to the products sold by the pest elimination division in which gartland worked for the last two years of his ecolab employment or whether that phrase can be applied to the product lines of other divisions with which gartland had significant interaction both parties offer reasonable definitions for handle gartland relying on several insurance law cases urges us to adopt a narrow definition to buy and sell or to deal or trade in see eg olympic ss co v centennial ins co  wnd   pd    adopting similar definition ecolab on the other hand urges a broad definition the trial court extracted from a missouri tax law case state ex rel bell v phillips petroleum co  mo   swd    relying on this case the trial court here found handle meant to control direct to deal with to act upon and to perform some function with regard to to manage or operate in addition to sell buy deal or trade in a contract is ambiguous when its language is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation current technology concepts v irie enter  nwd   minn although it is unclear whether the trial court found the language at issue here ambiguous we note that the question of whether an ambiguity exists is one of law see id because both of the definitions offered by the parties could reasonably be applied to the contract language we conclude that the language is ambiguous when construing an ambiguous contract the court has a duty to give effect to the intent of the parties turner v alpha phi sorority house  nwd   minn midway ctr assocs v midway ctr inc  minn    nwd    the court construes any ambiguities in the contract against the drafting party current technology concepts  nwd at  as the supreme court has stated where a contract is open to two interpretations the one more favorable to the party who did not draft the instrument should be adopted in the absence of a clear showing that a contrary meaning was intended by the parties at the time of its execution wick v murphy  minn    nwd    accord turner  nwd at  beattie v product design  engg  minn    nwd    a court ascertains the parties intent by putting itself in the parties positions at the time they formed the contract and determining what they reasonably meant to accomplish in view of the contract as a whole its plain language and the surrounding circumstances midway ctr assocs  minn at   nwd at  the court may also rely on extrinsic evidence to resolve an ambiguity see turner  nwd at  court consulted various possible definitions to decide meaning of terms at issue the trial court here held that the broader definition of handle was warranted because the court is not convinced by defendants interpretation of the term handle in the context of this case defendants attempt to narrowly construe the language of the noncompete provision undermines the meaning of handle as it applies to sales industry standards especially with regards to positions in upper management corporate sales we conclude that the trial court erred by applying the broader definition first the court was not permitted to base its decision on industry standards because the record shows that the parties presented no evidence of the standard practices of any corporation except ecolab furthermore the evidence pertaining to ecolabs business practices relates to current practices the record is not clear about when ecolab instituted its circle the customer program or whether it anticipated that gartland would have such significant interaction with other ecolab divisions we note that at the time gartland signed the agreement he was a territory manager in training not the senior sales executive he was at his departure this evidence is not helpful in ascertaining what the parties intent was fifteen years ago in  when ecolab and gartland entered into the noncompete agreement the intent of the agreement clearly enough was to prevent ecolabs employees from using the training confidential information and good will developed while at ecolab to compete directly with ecolab that intent is an insufficient basis upon which to infer that ecolab in  intended the noncompete agreement to apply to the present circumstances public policy requires that restrictive covenants be strictly construed and not extended beyond the true intent of the parties naftalin v john wood co  minn    nwd    we note that the language reads the product or service line handled by the employee not any or all lines handled by the employee this language supports a narrow construction furthermore the record contains a different ecolab noncompete agreement with more restrictive language which shows that ecolab recognized its need to protect its investment in situations like the one at issue here and knew how to accomplish that based on the evidence in the record gartland was entitled to the benefit of the rule mandating strict construction of the ambiguity the trial court erred by not construing the agreement narrowly the record shows ecolabs different operating divisions were maintained separately within the corporation with separate product lines management structures and financial operations while working in the pest elimination division gartland did not have the authority to sell or make decisions regarding the products of other ecolab divisions including the institutional division gartland may have benefitted indirectly through increases in institutional sales through corporate good will or increased pest elimination sales opportunities but his compensation was dependent upon pest elimination sales under the narrow interpretation of the contract gartland only handled pest elimination products and services thus gartland can be barred only from competing with ecolabs pest elimination division diversey does not compete with this ecolab division the trial court therefore erred in finding that ecolab was likely to prove gartland breached the noncompete agreement of course gartland remains bound by his agreement not to disclose confidential information acquired while an ecolab employee because we conclude that the noncompete agreement does not apply to the activities that ecolab seeks to enjoin we do not reach gartlands other arguments for reversing the trial courts order we note however that our decision is bolstered by our concerns that the trial court did not make the appropriate findings on the relative harms to be suffered by the parties in this case although the trial court concluded that ecolab faced a clear threat of irreparable harm its order does not include findings regarding the harms gartland might suffer if the injunction issued gartland has a lower standard to meet to bar the injunction therefore findings on this issue were necessary see yager v thompson  nwd   minnapp party seeking to trigger injunction must show irreparable harm but opposing party must only show substantial harm to bar it similarly the trial courts order suggests that it did not consider the reasonableness of the noncompete agreement an inquiry which requires a balancing of the equities satellite indus v keeling  nwd   minnapp  review denied minn jan   consequently this case is not the exceptional one in which the injunction may issue in spite of ecolabs weak showing of likelihood of success on the merits see sanborn mfg co  nwd at  if plaintiffs make strong showing of irreparable harm but weak showing of likely success on the merits injunction may still issue gartland also argues that the trial court erred by failing to condition the temporary injunction upon the filing of some form of security and by failing to address whether a bond was required in its order because we hold in gartlands favor we do not reach this issue we note however that minnrcivp  provides that a temporary injunction shall not be granted unless security is provided to guarantee payment of costs or damages incurred by the wrongful issuance of an injunction in the exercise of its discretion a trial court may waive the security requirement howe v howe  nwd   minnapp to facilitate appellate review however a trial court should note its decision to do so see bioline inc v burman  nwd   minnapp trial court abused its discretion either by failing to address security requirement or by waiving the requirement without stating its reasons for doing so we deny gartlands motion to strike portions of ecolabs appendix the record on appeal consists of the the papers filed in the trial court the exhibits and the transcript of the proceedings if any minn rcivappp  the items about which gartland complains are in the district court file a fact gartland does not contest decision the trial court erred in construing the noncompete agreement broadly and abused its

norton pj and huspeni and klaphake jj opinion norton judge respondent ecolab inc sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief against appellant thomas gartland a former employee for breach of a noncompete agreement and misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information the trial court issued a temporary injunction against gartland gartland appeals from this order arguing the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the injunction we reverse and remand facts appellant thomas gartland began working for respondent ecolab inc ecolab on october   as a territory manager in training on october   he signed a noncompete agreement the pertinent provision of the agreement states for a period of one  year immediately following the termination of his employment with the company the employee will not service sell solicit the sale of or accept orders for any competing products to any customer of the company with whom the employee did business or whose accounts was supervised by or assigned to the employee or with regard to which the employee received commissions or other compensation at any time during the twelve  month period immediately preceding the termination of his employment during said one year following termination the employee also will not assist any competing firm to engage in the activities prohibited by the foregoing sentence a competing firm means any person or organization including one owned in whole or in party by the employee which is engaged in the development production use marketing or sale of a competing product a competing product means any product or service which is the same as or similar to and competes with a product or service of the company which was part of the product or service line handled by the employee or persons supervised by the employee during his last two  years of employment by the company the agreement also contains a confidentiality provision under which gartland agreed not to disclose confidential information acquired while at ecolab although ecolab had a policy of requiring upperlevel management to sign a more restrictive noncompete agreement when promoted ecolab did not require gartland to sign any other agreement than the one at issue here gartland first worked in ecolabs institutional division which manufactures and sells soap and detergent products to various institutions he advanced to the position of district manager then assistant vice president of national accounts on january   gartland moved laterally to the pest elimination division which provides extermination products and services to restaurants hotels and motels in january  gartland was promoted to vice president of national accounts for the pest elimination division and in  to vice president corporate accounts pest elimination for north america he remained with the pest elimination division until he resigned in november  the pest elimination and institutional divisions of ecolab are operated as separate organizations with separate financial structures sales and service organizations and management teams ecolab encourages cooperative sales efforts between its divisions however through a circle the customer concept the goal of this strategy is to have ecolab service all of a customers needs that can be met by ecolabs different divisions gartland utilized ecolabs circle the customer strategy in building business for the pest elimination division he participated in joint sales calls and joint proposals made to institutional customers as well as market strategy planning with institutional personnel he required the employees he supervised to do likewise in addition he promoted institutional product sales by providing  introductions for institutional sales personnel with pest elimination customers in november  gartland accepted a position with diversey corp a major competitor of ecolabs institutional division when ecolab learned gartland had solicited business for diversey from ecolabs institutional customers it notified gartland and diversey by letter dated january   that it considered his actions a breach of the noncompete agreement diversey who interpreted the noncompete agreement as preventing gartland from competing with ecolabs pest elimination division only responded by stating that gartland would not refrain from soliciting ecolabs institutional customers ecolab filed this action and moved for a temporary injunction after a hearing the trial court issued the injunction restraining gartland from contacting or accepting orders for institutional sales products and services from all former customers constituting ecolabs institutional corporate sales accounts whom gartland contacted and had access to in accordance with employment agreement the trial court found that even though gartland worked for the pest elimination division he had handled institutional products through his extensive participation in the circle the customer concept it also found ecolab had proved a threat of irreparable harm through the potential for wrongful disclosure of confidential institutional information to which gartland had had access through his participation in the circle the customer program gartland requested and this court granted an expedited appeal issue did the district court err in its interpretation of the noncompete agreement and abuse its discretion by granting the temporary injunction analysis a temporary injunction is an extraordinary equitable remedy that preserves the status quo pending a trial on the merits central lakes educ assn v independent sch dist no   nwd   minnapp review denied minn nov   a party seeking a temporary injunction must show it has no adequate remedy at law and interim relief is necessary to prevent great and irreparable injury id quoting cherne indus v grounds  assocs  nwd   minn the decision to grant a temporary injunction is committed to the trial courts discretion and should be reversed only upon a clear abuse of discretion carl bolander  sons co v city of minneapolis  nwd   minn we view the facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing below north star state bank v north star bank minnesota  nwd   minnapp  review denied minnapr   when reviewing a trial courts decision to issue a temporary injunction this court considers five factors  the relationship of the parties  the relative harm to the parties if the injunction is or is not granted  the likelihood of success on the merits  public policies expressed in statutes and  the administrative burdens in supervising and enforcing the decree sanborn mfg co v currie  nwd   minnapp the factor of greatest concern here is ecolabs likelihood of success on the merits the court dislikes and closely scrutinizes noncompete agreements because they partially restrict trade national recruiters v cashman  nwd   minn in order to be enforceable noncompete agreements must be reasonable and supported by consideration see davies  davies agency v davies  nwd   minn discussing policy reasons for these elements gartland argues that the trial court erred when it found that ecolab would likely prove that the noncompete agreement at issue here is enforceable and would preclude him from competing with ecolabs institutional division we agree the noncompete agreement defines a competing product as one similar to and competitive with part of the product or service line handled by the employee this case  turns upon whether that phrase applies only to the products sold by the pest elimination division in which gartland worked for the last two years of his ecolab employment or whether that phrase can be applied to the product lines of other divisions with which gartland had significant interaction both parties offer reasonable definitions for handle gartland relying on several insurance law cases urges us to adopt a narrow definition to buy and sell or to deal or trade in see eg olympic ss co v centennial ins co  washd   pd    adopting similar definition ecolab on the other hand urges a broad definition the trial court extracted from a missouri tax law case state ex rel bell v phillips petroleum co  mo   swd    relying on this case the trial court here found handle meant to control direct to deal with to act upon and to perform some function with regard to to manage or operate in addition to sell buy deal or trade in a contract is ambiguous when its language is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation current technology concepts v irie enter  nwd   minn although it is unclear whether the trial court found the language at issue here ambiguous we note that the question of whether an ambiguity exists is one of law see id because both of the definitions offered by the parties could reasonably be applied to the contract language we conclude that the language is ambiguous when construing an ambiguous contract the court has a duty to give effect to the intent of the parties turner v alpha phi sorority house  nwd   minn midway ctr assocs v midway ctr inc  minn    nwd    the court construes any ambiguities in the contract against the drafting party current technology concepts  nwd at  as the supreme court has stated where a contract is open to two interpretations the one more favorable to the party who did not draft the instrument should be adopted in the absence of a clear showing that a contrary meaning was intended by the parties at the time of its execution wick v murphy  minn    nwd    accord turner  nwd at  beattie v product design  engg  minn    nwd    a court ascertains the parties intent by putting itself in the parties positions at the time they formed the contract and determining what they reasonably meant to accomplish in view of the contract as a whole its plain language and the surrounding circumstances midway ctr assocs  minn at   nwd at  the court may also rely on extrinsic evidence to resolve an ambiguity see turner  nwd at  court consulted various possible definitions to decide meaning of terms at issue the trial court here held that the broader definition of handle was warranted because the court is not convinced by defendants interpretation of the term handle in the context of this case defendants attempt to narrowly construe the language of the noncompete provision undermines the meaning of handle as it applies to sales industry standards especially with regards to positions in upper management corporate sales we conclude that the trial court erred by applying the broader definition first the court was not permitted to base its decision on industry standards because the record shows that the parties presented no evidence of the standard practices of any corporation except ecolab furthermore the evidence pertaining to ecolabs business practices relates to current practices the record is not clear about when ecolab instituted its circle the customer program or whether it anticipated that gartland would have such significant interaction with other ecolab divisions we note that at the time gartland signed the agreement he was a territory manager in training not the senior sales executive he was at his departure this evidence is not helpful in ascertaining what the parties intent was fifteen years ago in  when ecolab and gartland entered into the noncompete agreement  the intent of the agreement clearly enough was to prevent ecolabs employees from using the training confidential information and good will developed while at ecolab to compete directly with ecolab that intent is an insufficient basis upon which to infer that ecolab in  intended the noncompete agreement to apply to the present circumstances public policy requires that restrictive covenants be strictly construed and not extended beyond the true intent of the parties naftalin v john wood co  minn    nwd    we note that the language reads the product or service line handled by the employee not any or all lines handled by the employee this language supports a narrow construction furthermore the record contains a different ecolab noncompete agreement with more restrictive language which shows that ecolab recognized its need to protect its investment in situations like the one at issue here and knew how to accomplish that based on the evidence in the record gartland was entitled to the benefit of the rule mandating strict construction of the ambiguity the trial court erred by not construing the agreement narrowly the record shows ecolabs different operating divisions were maintained separately within the corporation with separate product lines management structures and financial operations while working in the pest elimination division gartland did not have the authority to sell or make decisions regarding the products of other ecolab divisions including the institutional division gartland may have benefitted indirectly through increases in institutional sales through corporate good will or increased pest elimination sales opportunities but his compensation was dependent upon pest elimination sales under the narrow interpretation of the contract gartland only handled pest elimination products and services thus gartland can be barred only from competing with ecolabs pest elimination division diversey does not compete with this ecolab division the trial court therefore erred in finding that ecolab was likely to prove gartland breached the noncompete agreement of course gartland remains bound by his agreement not to disclose confidential information acquired while an ecolab employee because we conclude that the noncompete agreement does not apply to the activities that ecolab seeks to enjoin we do not reach gartlands other arguments for reversing the trial courts order we note however that our decision is bolstered by our concerns that the trial court did not make the appropriate findings on the relative harms to be suffered by the parties in this case although the trial court concluded that ecolab faced a clear threat of irreparable harm its order does not include findings regarding the harms gartland might suffer if the injunction issued gartland has a lower standard to meet to bar the injunction therefore findings on this issue were necessary see yager v thompson  nwd   minnapp party seeking to trigger injunction must show irreparable harm but opposing party must only show substantial harm to bar it similarly the trial courts order suggests that it did not consider the reasonableness of the noncompete agreement an inquiry which requires a balancing of the equities satellite indus v keeling  nwd   minnapp  review denied minn jan   consequently this case is not the exceptional one in which the injunction may issue in spite of ecolabs weak showing of likelihood of success on the merits see sanborn mfg co  nwd at  if plaintiffs make strong showing of irreparable harm but weak showing of likely success on the merits injunction may still issue gartland also argues that the trial court erred by failing to condition the temporary injunction upon the filing of some form of security and by failing to address whether a bond was required in its order because we hold in gartlands favor we do not reach this issue we note however that minnrcivp  provides that a temporary injunction shall not be granted unless  security is provided to guarantee payment of costs or damages incurred by the wrongful issuance of an injunction in the exercise of its discretion a trial court may waive the security requirement howe v howe  nwd   minnapp to facilitate appellate review however a trial court should note its decision to do so see bioline inc v burman  nwd   minnapp trial court abused its discretion either by failing to address security requirement or by waiving the requirement without stating its reasons for doing so we deny gartlands motion to strike portions of ecolabs appendix the record on appeal consists of the the papers filed in the trial court the exhibits and the transcript of the proceedings if any minn rcivappp  the items about which gartland complains are in the district court file a fact gartland does not contest decision the trial court erred in construing the noncompete agreement broadly and abused its discretion by determining that ecolab was entitled to temporary injunctive relief we reverse the order granting the temporary injunction and remand the case for trial on the merits reversed and remanded notes  our decision does not however preclude ecolab from prevailing in the trial for permanent injunctive relief if it can show evidence of the parties intent in  to permit a broader construction of the agreement than the facts here allow mn court cases find mn opinions at findlaw not a legal

manufacturer owed a duty to a noncommercial pilot who after purchasing an airplane from the manufacturer but failing to receive all of the flight training promised to him as part of that purchase died when his airplane crashed gary r prokop and his passenger james kosak died when prokops cirrus sr airplane crashed near hill city prokop had purchased the sr just  month before the crash as part of the purchase of the sr cirrus provided a training program for new owners that training program was designed to help alreadylicensed pilots transition into the sr one of the programs lessons detailed how to recover from a specific emergency situation while flying the sr prokop never received this lesson and he was attempting to recover from that emergency situation when he crashedfollowing the crash rick glorvigen as trustee for the next of kin of kosak commenced an action against cirrus and prokops estate in itasca county district court thomas m gartland as trustee for the next of kin of prokop also commenced an action against cirrus in itasca county district court glorvigen and gartland alleged that cirrus as a manufacturer and seller breached its duty to warn and to provide adequate instructions for the safe use of its airplanes cirrus sought indemnity from the university of north dakota aerospace foundation undaf with whom cirrus had contracted to provide the training to new owners undaf subsequently intervened in the casethe district court combined the two cases at trial the jury found cirrus undaf and prokop negligent cirrus and undaf made motions for judgment as a matter of law which the district court denied cirrus and undaf appealed the court of appeals reversed the district court concluding that cirrus did not have a duty to provide training and that the claims were barred by the educational malpractice doctrine glorvigen gartland and prokops estate petitioned our court for review on appeal the parties raise four primary issues  whether cirrus owed a duty  whether the negligence claim against cirrus and undaf is barred by the educational malpractice doctrine  whether the evidence presented at trial was legally sufficient to support the jurys finding on causation and  whether undaf can be held liable as an intervenor because we conclude that cirrus did not owe a duty to prokop or kosak we affirmcirrus sr purchasein december  gary r prokop a licensed pilot purchased a cirrus sr airplane the sr was prokops second airplane before purchasing the sr he owned and flew a  cessna  sky hawk logging at least  hours of flight time over the course of  years in the cessnait is undisputed that piloting the cessna is different than piloting the sr cirrus had incorporated into the sr âseveral features that were uncommon or entirely new to certified general aviation aircraftâ because of these features the sr was more sophisticated and powerful than the cessna for exampleand most important herethe sr had an autopilot function and the cessna did not captain james m walters an expert airplane accident investigator testified at trial about the significance of an autopilot according to captain waltersan autopilot will do a lot of good things for the pilot of an aircraft depending on the capabilities of that particular autopilot and this one in the sr is a very good one in its most basically sic form it will keep the wings levelit will also maintain a heading across the ground and it will maintain altitude if its all programmed properly to do thatthe sr also had an advanced gps system and travelled at a cruising speed of  knots onethird times faster than the cessna finally the federal aviation administration faa requires most pilots including prokop to earn a âhigh performance endorsementâ before flying the srdespite the special qualifications required to fly the sr cirrus marketed the airplane to âpilots with a wide range of experienceâ to âfacilitatea pilots transition to the srâ cirrus provided a âtwoday newowner training programâ as part of the purchase price of the airplane cirrus described the training program in a document provided to new owners called the âpilot training agreementâ cirrus also provided other written materials to new owners including a cirrus sr training manual an faaapproved pilots operating handbook and a separate autopilot pilots operating handbook as a new owner prokop received all of these resources when he purchased the srtransition trainingit is standard in the general aviation industry to provide âtransition trainingâ to alreadylicensed pilots who plan to fly a new or unfamiliar airplane transition training builds on the pilots previous experience and âgives the pilot extensive individualized trainingâ in the new airplane âteaching the pilot the differencesâ between the previous airplane and the new airplane a pilot is trained to âproficiencyâ when the pilot can âcontinually repeat whatever it is that he is expected to do in a proficient mannerâas noted earlier cirrus provided transition training as part of the purchase price of the sr in the past cirrus had contracted with the wings aloft flight school to provide transition training to new owners then from october  to july  cirrus provided transition training to new owners directly but by the time prokop purchased his sr cirrus had contracted with the undaf flight schoolâan entity separate from the university of north dakota âto provide transition trainingprokop purchased his sr and registered for transition training in december  the cirrus sr training manual outlined the âday transition training prokop was to receive cirrus explained that the purpose of the training programwas to build on the pilots existing knowledge and experience by reviewing the systems and procedures of the sr and by paying close attention to those areas that may be new to many pilots and ownersat the completion of the training pilots should feel confident and comfortable with the operation of their new aircraftthe training consisted of five separate sessions in each session the new owner would receive a lesson on the ground previewing certain inflight maneuvers and concerns following each ground lesson the owner would then participate in an inflight lesson in which he would review in the air what he had just learned on the ground as the new owner completed each round of ground and inflight lessons the undaf instructor would check off the ground lessons and the tasks and maneuvers the owner completed in the air on a corresponding syllabus at the same time the instructor would grade the owners performance by placing the check mark under âuâ for âunsatisfactoryâ âmâ for âmarginalâ âsâ for âsatisfactoryâ and âeâ for âexcellentâ the syllabus explained that âskipped items should be left uncheckedâ though âa maneuver in which a u or m grade is posted may be discontinued and remain incomplete at the instructors discretionâ in order to receive a completion certificate however the owner had to complete all maneuvers in the final evaluation flight earning an s or e gradeat the time prokop purchased the sr and began training he was licensed only to fly in âvisual flight ruleâ or vfr conditions vfr conditions are weather conditions in which âvisibility is three miles or greaterâ and the pilot is able to see the ground because prokop was only vfr licensed he could not legally fly in âinstrument meteorological conditionsâ or imc in imc a pilot is deprived of visual ground references and must rely on instruments to fly the airplanecirrus noted in its training manual that inadvertently entering imc a circumstance known as âvfr into imcâ is an emergency situation the emergency arises because the pilot experiences spatial disorientation which is a disagreement between the pilots senses and the pilots visual cues captain walters explainedbasically spatial disorientation is when your mind perceives something different in terms of your relationship with the earthâ¤ your mind thinks its climbing or descending or turning when in fact it may not be or in fact may be just the oppositeits a disagreement in simple terms in terms of what your senses are feeling your senses are essentially your ear your inner ear is a big one â¤ its what we would call flying by the seat of your pants you know how that feels so when you dont agree you have a real problem you dont know which one to believe and typically you tend to believe the visual one which isnt what you should believeâ¤spatial disorientation caused by vfr into imc is a leading cause of small plane crashes in the sr the correct procedure to follow upon entering inadvertent imc is to activate the autopilotcirrus provided prokop with information in a variety of formats about using the autopilot to recover from vfr into imc in the sr first the pilots operating handbook and autopilot pilots operating handbook explained how to use the autopilot and the cirrus sr training manual included diagrams about coping with inadvertent imc second prokop watched powerpoint slides about the autopilot and recovering from vfr into imc during a ground lesson finally the training syllabus indicates that in flight lesson a prokop was supposed to practice a maneuver called ârecovery from vfr into imc autopilot assistedâ flight lesson a is at the heart of this caseprokop arrived for training in duluth on december   prokops undaf instructor was yu weng shipek it appears from the record that prokops training began in keeping with the process discussed earlier each time prokop completed a ground lesson or inflight maneuver shipek placed a corresponding check mark next to the lesson or maneuver on the syllabus the majority of the maneuvers listed on the syllabus have a corresponding check mark but none of the maneuvers under flight lesson a have a corresponding check mark according to the syllabus that omission indicates that the maneuvers were either skipped or left incomplete at shipeks discretionflight lesson a was titled âifr flight nonratedâ and was supposed to follow a ground lesson titled âvfr into imc proceduresâ flight lesson a is generally taught âunder the hood â in âunder the hoodâ lessons a new owner wears a hood over his head so that he cannot use visual cues outside the airplane in flight lesson a the owner is supposed to activate the autopilot and make a  degree turn as if exiting inadvertent imc while wearing the hood shipek testified that he gave flight lesson a to prokop but failed to document it on the syllabus but neither the syllabus nor prokops log books confirm that the lesson was completedevidence was presented at trial emphasizing the importance of learning to activate the autopilot while in flight for example john wahlberg undafs director of transition training at the cirrus facility testified that autopilotassisted recovery is âthe safest maneuverâ during vfr into imc but that âin order for this training to take in order for training to be effective you cant just do it on the groundâ¤ it has to be done up in the sky with the pilotâ wahlberg also agreed that the speed at which an sr can travel complicates the recovery because it requires a fast response from the pilot increasing the importance that the pilot is able to execute the recovery procedure quickly or the pilot âmay dieâ further captain walters testified that skipping an inflight lesson on recovery from vfr into imc did not meet industry standardsairplane crashon january   prokop and his friend and passenger james kosak intended to fly from grand rapids to saint cloud to watch their sons play in an earlymorning hockey game to determine whether weather conditions were safe to fly in prokop called faa weather briefers twice when prokop called the faa at  am the briefer told prokop that there was âpotential for some ifrâ and âoccasional moderate turbulenceâ prokop called the faa again around  am this time the briefer told prokop there were âmarginalâ conditions around grand rapids prokop told the briefer he was âhoping to slide underneath the conditions and then climb outâ captain walters testified that while these conditions were not ideal for flying prokop could fly legally under these circumstancesaround  am while it was still dark outside prokop and kosak departed from the grand rapids airport in prokops sr the flight began in vfr conditions according to captain walters prokop started the flight by taking off to the northwest soon after the takeoff prokop encountered turbulence because prokop was likely âbeing bumped around like crazyâ captain walters said he believed that prokop âmade a decision he said this is lousy im going homeâ but before prokop could safely begin his route home he entered imclike conditions and became spatially disoriented captain walters explainedhes not an instrument rated pilot hes in a really uncomfortable position he cant see the horizon its dark theres very few lights to navigate by but he wants to go homewalters stated that prokop struggled to maintain appropriate altitude and control of the angle of the airplane due to his spatial disorientation eventually the sr entered an accelerated stall captain walters testified that the accelerated stallwas a sudden eventit wasnt something that was expected because it happened at a speed that was faster than he expected it happened at an altitude of the airplane that was different than expected so it was a surprising eventafter the airplane entered the accelerated stall prokop lost control of the airplane the airplane then ârapidly descended to the groundâ killing both prokop and kosakcaptain walters testified that the entrance into âimclike conditionsâ triggered the crash âhad prokop been able to recover during those imclike conditions certainly the accident would not have happenedâ captain walters also testified that prokop had not activated the autopilot at all during the flight finally captain walters testified to âthree root  causesâ of the crash  âprokop made a poor decision to go flyingâ  âprokop was not given the tools that he needed to make an appropriate decisionâ and  prokop was not âgiven the proper tools to be able to recover from that eventâlitigationin july  rick glorvigen as trustee for the next of kin of kosak commenced an action against both cirrus and prokops estate glorvigen alleged negligence and breach of an implied warranty of merchantability against cirrus and alleged negligent piloting against prokops estate at the same time thomas m gartland as trustee for the next of kin of prokop also brought a wrongful death action against cirrus alleging negligence and various products liability claims the negligence claims of both glorvigen and gartland alleged that cirrus had a duty to train prokop by virtue of including transition training as part of the purchase price of the srin september  cirrus removed the two cases to federal district court arguing that faa regulations preempted state law claims the court rejected cirruss claims and remanded both cases to state court on remand the state district court âconsolidated the actions for purposes of discovery and trialâcirrus subsequently brought a thirdparty action against employees of the faa the faa responded to the thirdparty action by removing the cases to federal district court cirrus then sought summary judgment in the federal district court in february  the court granted cirruss motions for summary judgment on claims of strict liability and breach of implied and express warranty but the court denied cirruss motions for summary judgment on the claim of preemption and notably on the claim of negligence the federal district court then remanded the cases to state courtin september  undaf intervened undaf asserted that it hoped âto control the strategy of and to present its own defense for any claims for which undaf may have indemnity liability under the indemnity agreement between undaf and cirrusâ undaf also submitted answers to the complaints brought by glorvigen and gartland against cirrus meanwhile cirrus appealed the federal district courts remand of the cases to the state court to the eighth circuit which affirmed the federal district court glorvigen v cirrus design corp  fd  th cirfinally in may  the combined remaining claims of glorvigen and gartland were tried to a state court jury at the close of trial the district court submitted a special verdict form to the jury the special verdict form asked the jury to consider whether cirrus undaf and prokop were  negligent and if so  whether that negligence was a direct cause of the crash the special verdict form also asked whether undaf had acted as an agent for cirrus at the time of prokops training and whether cirrus and undaf had acted in a joint enterprise the jury answered âyesâ to all of the questions presented and found cirrus  percent negligent undaf  percent negligent and prokop  percent negligent the jury awarded glorvigen on behalf of kosak  in damages and gartland on behalf of prokop  in damagescirrus and undaf brought motions for  judgment as a matter of law  a new trial and  amendment of the findings of fact conclusions of law order for judgment and judgment the district court denied the motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial the court granted the motions for amendment of findings of fact conclusions of law order for judgment and judgmentcirrus and undaf appealed the district courts denial of their motions for judgment as a matter of law glorvigen v cirrus design corp  nwd  minnapp a divided panel of the court of appeals concluded that cirrus and undaf were not liable as a matter of law because cirruss duty to warn did not include a duty to provide pilot training and because the negligence claim was barred by the educational malpractice doctrine id at â the dissent concluded that âthe majoritys view of this case depends on weighing the facts found by the jury in a light unfavorable to its verdict sidestepping settled principles of negligence law while expanding the educationalmalpractice doctrineâ id at  klaphake j dissenting we granted review of the claims of glorvigen gartland and prokops estate and also granted the conditional petition for further review brought by undafon appeal appellants glorvigen gartland and prokops estate argue that they submitted a products liability claim based on a theory of negligence at trial and that the jurys verdict in their favor should not be overturned first appellants contend that cirrus and undaf owed a duty to prokop and kosak to give flight lesson a because as a supplier and manufacturer cirrus owed a duty to give adequate instructions in the safe use of its airplane second appellants contend that even if cirrus did not owe a duty to give flight lesson a as part of its duty to give adequate instructions cirrus assumed a duty to provide flight lesson a when it undertook to provide the lesson as part of the purchase price of the sr under either theory appellants contend that the jury found that cirrus breached its duty by failing to provide flight lesson a and that the district courts denial of judgment as a matter of law âjmolâ was appropriatecirrus argues that it did not owe a duty to train prokop and thus appellants products liability claim fails first cirrus contends that it properly discharged its duty to give adequate instructions through the written instructions provided to prokop second cirrus contends that it could not assume a duty in tort to provide flight lesson a because any such duty arose out of the contract with prokop additionally cirrus contends that even if it owed a duty to provide flight lesson a the educational malpractice doctrine bars appellants claim and that appellants did not establish causation at trialundaf argues that it owed no relevant duty to prokop or kosak first undaf contends that it had no duty to prevent injury to prokop after its instruction with prokop ended second undaf contends that it owed no duty to kosak because it had no special relationship with kosak additionally undaf contends that the educational malpractice doctrine bars appellants claim that appellants failed to establish causation at trial and that appellants never asserted claims against undaf and thus undaf cannot be held liableiwe turn first to the products liability claim but before reaching the merits of the claim we consider two preliminary procedural issues raised by cirrus first cirrus contends that the federal district court ânecessarily foreclose dâ appellants products liability claim based on negligence when the court dismissed on summary judgment appellants strict liability for failure to instruct claim see hauenstein v loctite corp  nwd   minn â âas a practical matter where the strict liability claim is based on â¤ failure to warn â¤ there is essentially no difference between strict liability and negligenceâ â quoting holm v sponco mfg inc  nwd   minn second cirrus contends that at trial appellants pleaded and argued a common law negligence claim not a products liability claim thus cirrus contends that appellants are now attempting to ârecharacterizeâ their common law negligence claim and that the products liability claim is not before our court because we conclude that appellants claim fails on its merits we need not and do not reach these procedural issuesiiwe turn now to the merits of the products liability claim appellants glorvigen gartland and prokops estate appeal from the court of appeals reversal of the district courts denial of cirruss and undafs motions for jmol we review a district courts denial of a jmol motion de novo bahr v boise cascade corp  nwd   minn in this case our review of the denial of the jmol motions requires us to determine whether cirrus owed a duty to prokop or kosak we also review the existence of a duty de novo bjerke v johnson  nwd   minn finally when reviewing the existence of a duty on denial of a jmol motion we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict see bahr  nwd at products liability is âa manufacturers or sellers tort liability for any damages or injuries suffered by a buyer user or bystander as a result of a defective product products liability can be based on a theory of negligence strict liability or breach of warrantyâ blacks law dictionary  th ed when liability is based on a theory of negligence âa plaintiff must prove  the existence of a duty of care  a breach of that duty  an injury and  that the breach of the duty of care was a proximate cause of the injuryâ domagala v rolland  nwd   minn duty is a threshold question âbecause a defendant cannot breach a nonexistent dutyâ id further âwhether there exists a duty is a legal issue for court resolutionâ germann v fl smithe mach co  nwd   minn if no duty exists it is error for the district court to submit the negligence claim to the jury see id at âin minnesota ânegligence law on a suppliers duty to warn is well developed in general a supplier has a duty to warn end users of a dangerous product if it is reasonably foreseeable that an injury could occur in its useâ gray v badger mining corp  nwd   minn a suppliers duty to warn extends to all âreasonably foreseeable usersâ hauenstein v loctite corp  nwd   minn we have described the duty to warn as consisting of âtwo duties the duty to give adequate instructions for safe use and  the duty to warn of dangers inherent in improper usageâ frey v montgomery ward  co  nwd   minn âto be legally adequate a warning should  attract the attention of those that the product could harm  explain the mechanism and mode of injury and  provide instructions on ways to safely use the product to avoid injuryâ gray  nwd at  foreseeability is the âlinchpin for determination whether a duty to warn existsâ germann  nwd at  to determine whether a duty to warn exists our courtgoes to the event causing the damage and looks back to the alleged negligent act if the connection is too remote to impose liability as a matter of public policy we then hold there is no duty and consequently no liability on the other hand if the consequence is direct and is the type of occurrence that was or should have been reasonably foreseeable we then hold as a matter of law a duty exists other issues such as adequacy of the warning breach of duty and causation remain for jury resolutionid at âhere no party disputes that as a supplier and manufacturer of airplanes cirrus had a duty to warn foreseeable users like prokop further no party disputes that cirruss duty to warn included a âduty to give adequate instructionsâ on the safe use of cirrus airplanes to foreseeable users gray  nwd at  instead the dispute centers on whether cirruss duty to warn required cirrus to provide flight lesson awe conclude that cirruss duty to warn did not require cirrus to provide flight lesson a cirrus provided prokop with written instructions on the autopilot and recovery from vfr into imcâthe same information that was to be presented in flight lesson aâin a number of formats the pilots operating handbook and autopilot pilots operating handbook explained how to use the autopilot the cirrus sr training manual included diagrams about coping with inadvertent imc and prokop watched powerpoint slides about the autopilot and vfr into imc during a ground lessonappellants do not argue that these written instructions were inaccurate or incomplete only that the written instructions could not adequately instruct prokop in the safe use of the sr because the instructions necessarily lacked flight lesson a we disagree the duty to warn has never before required a supplier or manufacturer to provide training only accurate and thorough instructions on the safe use of the product as cirrus has done here see frey  nwd at our case law bears out this conclusion for example in frey v montgomery ward  co we considered whether a manufacturer of space heaters breached its duty to warn because its âprinted booklets did not state that the space heaters should not be used in house trailersââinformation necessary to âassure safe useâ of the product id at   emphasis added likewise in germann v fl smithe machine co we held that the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict that a manufacturer of hydraulic presses breached its duty to warn because its âmanuals containing instructions for assembling and maintenanceâ did not warn of the danger âof running the press without a properly attached and operating safety barâ  nwd at   emphasis added finally in gray v badger mining corp we considered whether a supplier of sand had a duty to warn looking to the suppliers âwarnings and safety instructions printed on a material safety data sheetâ to see if they adequately warned of the âhazards of silica dustâ  nwd at  â emphasis addedthese cases demonstrate that we have recognized that the duty to warn requires a supplier or manufacturer to provide adequate instructions and warnings to foreseeable users frey  nwd at  but there is no duty for suppliers or manufacturers to train users in the safe use of their product indeed imposing a duty to train would be wholly unprecedented appellants cite no caseâfrom any courtâin which a supplier or manufacturer was obligated to provide training in order to discharge its duty to warn yet that obligation is exactly what appellants request our court to impose here specifically appellants argue that because it was foreseeable that âa pilot â¤ not adequately instructed and trained to take the necessary actions in the sr to escape from inadvertent entry into imcâ may have an accident and because a âdirect connection exists between the omitted training and the accident here â¤ a conclusion that a duty exists necessarily followsâ emphasis added while we agree that foreseeability guides our determination of whether a duty to warn exists we do not agree that foreseeability leads to a conclusion that cirruss duty to warn included an obligation to provide trainingcirrus provided written instructions that â attracted the attention of those that the product could harm  explained the mechanism and mode of injury and  provided instructions on ways to safely use the product to avoid injuryâ as required under our law gray  nwd at  thus cirrus adequately discharged its duty to warn because cirrus adequately discharged its duty to warn without providing training to hold now that cirrus must provide training would either create a new common law duty to train or expand the duty to warn to include training under either theory imposition of a duty to train would require an unprecedented expansion of the law and we decline to do so accordingly we conclude that cirrus did not owe a duty to train prokop this conclusion does not end our analysis however while cirrus did not owe a duty to train prokop cirrus may have assumed a duty to provide flight lesson a by undertaking to provide the lesson we have said that âit is ancient learning that one who assumes to act even though gratuitously may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully if he acts at allâ isler v burman  minn    nwd    citation omitted in other words âone who voluntarily assumes a duty must exercise reasonable careâ even if he is not otherwise obligated to provide the care âor he will be responsible for damages resulting from his failure to do soâ id at   nwd at nevertheless a party is not responsible for damages in tort if the duty breached was â âmerely â¤ imposed by contractâ â and not â âimposed by lawâ â d  a dev co v butler  nwd   minnapp quoting keiper v anderson  minn    nw    the â âfundamental differences between tort and contractâ â actions support this rule id at  quoting w prosser handbook of the law of torts Â§  at  th ed we explained those differences in  south eighth street ltd partnership v careyâcanada inctort actions and contract actions protect different interests through a tort action the duty of certain conduct is imposed by law and not necessarily by the will or intention of the parties the duty may be owed to all those within the range of harm or to a particular class of people on the other hand contract actions protect the interests in having promises performed contract obligations are imposed because of conduct of the parties manifesting consent and are owed only to the specific parties named in the contract nwd  â minn because of the differences between tort and contract actions âwhen a contract provides the only source of duties between the parties minnesota law does not permit the breach of those duties to support a cause of action in negligenceâ united states v johnson  fd   th cir citing lesmeister v dilly  nwd   minnhere prokop contracted with cirrus to purchase the sr in that contract cirrus undertook to provide flight lesson a as part of the transition training included in the purchase price of the sr accordingly cirruss obligation to provide flight lesson a arose from the contract where a party cannot prove that the duty at issue arose independent of a contract âminnesota law precludes that party from recovering in negligence based upon breach of that duty â johnson  fd at  as discussed above we conclude that cirrus does not owe a duty imposed by law to provide flight lesson a thus because the duty at issueâto provide flight lesson aâcould only have arisen from the contract appellants may not recover in tort see id d  a dev co  nwd at âbecause we conclude that  cirrus did not owe a duty to train and that  cirrus did not assume a duty to provide flight lesson a outside of its contract with prokop we hold that cirrus did not owe a duty to prokop or kosak the breach of which is recoverable in tort we therefore hold that the district court erred when it denied cirruss and undafs motions for jmol and affirm the court of appeals accordingly we do not reach the issues of educational malpractice causation or undafs liabilityaffirmeddissenti respectfully dissent i write separately because i disagree with the majoritys holding that as a matter of law no consumer product exists for which a supplier is required to give any warning to consumers beyond written instructions no matter how dangerous the product and regardless of any jury findings to the contrary the majority makes this holding even in the face of a suppliers promiseâhere cirruss promiseâto provide certain nonwritten instructions i conclude the majoritys holding usurps the role of the jury and misreads our precedent in particular i would defer to the verdict which is based on the jurys finding that cirruss warning to prokop was inadequate without flight lesson a i would also hold that cirrus assumed a duty in tort despite maintaining a contractual relationship with prokop therefore i would reverse the court of appeals and allow the jury verdict to standito prove a products liability claim based on a theory of negligence appellants glorvigen gartland and prokops estate âmust prove  the existence of a duty of care  a breach of that duty  an injury and  that the breach of the duty of care was a proximate cause of the injuryâ domagala v rolland  nwd   minn in minnesota suppliers of dangerous products have âa duty to warn end users of the dangerous product if it is reasonably foreseeable that an injury could occur in its useâ gray v badger mining corp  nwd   minn the existence of a duty to warn is a legal question âfor court resolutionâ germann v fl smithe mach co  nwd   minn in this case both the federal district court and state district court determined that cirrus owed a duty to warn foreseeable users like prokop no party argues otherwiseafter the state district court determined that cirrus owed a duty to warn that court submitted the remaining elements of appellants claim to the jury the court properly submitted these elements to the jury because while the existence of a duty to warn is for court resolution the other elements of a products liability negligence claim are not balder v haley  nwd   minn germann  nwd at â specifically the âadequacy of the warningâ should âremain for jury resolutionâ balder  nwd at  germann  nwd at â in other words once the state district court determined that cirrus owed a duty to warn it was up to the juryânot the court and certainly not our courtâto determine whether cirrus provided an adequate warning or whether cirrus breached its duty to warn here the jury determined that cirruss warning was inadequatedespite all of the written materials cirrus provided to prokopwe do not disturb a jurys verdict unless the verdict cannot âbe sustained on any reasonable theory of the evidenceâ pouliot v fitzsimmons  nwd   minn in this case the jurys verdict was amply supported by evidence in the record the jury heard evidence that inflight instruction on recovery from vfr into imc was necessary to learn how to safely exit imc in the sr because according to the university of north dakotas aerospace foundations director of transition training instruction like flight lesson a was the only way âfor the training to take because you cant just do it on the groundâ¤ it has to be done up in the sky with the pilotâ the jury also heard evidence that prokop never received inflight instruction on recovery from vfr into imc finally the jury heard evidence that prokop crashed and died while attempting to recover from vfr into imcbased on the foregoing evidence the jury determined that cirruss written materials alone provided an inadequate warning the jury apparently found the warning inadequate because the warning lacked flight lesson a the only handson inflight training in recovery from vfr into imc that cirrus offered to prokop thus the jury determined that cirrus breached its duty to warn and returned a verdict awarding damages to the next of kin of prokop and kosak to help compensate them for cirruss breach because the adequacy of the warning was for jury resolution and because the jurys determination is sustained by a âreasonable theory of the evidenceâ i conclude that the determination is not of the type that our court has the authority to disregard pouliot  nwd at  germann  nwd at ânevertheless the majority holds as a matter of law that cirrus was not required to provide flight lesson a the majority does so on the theory that deferring to the jurys determination would in effect require a new duty of suppliersa duty to train specifically cirrus and amici argue and the majority accepts that if we were to hold that cirrus was obligated to provide flight lesson a in order to adequately discharge its duty to warn then all suppliersâeven suppliers of coffee pots according to statements made during oral argumentsâwill be required to provide training to their users this argument overreacts to the scope and impact of such a holdingfirst this court does not determine what cirrus or any other supplier must provide to adequately discharge its duty to warn rather we determine only the features a warning must possess further we do not determine what form such a warning must takeâthe jury makes that determination see balder  nwd at  the jurys determination will vary from case to case based on the facts of the case and the type of product the supplier providessecond suppliers must use care âcommensurateâ with âreasonably foreseeable dangersâânot with any conceivable danger domagala  nwd at  we have said that â âwhat constitutes reasonable care will of course vary with the surrounding circumstances and will involve a balancing of the likelihood of harm and the gravity of harm if it happens against the burden of the precaution which would be effective to avoid the harmâ â bilotta v kelley co  nwd   minn quoting holm v sponco  nwd   minn for example i find it absurd to assert that the âreasonably foreseeable dangersâ of operating a coffee pot are akin to the âreasonably foreseeable dangersâ of operating the sr an undisputedly fast and highly sophisticated airplane domagala  nwd at  thus i also find it absurd to assert that the reasonable care required of a coffee pot supplier and therefore the type of warning a coffee pot supplier must provide to consumers is akin to the type of warning that cirrus must provide to consumers who purchase and intend to operate the srfar from imposing a new duty to train on suppliers the jury in this case simply determined that a supplier of a dangerous product must provide a warning commensurate with that danger to consumers as required under our case law i conclude that the majority mistook whether cirrus owed a duty to warn which was for court resolution for the question whether cirrus adequately discharged its duty to warn which was for jury resolution germann  nwd at â accordingly i conclude that the majority oversteps our authority on review when the majority holds that cirrus was not required to provide flight lesson a to adequately discharge its duty to warn a conclusion that is clearly contrary to the jurys determination i would defer to the jurys proper determination and hold that cirruss warning to prokop was inadequateiieven if the majority is correct that deferring to the jurys determination would impose a new duty to train on suppliers i would still hold that cirrus owed a duty to provide flight lesson a because cirrus assumed that duty the majority holds that cirrus cannot assume a duty in tort because cirrus maintained a contractual relationship with prokop but it is well established in our case law that a party can assume a duty in tort despite maintaining a contractual relationship therefore i disagree with the majority on this key point in particular i conclude that the majority has overlooked specific accommodation in our case law that would allow the next of kin of prokop and kosak to recover in tort against cirrus despite the contractwe have said that when the âgravamen of a case â¤ is contractualâ and âany duties between the parties arose out of contractsâ a party cannot be held liable in negligence lesmeister v dilly  nwd   minn in other words âwhen a contract provides the only source of duties between the parties minnesota law does not permit the breach of those duties to support a cause of action in negligenceâ united states v johnson  fd   th cir citing lesmeister  nwd at  but even when parties are bound by contract our case law explicitly excludes claims arising from personal injury and for damages other than economic loss from the general rule that a party cannot be liable in tort see eg  s eighth st ltd pship v careyâcanada inc  nwd   minn âeconomic losses that arise out of commercial transactions except those involving personal injury or damage to other property are not recoverable under the tort theories of negligence or strict products liabilityâ emphasis added citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted additionally we appear to have adopted restatement second of torts Â§   which states that a party can assume a duty in tort even if undertaken âfor considerationâ restatement second of torts Â§  provides thatone who undertakes gratuitously or for consideration to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the others person or things is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking ifa his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm orb the harm is suffered because of the others reliance upon the undertakingemphasis added see eg funchess v cecil newman corp  nwd   minn state v philip morris inc  nwd  â minn that a person can undertake a duty in tort âfor considerationâ indicates that a person can assume a duty in tort through contractin this case it is undisputed that cirrus entered into a contract with prokop for the sale of the sr and that the contract specified that transition training was included in the purchase price based on this fact alone the majority ends its analysis and holds that because cirrus promised by contract to provide transition training including flight lesson a cirrus cannot be held liable in tort for failing to provide flight lesson a but our case law requires that our analysis go furtheras an initial matter the âgravamenâ of this case is not contractual lesmeister  nwd at  instead the âgravamenâ of this case sounds in tort id the parties assert only tortbased claims and the parties relationship is as much governed by cirruss tort duty to warn as the relationship is governed by cirruss contractual duties certainly the contract gives rise to cirruss duty to warn if prokop never contracted for the sr cirrus would not owe a duty to warn to prokop but it is cirruss status as the manufacturer and supplier of the sr not the contract that imposes the tort duty to warn see eg johnson  fd at  holding that where âa contract provided the only source of duties between the partiesâ tort liability was improper emphasis addedmoreover the claim in this case involves each of the two specific accommodations we have made in the past allowing a party to be liable in tort despite the presence of a contract first the claim at issue involves personal injury see  s eighth st  nwd at  second the claim involves noneconomicloss damages see id see also blacks law dictionary  th ed defining âeconomic lossâ in a products liability suit as âincluding the cost of repair or replacement of defective property as well as commercial loss for the propertys inadequate value and consequent loss of profits or useâ instead of seeking economic loss damages like the cost to repair the sr the parties seek such damages as âloss of counsel guidance aid advice comfort assistance protection and companionshipâ because we have recognized that a tort duty can be assumed for consideration see restatement second of torts Â§  and because we have distinguished between claims arising from purely economic loss and claims arising from personal injury our case law provides a basis to conclude that cirrus assumed a duty in tort despite cirruss contract with prokopthe majority reaches the opposite result more specifically the majority concludes that because we did not impose tort liability in cases in which the claim did not involve personal injury or noneconomicloss damages we may not impose tort liability when a claim does involve personal injury and noneconomicloss damages this conclusion overlooks the accommodation we have made in our case law for claims involving personal injury and noneconomicloss damages instead of restricting the result in this case our case law does the exact oppositeâit anticipates and intentionally accommodates an imposition of tort liability on cirrus it should be selfevident that a party who breaches a contract ought to be liable for the breach of that contract but a party should not be âimmunize d â¤ from tort liability for his wrongful actsâ just because those acts âgrow out ofâ or are âcoincidentâ to a contract eads v marks  cald   pd   cal if the mere presence of a contract foreclosed all tort liability medical malpractice claims would cease to exist a passenger injured in a car accident while riding in a taxi cab would have only a breach of contract claim against the cab driver and cab company a paid babysitter who failed to prevent injury to a child would be liable only in contract the list goes on while we have rightly limited tort liability when the relationship of the parties is governed purely by contract we have never foreclosedâindeed we have specifically accommodatedâtort liability when personal injury or noneconomicloss damages are assertedi conclude that the majoritys holding overlooks this accommodation in contrast i would hold that cirrus may assume a duty in tort to provide flight lesson a despite cirruss contract with prokop i reach this conclusion because the parties relationship is grounded in tort as well as contract and because the claim involves personal injury and noneconomicloss damages further i would conclude that by promising to provide flight lesson a cirrus did assume a duty in tort and may be held liable for breaching that dutyon a final note i am concerned about the farreaching consequences of the majoritys holding in this case by holding that a supplier of a dangerous product such as the sr is never required to provide anything beyond written instructionsâeven if the supplier has promised to provide nonwritten instructionsâthe majority has essentially held that no consumer of a dangerous product may ever hold a supplier liable for personal injury arising out of defective nonwritten instructions instead the majoritys holding indicates that the only remedy available to the injured consumer will be breach of contract but as the majority indicates in its opinion contract damages are generally inadequate and illsuited for personal injury claimsbased on the foregoing analysis in which i conclude that the majority has usurped the role of the jury and misread our case law i would hold that cirrus breached its duty to warn when it failed to provide flight lesson a as promised therefore i would reverse the court of appeals and allow the jury verdict
