company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price in the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into he was first accused of greenmail in late  during a run at cpc international when he bought  of cpc at around  a share and indirectly sold it back to cpc through salomon brothers a month later at  a share for a  million profit both cpc and perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary including what looked like an artificial price increase by salomon shortly before they sold perelmans shares another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the bestknown and stemmed from his attempt to purchase gillette in november  perelman opened negotiations with a bid of  billion gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading perelman accumulated  of gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to gillette later that month for a  million profit gillette had put word out that ralston purina had agreed to buy a  block of stock making any attempt by perelman to buy gillette much more difficult perelman decided to sell his share to ralston purina but before he did so gillettes executives called him up asking if hed sell his shares to them and theyd sell the shares to ralston purina he sold his shares to gillette and ralston backed out of the deal monica lewinskyedit perelman stumbled into the lewinsky scandal in early  vernon jordan recommended monica lewinsky to perelman as a potential employee pitching her as a very

with macandrews  forbes holdings vice president jaymie durnan durnan told perelman that he had determined there was no position available for lewinsky at perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he

perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company

when someone buys a large block of a companys stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price in the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into he was first accused of greenmail in late  during a run at cpc international when he bought  of cpc at around  a share and indirectly sold it back to cpc through salomon brothers a month later at  a share for a  million profit both cpc and perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary including what looked like an artificial price increase by salomon shortly before they sold perelmans shares another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the bestknown and stemmed from his attempt to purchase gillette in november  perelman opened negotiations with a bid of  billion gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading perelman accumulated  of gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to gillette later that month for a  million profit gillette had put word out that ralston purina had agreed to buy a  block of stock making any attempt by perelman to buy gillette much more difficult perelman decided to sell his share to ralston purina but before he did so gillettes executives called him up asking if hed sell his shares to them and theyd sell the shares to ralston purina he sold his shares to gillette and ralston backed out of the deal monica lewinskyedit perelman stumbled into the lewinsky scandal in early  vernon jordan recommended monica lewinsky to perelman as a potential employee pitching her as a very smart young woman while jordan was on the revlon board of directors jordan rarely spoke to perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him jordan indicated hed already talked about lewinsky with macandrews  forbes holdings vice president jaymie durnan durnan told perelman that he had determined there was no position available for lewinsky at perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he married sterling bank heiress faith golding in  and they divorced in  his marriage to gossip columnist claudia cohen

buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the companys money and made a very public spectacle of the divorce perelman responded by hiring roy cohn and flatly denying all of the

and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started perelman made only one of the payments claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films barkin sued for her money while perelman countersued alleging barkin and her brother had looted the film company for

large block of a companys stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price in the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into he was first accused of greenmail in late  during a run at cpc international when he bought  of cpc at around  a share and indirectly sold it back to cpc through salomon brothers a month later at  a share for a  million profit both cpc and perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary including what looked like an artificial price increase by salomon shortly before they sold perelmans shares another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the bestknown and stemmed from his attempt to purchase gillette in november  perelman opened negotiations with a bid of  billion gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading perelman accumulated  of gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to gillette later that month for a  million profit gillette had put word out that ralston purina had agreed to buy a  block of stock making any attempt by perelman to buy gillette much more difficult perelman decided to sell his share to ralston purina but before he did so gillettes executives called him up asking if hed sell his shares to them and theyd sell the shares to ralston purina he sold his shares to gillette and ralston backed out of the deal monica lewinskyedit perelman stumbled into the lewinsky scandal in early  vernon jordan recommended monica lewinsky to perelman as a potential employee pitching her as a very smart young woman while jordan was on the revlon board of directors jordan rarely spoke to perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him jordan indicated hed already talked about lewinsky with macandrews  forbes holdings vice president jaymie durnan durnan told perelman that he had determined there was no position available for lewinsky at perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he married sterling bank heiress faith golding in  and they divorced in  his marriage to gossip columnist claudia cohen lasted from  to  he wed socialite patricia duff in  and

bill for a bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of perelmans office faith threatened to scuttle perelmans attempt to take macandrews  forbes private in  by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name she further declared that perelman defrauded the owners of the first sterling corporation ie her by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the companys money and made a very public spectacle of the divorce perelman responded by hiring roy cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations the pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated

lobby when both were still married perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started perelman made only one of the payments claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films barkin sued for her money while perelman countersued alleging barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves anna chapmanedit perelman began dating psychiatrist dr

is serving as chairwoman of the ronald o perelman performing arts center controversyedit greenmailedit in the late s perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail greenmail occurs when someone buys a large block of a companys stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price in the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into he was first accused of greenmail in late  during a run at cpc international when he bought  of cpc at around  a share and indirectly sold it back to cpc through salomon brothers a month later at  a share for a  million profit both cpc and perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary including what looked like an artificial price increase by salomon shortly before they sold perelmans shares another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the bestknown and stemmed from his attempt to purchase gillette in november  perelman opened negotiations with a bid of  billion gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading perelman accumulated  of gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to gillette later that month for a  million profit gillette had put word out that ralston purina had agreed to buy a  block of stock making any attempt by perelman to buy gillette much more difficult perelman decided to sell his share to ralston purina but before he did so gillettes executives called him up asking if hed sell his shares to them and theyd sell the shares to ralston purina he sold his shares to gillette and ralston backed out of the deal monica lewinskyedit perelman stumbled into the lewinsky scandal in early  vernon jordan recommended monica lewinsky to perelman as a potential employee pitching her as a very smart young woman while jordan was on the revlon board of directors jordan rarely spoke to perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him jordan indicated hed already talked about lewinsky with macandrews  forbes holdings vice president jaymie durnan durnan told perelman that he had determined there was no position available for lewinsky at perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he married sterling bank heiress faith golding in  and they divorced in  his marriage to gossip columnist claudia cohen lasted from  to  he wed socialite patricia duff in  and

bill for a bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of perelmans office faith threatened to scuttle perelmans attempt to take macandrews  forbes private in  by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name she further declared that perelman defrauded the owners of the first sterling corporation ie her by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the companys money and made a very public spectacle of the divorce perelman responded by hiring roy cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations the pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to faith in excess of  million claudia cohenedit ronald and samantha perelman perelman met his second wife claudia cohen in  at le cirque they had one daughter together samantha in  in august  ron filed for divorce claudia left the marriage with well over  million in  claudia died after a secret sevenyear battle with ovarian cancer perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that hed

university of pennsylvania to cohen hall after his late exwife he donated  million to the university to remodel what is now perelman quadrangle and as part of his donation he had the option to change the name of logan hall his decision to rename logan hall dismayed some penn faculty alumni and students patricia duffedit patricia duff was perelmans third wife the pair first met in a paris hotel lobby when both were still married perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started perelman made only one of the payments claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films barkin sued for her money while perelman countersued alleging barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves anna chapmanedit perelman began dating psychiatrist dr

deliberated for two days found in favor of perelman and awarded him  billion the damages stung particularly because morgan stanley passed up perelmans offer to settle the case for  million morgan stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided citing the judges decision to use florida law over new york law and her decision to order the jury to consider morgan stanley guilty

actions perelman appealed but found himself shot down by the florida supreme court who dismissed it in a – decision undeterred even after that setback perelman went back to the trial court and asked

million profit both cpc and perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary including what looked like an artificial price increase by salomon shortly before they sold perelmans

indicated hed already talked about lewinsky with macandrews  forbes holdings vice president jaymie durnan durnan told perelman that he had determined there was no position available for lewinsky at perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has

bill for a bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of perelmans office faith threatened to scuttle perelmans attempt to take macandrews  forbes private in  by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name she further declared that perelman defrauded the owners of the first sterling corporation ie her by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the

lobby when both were still married perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started perelman made only one of the payments claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films barkin sued for her money while perelman countersued alleging barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves anna chapmanedit perelman began dating psychiatrist dr

sold his stake to gillette later that month for a  million profit gillette had put word out that ralston purina had agreed to buy a  block of stock making any attempt by perelman to buy gillette much more difficult perelman decided to sell his share to ralston purina but before he did so gillettes executives called him up asking if hed sell his shares to them and theyd sell the shares to ralston purina he sold his shares to gillette and ralston backed out of the deal monica lewinskyedit perelman stumbled into the lewinsky scandal in early  vernon jordan recommended monica lewinsky to perelman as a potential employee pitching her as a very smart young woman while jordan was on the revlon board of directors jordan rarely spoke to perelman and had never before recommended anyone to him jordan indicated hed already talked about lewinsky with macandrews  forbes holdings vice president jaymie durnan durnan told perelman that he had determined there was no position available for lewinsky at perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he married sterling bank heiress faith golding in  and they divorced in  his marriage to gossip columnist claudia cohen lasted from  to  he wed socialite patricia duff in  and

bill for a bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of perelmans office faith threatened to scuttle perelmans attempt to take macandrews  forbes private in  by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name she further declared that perelman defrauded the owners of the first sterling corporation ie her by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the companys money and made a very public spectacle of the divorce perelman responded by hiring roy cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations the pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to faith in excess of  million claudia cohenedit ronald and samantha perelman perelman met his second wife claudia cohen in  at le cirque they had one daughter together samantha in  in august  ron filed for divorce claudia left the marriage with well over  million in  claudia died after a secret sevenyear battle with ovarian cancer perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that hed known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her in march  perelman decided to change the name of logan hall located at the university of pennsylvania to cohen hall after his late exwife he donated  million to the university to remodel what is now perelman quadrangle and as part of his donation he had the option to change the name of logan hall his decision to rename logan hall dismayed some penn faculty alumni and students patricia duffedit patricia duff was perelmans third wife the pair first met in a paris hotel lobby when both were still married perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started perelman made only one of the payments claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films barkin sued for her money while perelman countersued alleging barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves anna chapmanedit perelman began dating psychiatrist dr anna chapman in mid in august  they announced they are expecting a baby—her first his seventh—via a surrogate in october  they were married chapman is a convert to judaism in late november  the couple

minchom ronald perelman settles revlon privatization case with sec – ronald perelman  bloomberg – by clive minchom on june th  revlon the publicly listed cosmetics company controlled by ronald o perelman’s investment company macandrews  forbes and of which he is chairman and ceo settled a dispute with the us financial industries regulator the securities  exchange commission sec  relating to an unsuccessful attempt he made in  to take revlon private – a company which he has controlled about  of since  mr perelman is certainly no stranger to litigation or to complicated transactions indeed it is probably no accident that in the degrees of complexity itself one can ultimately find tucked away issues that are the ones that end up being litigated under the terms of the settlement with the sec revlon agreed to pay a – very modest – fine of us  in order to put to bed the sec’s findings that it had deceived shareholders and its independent directors during the failed privatization attempt according to the new york times revlon has also already paid out in addition about us million in private lawsuits to shareholders and former shareholders to put the story behind it the sec press release announcing the settlement quoted antonia chion an associate director in the sec’s division of enforcement in connection with the settlement “goingprivate transactions create opportunities for shareholder abuse and can have coercive effects on minority shareholders ”… “by erecting informational barriers revlon kept critically important information from its board and in turn misled investors” in settling with the sec and with its private claimants revlon neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing macandrews  forbes has controlled over three quarters of revlon’s stock since  so the company has had little shareholder “float” which has therefore tended to discourage trading since he took it over in such circumstances even in the best of times the share price of a comparatively illiquid security can languish and lag its peers significantly in  during the height of then recessionary business conditions perelman tried in response to take over the rest of the shares he did not already own when you do something like that however independent directors and external third party advisors are usually called upon to determine that the terms of any such transaction are fair to the minority interests being acquired – whenever there is an insider with a potential informational advantage on his first attempt in  it seems the independent third party financial advisor determined that the terms perelman was proposing were indeed not fair to the minority shareholders of revlon accordingly as the new york times reported last week pereleman restructured his offer in response by proposing instead a a transaction in which the company asked minority shareholders to swap their stock for preferred shares the complex deal would apparently have also helped revlon pay off a substantial loan that it owed to macandrews  forbes the sec found as the tendered common shares would have then been simultaneously exchanged for a settlement of existing debt to its controlling shareholder however because mr perelman also stood on both sides of this deal there was a basic question about the transaction’s fairness and revlon again asked its independent board members to assess the deal revlon’s minority shareholders included persons invested in its stock through the company’s k retirement plan and the retirement plan’s trustee decided that its members could exchange their shares only if an outside investment banker decided that the transaction was adequate on looking at it the outside financial adviser chosen determined that it was also like the previous goingprivate transaction itself unfair – since in his opinion the preferred shares being offered were not equal to the value of the common stock being sought well that was his opinion but revlon however apparently then went to great lengths to hide that decision from the individual retirement plan members themselves which was the crux of the complaint made by the sec the sec had also charged that among other deceitful maneuvers revlon altered the agreement with the trustee to ensure that the trustee would not share the adviser’s opinion with revlon shareholders the company also then apparently misrepresented in securities filings that the board’s process was “full fair and complete” so with the settlements with the sec and with its own dissident shareholder groups this is now all behind revlon and the company’s shares have also even been doing quite well up  in the last twelve months certainly rebounding from its state in  when during the depths of the recession revlon had become quite a troubled business revlon posted losses for a number of years after perelman’s original acquisition losing market share to competitors like l’oreal estée lauder and procter  gamble and it suffered under a heavy debt load some of which likely related to the acquisition itself even so a market cap of us  billion on its current price of about us per share is still a substantial company with a widely accepted range of products that are liked by its customers according to some analysts the current share price may be only about  times projected  earnings – compared to an estimated  times for competitors and rivals estée lauder and l’oréal maybe the recent share price uptick reflects hopes of a renewed privatization offer from perelman – only this time one on more transparent

reading the main story photo ronald o perelman last year credit dorothy hong for the new york times less than a year since he stepped down as the chairman of carnegie hall after clashing with its staff ronald o perelman the billionaire businessman announced wednesday that he was donating  million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the world trade center sitehis donation immediately catapulted the longstalled performing arts center one of the last major pieces of unfinished business at the world trade center site from aspirational to achievable and places him among a new generation of power brokers and billionaires who are reshaping — and renaming — the cultural infrastructure of new york in recognition of his gift the new theater complex which will sit on one of the most emotionally resonant and most visited spots in the city will be named for mr perelman“i think that this is a project that must happen” mr perelman said in an interview adding that he had been drawn to it by the vision of the role that art could play at the site of the sept   attacks and in the continuing rebuilding of the area “it is more than just a pure artistic center to serve a community it is that but at the same time it’s much more than that”in the last few years the city’s wealthy elite have chiseled their names into some of the city’s most iconic cultural institutions — or sought to build their own the new york public library’s main branch on fifth avenue has been renamed for stephen a schwarzman the old new york state theater for david h koch and avery fisher nee philharmonic hall at lincoln center for david geffen advertisement continue reading the main story the new perelman center is also joining several other projects that are being planned including culture shed a performance space at the hudson yards on the west side and a new park on pier  near th street with three outdoor spaces underwritten by the billionaire barry diller some arts executives have questioned whether the city had the audiences and donor base to sustain so many new cultural spaces continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but culture has long been envisioned as a key part of the rebuilt world trade center and was an important feature of the architect daniel libeskind’s  master plan for the site the performing arts center was placed on the back burner though as officials wrangled over the many other thorny issues involved in redevelopment groups including the old new york city opera the signature theater company and the joyce theater all explored anchoring the new complex but nothing came of it the architect frank gehry was hired to design it then his design was shelved the project which was championed by the bloomberg administration and eagerly sought by downtown residents was kept alive through the administrations of four governors and two mayorsthe seeds of mr perelman’s involvement were planted a decade ago when michael r bloomberg who was the mayor became the chairman of the national september  memorial and museum to restore confidence in the project which had gone off track mr bloomberg recalled in an interview that one of the first donors he turned to was mr perelman who quickly agreed to donate  million to the museum project mr perelman stayed involved expressing enthusiasm for the idea of a performing arts center at the site and as the project finally took shape recently he agreed to make the lead gift photo a rendering of the future site of the performing arts center at the world trade center credit dbox “perelman’s a funny guy — if he’s interested in the institution and its mission he’s a very easy sell” mr bloomberg said “there have been times i had to sell him when he didn’t care very much and that took a little more work”the backers of the new perelman center downtown see it as filling an important niche for a midsize theater that can accommodate the kinds of multidisciplinary works many artists experiment with today the complex which is being designed by rex a brooklynbased architecture firm is to include three flexible technologically advanced theaters that can individually seat  people  people and  people and which can be combined into one space that can accommodate  the plan calls for the center to present or produce dance concerts new or early chamber opera and theater and to become the main venue of the tribeca film festival each aprilthe performance plans have yet to come fully into focus david lan the artistic director at the young vic in london did a stint as its temporary artistic director and jenny gersten a former executive director of friends of the high line and artistic director of the williamstown theater festival in massachusetts is a producing consultant but the presence of mr perelman a hardcharging businessman who is known to favor a handson approach with groups that he supports suggests that there will be a

left carnegie after spending less than a year as its chairman after clashing with its staff and other board members — and before making an additional donation to the hall that had been expected to be in the  million range he said in the interview that his support of the new performing arts center was unrelated to his departure from carnegie and that he probably would have made the donation to support the new complex in any casewith mr perelman’s donation the project is now well on its way to covering its estimated  million price tag said maggie boepple the center’s president and director the lower manhattan development corporation committed  million in federal funds awarded after the sept  attacks for the project’s design construction and administrative costs“ronald’s gift is going to open the doors” ms boepple said “we have some other donors in the wings” advertisement continue reading the main story mr perelman who raised eyebrows with his call to stage more pop music at carnegie hall said that he envisioned attracting a wide variety of artists “i would hope it is the first venue of choice for the bruce springsteens and the bon jovis and the yoyo mas and the lang langs and at the same time it’s a place where we could have produced a “hamilton” project or where we could produce a new ballet” he said he added that he was excited by the technological possibilities of the plans which call for adding cuttingedge streaming capabilities that will allow the center to capture and disseminate performances in a much more immersive sophisticated way than is done at most theatersmr perelman said that he had been particularly taken by the designs of the architect joshua princeramus who was formerly a partner of rem koolhaas and recalled a recent meeting in which they went over the renderings of the complex which have not yet been publicly released and then discussed the technological possibilities with nicholas negroponte a founder of the mit media lab who had been visiting mr perelman on other businessthe news that the performing arts center finally had a lead gift and was likely to get built is sure to cheer downtown residents who have long seen it as a priority said catherine mcvay hughes the chairwoman of community board  “the community that stayed was steadfast in supporting a cultural component” she said “it was important that something alive gets created here right here at the world trade center site” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go to home page »

company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price in the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into he was first accused of greenmail in late  during a run at cpc international when he bought  of cpc at around  a share and indirectly sold it back to cpc through salomon brothers a month later at  a share for a  million profit both cpc and perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary including what looked like an artificial price increase by salomon shortly before they sold perelmans shares another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the bestknown and stemmed from his attempt to purchase gillette in november  perelman opened negotiations with a bid of  billion gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading perelman accumulated  of gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to gillette later that month for a  million profit gillette had put word out that ralston purina had agreed to buy a  block of stock making any attempt by perelman to buy gillette much more difficult perelman decided to sell his share to

lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would

while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he

in her name she further declared that perelman defrauded the owners of the first sterling corporation ie her by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the companys money and made a very public spectacle of the divorce perelman responded by hiring roy cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations the pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to faith in excess of

perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company

orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make

proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the

visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in

owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started

perelmans company but that he had forwarded lewinskys resume to revlon perelman claims to have been as surprised as anyone when he found out about the lewinsky–clinton connection later that month he found that revlon had already made a job offer which was quickly withdrawn but it was too late revlon and perelman were all over the scandal panavisionedit in april  mf worldwide bought perelmans  stake in panavision for  million this would be unremarkable except that perelman controlled mf worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value at the time mf worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while panavision was bleeding red ink mf worldwides other shareholders cried foul alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was perelman and took their complaints to the courts perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because panavision was wellpositioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography the share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected mf worldwide shareholders lack of confidence perelman tried to pacify mf worldwides shareholders with a  million settlement but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate ultimately perelman agreed to undo the deal fred teppermanedit perelman hired fred tepperman as his cfo after tepperman left warner communications in  starting with pantry pride tepperman worked on every single business deal perelman orchestrated throughout teppermans sevenyear stint at macandrews  forbes teppermans tenure came to an abrupt end just after christmas in  when perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties tepperman had been distracted he claimed by caring for his alzheimersafflicted wife of  years a clause in teppermans contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury albeit psychologically as a result of the effect his wifes condition had on him his demands totaled  million that number stems partially from teppermans salary which started at  and rose to  million in  and partially from his large benefits package perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud claiming that tepperman had sneakily changed the companys retirement plan in such a way that tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars it took over three years for the case to make it to court the case ended with a sealed settlement personal lifeedit marriagesedit perelman has been married five times he married sterling bank heiress faith golding in  and they divorced in  his marriage to gossip columnist claudia cohen lasted from  to  he wed socialite patricia duff in  and divorced in  he was married to actress ellen barkin from  to  on october   perelman married dr anna chapman a harvardeducated psychiatrist faith goldingedit perelman met his first wife faith golding in  while on a cruise to israel as the heir to a fortune made in real estate and banking faith golding controlled a personal fortune of around  million at the time of their marriage they adopted three children named steven josh and hope and faith gave birth to a fourth child named debra their marriage lasted until  when faith discovered perelman was having an affair with a local florist after a bill for a bulgari bracelet was sent to their home instead of perelmans office faith threatened to scuttle perelmans attempt to take macandrews  forbes private in  by staking a claim to a third of it due to a bank loan in her name she further declared that perelman defrauded the owners of the first sterling corporation ie her by buying thousands of dollars of gifts for the florist with the companys money and made a very public spectacle of the divorce perelman responded by hiring roy cohn and flatly denying all of the allegations the pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to faith in excess of  million claudia cohenedit ronald and samantha perelman perelman met his second wife claudia cohen in  at le cirque they had one daughter together samantha in  in august  ron filed for divorce claudia left the marriage with well over  million in  claudia died after a secret sevenyear battle with ovarian cancer perelman revealed during his speech at her funeral that hed known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine as a part of his efforts to cure her in march  perelman decided to change the name of logan hall located at the university of pennsylvania to cohen hall after his late exwife he donated  million to the university to remodel what is now perelman quadrangle and as part of his donation he had the option to change the name of logan hall his decision to rename logan hall dismayed some penn faculty alumni and students patricia duffedit patricia duff was perelmans third wife the pair first met in a paris hotel lobby when both were still married perelman to cohen and duff to mike medavoy after duff divorced medavoy duff converted to judaism and married perelman on january   she gave birth to his fourth daughter caleigh sophia before the wedding took place when the marriage between duff and perelman disintegrated in  custody over caleigh became a major issue both perelman and duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support initially private the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of duff neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed the court psychiatrist found duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and perelman to have serious anger management issues perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about  a day to feed his daughter and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party the judges sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case but its known that neither party actually won perelman is caleighs legal guardian but patricia has extensive visitation rights ellen barkinedit ellen barkin perelman met his fourth wife actress ellen barkin at a vanity fair oscar afterparty in  after slightly more than a year of courtship the two married in june  all accounts indicate their fiveyear marriage was a stormy one much of the friction arose due to barkins acting career and her attendant travel schedule perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early  the press soundly mocked perelman for his actions the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed barkin if he waited a few days longer depending on the source used barkins yearly alimony ranges from  million to  million and the total payout ranged from  million to  million in late  the pair exchanged lawsuits part of the divorce settlement required perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company barkin and her brother george an aspiring screenwriter had started perelman made only one of the payments claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films barkin sued for her money while perelman countersued alleging barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves anna chapmanedit perelman began dating psychiatrist dr anna chapman in mid in august  they announced they are expecting a baby—her first his seventh—via a surrogate in october  they were married chapman is a convert to judaism in late november  the couple celebrated the birth of their son oscar the couple later had a second child in may  judaismedit judaism has had a strong influence on perelmans life he grew up in a conservative household the temple he went to growing up was a reconstructionist temple and his father has donated millions to conservative causes he had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to israel i felt not just this enormous pride at being a jew i felt this enormous void at not being a better jew so i decided then to begin being a better jew as soon as i got married we kept a kosher house we became much more observant we moved to new york shortly thereafter and joined an orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more judaism surrounding them than i ever did today he strictly observes the jewish sabbath spends three hours every saturday in prayer keeps a kosher home and donates millions to jewish groups and causes particularly the chabadlubavitch sect he does not consider himself to be a member of lubavitch he supports them because he thinks they are judaisms best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society homesedit près choisis in  perelman is the owner of
