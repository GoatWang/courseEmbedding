campaign promise and ended the draft no longer would young men find their futures determined by the selective service system nor would the us military have a guaranteed source of recruits america’s army is the story of the allvolunteer force from the draft protests and policy proposals of the s through the iraq war it is also a history of america in the postvietnam era in the army america directly confronted the legacies of civil rights and black power the women’s movement and gay rights the volunteer force raised questions about the meaning of citizenship and the rights and obligations it carries about whether liberty or equality is the more central american value what role the military should play in american society not only in time of war but in time of peace and as the army tried to create a volunteer force that could respond effectively to complex international situations it had to compete with other “employers” in a national labor market and sell military service alongside soap and soft drinks based on exhaustive archival research as well as interviews with army officers and recruiters advertising executives and policy makers america’s army confronts the political moral and social issues a volunteer force raises for a democratic society as well as for the defense of our nation permalink find at a bookstore  seminary coop » powell’s » indiebound »

generalsocial science general share this about this bookabout the authorsreviewstable of contents sex in the heartland is the story of the sexual revolution in a small university town in the quintessential heartland state of kansas bypassing the ofttold tales of radicals and revolutionaries on either coast beth bailey argues that the revolution was forged in towns and cities alike as “ordinary” people struggled over the boundaries of public and private sexual behavior in postwar america bailey fundamentally challenges contemporary perceptions of the revolution as simply a triumph of free love and gay lib rather she explores the longterm and mainstream changes in american society beginning in the economic and social dislocations of world war ii and the explosion of mass media and communication which aided and abetted the sexual upheaval of the s focusing on lawrence kansas we discover the intricacies and depth of a transformation that was nurtured at the grass roots americans used the concept of revolution to make sense of social and sexual changes as they lived through them everything from the birth control pill and counterculture to civil rights was conflated into “the revolution” an accessible but deceptive simplification too easy to both glorify and vilify bailey untangles the radically different origins intentions and outcomes of these events to help us understand their roles and meanings for sex in contemporary america she argues that the sexual revolution challenged and partially overturned a system of sexual controls based on oppression inequality and exploitation and created new models of sex and gender relations that have shaped our society in powerful and positive ways permalink find at a bookstore  seminary coop » powell’s » indiebound »
