manufacturing co site is located on about  acres at  sunset drive previously  sunset drive next to a residential neighborhood in camdenton in  dawson metal products constructed a commercial building at the site and began manufacturing airconditioning coils and feeder parts from aluminum and copper tubing in  sundstrand tubular products bought out dawson and produced aluminum and copper heat transfer units at the facility until  during that time the building underwent four expansions and is currently  square feet the manufacturing process required cutting and expanding aluminum and copper to bond the copper tubing with the aluminum fins a vapor degreasing process was used to remove the oil and dirt from the various parts and assembled units before further processing both dawson and sundstrand used trichloroethylene tce in the vapor degreasers a variety of hazardous wastes were produced as part of the facility operations including corrosive waste wastewater treatment sludge from electroplating operations and residual contaminants associated with the degreasing operations from  to  sundstrand stored the hazardous waste in three hazardous waste container storage areas area  was a  foot by  foot gravel area located outside about 8 feet west of the west wall of the manufacturing building area  operated from  to 8 and stored up to fortyfive gallon drums of liquid waste and sludge at any given time including tce still bottoms waste paint filters and liquid and nonhazardous waste oil area  was graded paved and turned into an employee parking lot in 8 area  was a  foot by  foot concrete slab located outside about  feet west of the west wall of the manufacturing building area  operated from 8 to 8 in addition to storing up to twenty gallon drums the area also contained one gallon waste oil tank and one gallon steel tank that held tce still bottoms area  was a  foot by  foot area located along the south outside wall of the manufacturing building area  operated from  to 8 and reportedly stored gallon drums of waste tce and waste oil from the degreasing operations in 8 area  was removed to make room for a building expansion to the south from  to  both dawson and sundstrand used four cement sumps mud pits for wastewater collection the mud pits located about  feet from the building foundation along the west side of the manufacturing building were  feet by  feet by  feet deep the mud pits received stormwater boiler blowdown and cleaning line water from the manufacturing process each pit was connected to the pit next to it by a inch diameter steel line mud pits  and  collected copper cleaning line waste mud pit  collected aluminum cleaning line waste mud pit  the southernmost mud pit was an open pit that collected boiler water and stormwater the contents of each mud pit flowed into the connected mud pit in sequence from mud pit  to mud pit  the untreated wastewater eventually discharged from mud pit  into the onsite wastewater discharge line which connected to the city of camdenton sewer system along the north side of the manufacturing building the untreated wastewater mixed with sanitary wastes from surrounding residential properties while it traveled to a acre offsite wastewater treatment lagoon known as the hulett lagoon located about onefourth mile to the northeast of the manufacturing building hulett lagoon was operated by the city of camdenton from  to8 the lagoon received stormwater and untreated wastewater from the sundstrand facility other commercial waste streams from the hulett chevrolet buick gmc car dealership and domestic sewage from the surrounding residences in 8 sundstrand removed mud pit  closed the area  hazardous waste container storage area and installed a wastewater pretreatment system over the area sundstrand began using the wastewater pretreatment system in  and stopped discharging untreated waste to the city sewer system in october  modine heat transfer inc a whollyowned subsidiary of modine manufacturing co purchased the property from sundstrand and continued producing aluminum and copper heat transfer units until  modine used trichloroethane tca in the vapor degreasers from  until  and methylene chloride from  until  in april  modine heat transfer inc merged with modine manufacturing co and changed its name to modine manufacturing co in  modine completely renovated the building’s interior as part of a productline change which required replacing all equipment in the plant except the wastewater and electrical systems modine removed the vapor degreasing units and brought all recessed floors to grade in  modine began producing radiators large heat transfer units using a different manufacturing process no chlorinated vapor degreasing was used in the parts cleaning process in february  cla llc purchased the property from modine who inturn sold the property to raasmartin llc modine continued operating at the facility under a lease agreement until  closure and corrective action status details regarding the removal and initial closure activities for the three hazardous waste container storage areas are unknown in september  before modine purchased the site sundstrand submitted a closure plan to the department to close the hazardous waste container storage areas in order to terminate the facility’s interim status classification as a hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facility sundstrand wanted to operate as a hazardous waste generator only modine notified the department and the us environmental protection agency epa of the ownership change in december  according to applicable state and federal hazardous waste laws and regulations modine as the owner of the property at that time was required to investigate and clean up releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents to the environment at their facility resulting from present and past hazardous waste handling practices including releases by previous facility owners in november  law environmental inc performed an environmental site assessment of the facility on behalf of modine sample results showed low levels of volatile organic compounds vocs along the west side of the manufacturing building in the area of hazardous waste container storage areas  and  modine submitted a revised closure plan for the hazardous waste container storage areas in march  which the department approved with modifications in november  the modifications required additional sampling during this same timeframe jacobs engineering group inc performed a visual site inspection and preliminary assessment of the facility on behalf of epa due to a complaint claiming  gallons of tce had been spilled at the facility the assessment was conducted to identify and gather information on actual and potential releases of hazardous waste and hazardous constituents to the environment the  environmental priorities initiativepreliminary assessment epipa report identified six solid waste management units recommended for additional investigation these units included the hulett lagoon mud pits three container storage areas and monorail vapor degreaser and still while modine performed the container storage area closures several investigations were also performed to assess the potential for releases from the solid waste management units recommended for additional investigation most of the units were grouped together by location for investigation and remediation purposes the hulett lagoon and associated wastewater line were located off the modine facility property the mud pits area  and area  were located on the west side of the manufacturing building based on the  sampling results law environmental inc performed a followup investigation in july  during the closure of the container storage areas this investigation was to further assess the presence of tce and related vocs on behalf of modine law submitted a closure report in september  sampling results showed detectable amounts of vocs and lead in the soil the department requested modine perform a risk assessment and additional sampling the august  risk assessment concluded the minimal amounts of vocs in the soil did not pose a health risk and the lead in the soil was not considered a significant health risk however the department required modine to define the extent of contamination to nondetectable levels in order to reach final closure of the container storage areas in  dames  moore performed the required investigation which also included a groundwater investigation on behalf of modine dames  moore submitted a report of its findings to the department in february  sample results showed detectable amounts of tce and other related vocs in and around the employee parking lot and along the buried wastewater discharge line along the west side of the manufacturing building additional groundwater monitoring wells were also installed samples taken during installation showed groundwater contamination was present additional investigation was determined to be needed in november  dames  moore conducted an investigation at the former hulett lagoon to determine whether vocs particularly tce were present in the soil missouri engineering corp a contractor for the city of camdenton originally coordinated the sludge removal from the lagoon during closure activities in july 8 although the closure was approved by the department’s water pollution control program there was no knowledge of contamination at the lagoon at that time and the closure was not designed to meet the requirements of the missouri hazardous waste management law and regulations regarding corrective action sampling results from the  investigation confirmed tce was present in the soil near the former lagoon outfall and near the center of the former lagoon in april  dames  moore conducted a soil investigation under the manufacturing building floor in the area of the monorail vapor degreaser and still and former area  on behalf of modine dames  moore submitted a final report to the department in may  sample results indicated tce was present in the soil east of the former above ground solvent storage tank location and north of the monorail vapor degreaser vocs were also present in the soil beneath the manufacturing building foundation in the area of the former monorail vapor degreaser in september  dames  moore performed an investigation at the mud pits to assess any potential releases on behalf of modine dames  moore submitted a final report to the department in december  sample results showed increasing tce concentrations with increasing depth as a remedial action the soil surrounding mud pits   and  and debris from the mud pits ie cement lining pvc piping and scrap metal were removed in october  about  tons of soil were disposed offsite as hazardous waste and 8 tons were disposed offsite as special waste the areas where vocs were detected above the cleanup goals were limited and in areas difficult to get to for removal removing the soil would have potentially weakened the building foundation or damaged underground utilities such as fire lines in january  tce was discovered in the city of camdentons mulberry well at levels above the maximum contaminant level for drinking water the mulberry well is a city municipal well located about  feet southeast of the modine property and  feet south of the former hulett lagoon a march  investigation confirmed tce from the hulett lagoon was released to the groundwater because the untreated wastewater from the modine property mixed with sanitary wastes from nearby residences in the sewer system on its way to the hulett lagoon legal limitations were imposed on the department’s ability to use hazardous waste authority to investigate the groundwater contamination the groundwater contamination issue was referred to the departments hazardous waste program superfund section under the name hulett lagoon the status of these remedial activities is described below the mulberry well is no longer connected to the citys water supply system and is not used for drinking water in july  modine entered into a corrective action abatement order on consent with the department order no hw the order outlined the framework for a facilitywide investigation to fully define the nature and extent of any contaminant releases to the soil at the modine property and to identify and evaluate possible corrective measures necessary to prevent alleviate or clean up any releases the department’s hazardous waste program permits section is providing oversight of these activities both the modine facility and the former hulett lagoon appear to be contributors to the tce groundwater contamination in the area permits and superfund are closely coordinating all environmental investigation and cleanup activities given the connection between the environmental issues in july  as part of a plant renovation modine removed the onsite wastewater discharge line that connected the mud pits to the city of camdenton sewer system the discharge line ran along the north side of the manufacturing building from the mud pits on the west side of the manufacturing building to the sewer main on the north side soil samples were collected along the base and walls of the foot excavation trench residual tce was detected at one sample location however the amount was far below the epa regional screening level for residential use tce was not detected in any other samples collected along the former wastewater discharge line in october  chm hill was contracted by modine to investigate the extent of tce contamination in the soil west of the manufacturing building near the end of a former stormwater drain line an approximately  square foot area of the parking lot west of the building in the former location of hazardous waste container storage area  was identified as contaminated excavation activities began in october  and included removing about 8 cubic yards of soil as more information became available the amount of impacted soil was more than originally estimated especially to the east and southeast of the known area of impact excavation activities stopped and additional investigations were performed to better understand the extent of impacted soil in  an additional  tons of soil were removed confirmation sample results showed all voc impacted soil was removed to sitespecific cleanup levels which were developed to be protective of groundwater on behalf of modine chm hill performed an indoor air quality assessment for the manufacturing building in march  in order to help the department complete an environmental indicator determination environmental indicator evaluations were developed by epa to measure the progress in protecting human health and the environment at facilities performing environmental cleanups these measures evaluate current environmental conditions and calculate whether people are currently being exposed to environmental contamination at unacceptable levels and whether any existing plumes of contaminated groundwater are expanding stable shrinking or adversely affecting surface water bodies the department was concerned residual voc contamination in the soil or water beneath the manufacturing building or along the west side of the building could be vaporizing and entering the air inside the building sample results showed low voc concentrations in the indoor air below sitespecific screening levels and the lowest osha occupational exposure limit modine continued to monitor the indoor air each year for three years and found no contaminant concentrations above osha occupational exposure limits the voc concentrations were also used to calculate cumulative risks which were determined to be acceptable for an operating facility in  superfund conducted an investigation along the city sewer line between the modine facility and the former hulett lagoon soil sample results confirmed tce was present in the soil along the sewer line and may be a potential source of tce in the mulberry well superfund conducted additional investigation of the groundwater contamination related to this part of the sewer line during this same timeframe chm hill sampled the soil under the manufacturing building on behalf of modine soil borings were advanced beneath the west wall of the manufacturing building at former mud pits  and  a horizontal boring was advanced under the manufacturing building in the area of the former monorail vapor degreaser and still in  additional soil borings were taken through the manufacturing building floor in the area of the former monorail vapor degreaser and still sample results under the manufacturing building showed vocs were below sitespecific screening levels as required by the corrective action order and on behalf of modine chm hill performed a resource conservation and recovery act rcra facility investigation to define the horizontal and vertical extent of any contamination chm hill submitted a rcra facility investigation report to the department and epa in  the report summarized the historical investigations and included both a human health and ecological risk assessment it also evaluated the indoor air against osha occupational exposure limits which are for operating facilities and do not take into account the potential for vapors to enter from beneath the floor before the department would approve the report the department determined additional indoor air investigations were necessary to determine if vocs were vaporizing and entering the manufacturing building in august  indoor and outdoor air samples were collected at the facility the maximum tce concentration was below the screening level based on epa’s preliminary tce toxicity values in march  modine stopped operating and removed all equipment and machinery from the building modine vacated the premises and terminated its lease in late april  in  chm hill submitted to the department a quality assurance project plan on behalf of modine for indoor air and subslab soil gas sampling in the manufacturing building the actual sampling was delayed due to a change in property ownership and technical difficulties with the building’s ventilation system the property went into foreclosure in  the current lienholder is simmons first national bank the facility is currently vacant and property is inactive except for ongoing corrective action activities during this same time period epa released final tce toxicity values which resulted in lower screening levels than were used in the  and  indoor air sampling events in march  chm hill collected subslab soil gas samples beneath the manufacturing building in areas not previously sampled indoor air samples inside the manufacturing building and outdoor air samples just outside the manufacturing building on behalf of modine chm hill submitted a vapor intrusion evaluation summary report to the department in june  sample results showed tce concentrations in the indoor air above the department’s riskbased target level for nonresidential land use and epa’s regional screening level for industrial air tce concentrations in the subslab soil gas were above epa residential and commercial screening levels tce was not detected in the outdoor air sample collected upwind of the building however tce was detected downwind of the building the tce concentrations detected in the outdoor air did not appear to be a source of the measured indoor air concentrations the tce concentrations in subslab vapors were extremely high it was suspected these vapors were entering the manufacturing building and were the main source of the measured indoor air concentrations because of these findings chm hill on behalf of modine performed outdoor soil gas sampling in july and august  on the eastern and northern facility property lines next to the nearby residential areas chm hill submitted a vapor intrusion evaluation summary report to the department in october  sample results showed the maximum tce concentrations in soil gas at the eastern facility property line were above epa residential and commercial screening levels the sampling location was about ten feet west of a residential property and 8 feet south of an existing sanitary sewer line serving the nearby residences tce concentrations in soil gas near the sanitary sewer line on the northern side of the building were above epa residential screening levels the sewer line runs east from the manufacturing building into a sewer tiein drain where it splits north to sunset drive and east to mulberry drive the neighborhood to the east of the facility property the sample results suggested the possibility of tce vapors entering the sewer line or backfill material surrounding the line which could act as a pathway for tce vapors to enter the nearby homes and build up to levels of potential health concern based on these sample results the department requested modine to obtain access to and perform indoor air and subslab soil gas sampling at select homes north of the facility property on sunset drive east of the facility property along mulberry drive and any other nearby homes connected to the sewer line the department also requested modine to collect soil gas samples from the gravel subgrade along the sewer line along the length of mulberry drive and another round of soil gas samples from the previously sampled locations on the facility property quarterly sampling events were conducted at each residence in order to evaluate the potential effects of temperature changes on vapor intrusion the first sampling event occurred in early december  with supplemental sampling conducted in january  indoor air and either subslab or crawl space soil gas samples were collected at each residence where access for sampling had been granted sewer gas samples were collected within the sewer lines soil gas samples were planned in the gravel subgrade along the sewer corridor but were not collected due to heavy rain and water in the sampling ports sample results showed tce concentrations below the epa regional screening level in seven of the ten residences tce concentrations at three residences were above the regional screening level but below the response action level in order to further evaluate the indoor air and potential tce sources a hapsite which is a mobile instrument used to detect vocs was used at the three residences that exceeded the regional screening level tce concentrations exceeded the subslab soil gas screening level at one residence therefore a subslab mitigation system was installed based on the results of the decemberjanuary sampling events the department requested modine expand the residential sampling scope by obtaining access to and performing indoor air and subslab soil gas sampling at select homes north of sunset drive along bent tree lane the next sampling event occurred in march  and included the selected residences along bent tree lane and the residences sampled in december  indoor air and either subslab or crawl space soil gas samples were collected at each residence soil gas samples were collected in the gravel subgrade along the sewer corridor where possible and sewer gas samples were collected within the sewer lines sample results showed tce concentrations above the response action level at one residence on mulberry drive an airpurifying unit was installed at this home and permanent vapor mitigation will be installed quarterly sampling continued in june  september  and december  residences that complete four quarters of indoor air and subslab or crawl space sampling with sample results showing tce concentrations below the response action level are eligible to be removed from the quarterly sampling program modine developed an exit process for those residences as of february  eighteen residences completed the quarterly sampling program regulatory status sundstrand operated three hazardous waste container storage areas under the interim status portions of the federal and state hazardous waste laws  cfr part  and  csr  when congress passed the federal hazardous waste law in 8 all existing facilities treating storing or disposing hazardous waste in a manner that would necessitate obtaining a hazardous waste permit were required to notify epa and apply to get such a permit unless the facility chose to close those operations because of the large number of existing facilities congress set up requirements which allowed these facilities to operate temporarily under “interim status” until they received their permit sundstrand now hamiltonsundstrand submitted their rcra part a permit application for the hazardous waste container storage areas on nov  8 with a revision submitted in 8 a rcra part b permit application was never submitted in september  sundstrand decided not to continue the hazardous waste permitting process and to close the hazardous waste container storage areas sundstrand wanted to operate as a hazardous waste generator only sundstrand and later modine is not subject to the permitting requirements of the missouri hazardous waste management law or federal hazardous and solid waste amendments to rcra for postclosure care because they “clean closed” the interim status hazardous waste management units modine is subject to corrective action because they completed closure of the interim status hazardous waste management units after the effective date of the federal hazardous and solid waste amendments to rcra on july   modine voluntarily entered into a corrective action abatement order on consent
