history  wwwrobertsglorecom skip to main content robglorelasallestcom  philosophywhat sets us apartwhere we investhistoryteamcontact usfaqclients search form search history in  after having built successful careers in the private client and brokerage arms of several wellregarded investment firms including glore forgan loomis sayles and bacon whipple william j o roberts cfa and james d macdonald cic partnered to form their own investment advisory shop which ultimately became known as roberts glore  co   from the outset bill and jd’s aim was to build an advisory firm that provided both clientfocused service and topnotch investment ideas—all at a reasonable cost in the decades that followed their emphasis on highquality investments and attentive service attracted a broad client base encompassing highnetworth individuals and families endowment funds and other institutional accounts across the united states and abroad   during the first decade of the new millennium bill and jd transitioned ownership of roberts glore to their associates clemens p ciupke cpa and jim l calaway cfa cic both of whom had been steeped in the firm’s handson approach to investing since that time our investment team has continued to grow—and client service investment acumen and reasonable costs have remained at the core of our dna     william j o roberts cfacofounder november   – november   bill roberts was the consummate portfolio manager—ever on the hunt for hidden values and dissecting the increasingly complex nuances of the global financial markets bill’s career spanned more than six decades encompassing market booms and busts bubbles and recessions and geopolitical storms of all shapes and sizes he was among the first recipients of the chartered financial analyst designation and a longstanding member of the cfa society of chicago in everything he strove to maintain—and to inspire in those around him—a relentless focus on longterm growth and tax efficiency indeed he brought to his investing career the same vision courage and indomitable spirit that carried him through the dday invasion as a young naval navigator off utah beach   bill retired from roberts glore  co in  astute market timing on his part but his passion for investing and tax matters never faded he frequented the office throughout his retirement years to lend his insight in whatever ways he could even though there was no obligation for him to do so—evidence of his character and his commitment to both our firm and our clients   bill was much more than a portfolio manager however he was an unquenchable and lifelong learner whose interests ranged from economics statistics and the finer points of estate and income tax law to archaeology and the arts his breadth of knowledge was formidable and his love of discovery infectious he traveled extensively his pursuit of learning drawing him across the globe he was also a generous philanthropist and supported endeavors academic artistic and humanitarian above all bill was a man of principal his example of integrity and professionalism will remain a cornerstone of our firm we are profoundly grateful for his wisdom and friendship and we look forward to continuing to expand upon the foundation he worked so hard over many years to build     james d macdonald ciccofounder february   – april   after completing his service as an officer in the us air force in 7 jd macdonald launched his investment career with the storied harriman ripley  co where he developed a keen eye for investment opportunities and a reputation for clientfocused counsel jd subsequently managed van strum  townes chicago office and later moved to loomis sayles  co where he was awarded the chartered investment counselor designation by the investment counsel association of america now known as the investment adviser association in 76 it was also at loomis sayles that he first met bill roberts   that auspicious acquaintance blossomed into a working partnership after jd and bill moved on to bacon whipple  co in the late 7’s while there both men began to suspect that their tailored approach to investment management could be better pursued in an independent environment in  after bacon whipple was bought by another prominent investment house jd and bill saw their opportunity forming the investment advisory firm that would ultimately become known as roberts glore  co   in the years that followed jd successfully guided his clients’ portfolios through bull and bear markets with a consistent focus on longterm value creation at each step of the way he brought to investment management the same traits that marked his life outside the office poise integrity and a dash of style   in  jd entered into a retirement agreement with the remaining partners of roberts glore  co but he continued to play a consultative role to our portfolio managers—a tribute to his commitment to both our team and our clients at the same time retirement gave him greater opportunity to indulge his passions for woodworking world travel and hunting—pursuits whose rigors and rewards incidentally bore a remarkable resemblance to those of investment management we remain indebted to jd for his friendship his counsel and his example of integrity and equanimity in the pursuit of excellence about us our passion is designing and implementing customized investment

skip to main content robglorelasallestcom  philosophywhat sets us apartwhere we investhistoryteamcontact usfaqclients search form search what sets us apart we invest for the long haul   financial fads and market momentum come and go but we believe that the key to successful investing is a steadfast focus on the long term  we have found that the greatest rewards over time come to those who invest with discipline patience and courage and thereby position themselves to exploit the inevitable mood swings of the financial markets   we seek diversification   we work closely with you to determine an appropriate mix of investments for your portfolio taking into account your longterm wealth management goals tax status and risk tolerance  this approach often calls for a blend of asset classes which may include domestic or international equities and fixed income real estatetimber commodities or other alternative assets   diversification does not ensure against market risk special considerations are associated with international investing including the risk of currency fluctuations and political and economic events bonds are subject to market and interest rate risk if sold prior to maturity alternative investment products involve a high degree of risk often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss and can be highly illiquid   we are independent thinkers   we have found that investment success often requires a willingness to stand apart from the crowd—to search for opportunity when others are fearful and to exercise caution when financial markets are euphoric this contrarian bent is seldom easy and never popular in the short run but we have found it to be a compelling strategy for the long run   we take a personalized approach   no two investors are exactly alike and our asset management reflects that fact  we examine your longterm investment goals spending or gifting needs risk tolerance and other financial considerations and build a customized investment portfolio shaped by those inputs of course as your financial needs and goals change over time we adapt accordingly     see also where we

we invest stocks   we seek opportunities to build equity stakes in higherquality companies both in the us and abroad that are still in the growth stage of their operational lifecycle  these companies may be dynamic small or midcap names or wellestablished larger firms with managers who have found innovative ways to stay on top  we prefer to buy stocks when they are out of favor with the investment community—and are therefore trading at what we feel are more reasonable prices this requires discipline patience and courage   in select cases we may also pursue modest stakes in companies with the potential to benefit from a turnaround in operational effectiveness management ownership structure andor market recognition we generally aim to acquire shares in such companies at a discount to our estimate of their fair value moreover we may use lowcost index funds or exchangetraded funds to gain exposure to sectors or countries where we feel longterm valuations appear attractive   our investment approach typically produces an annual turnover rate of roughly  or lower which translates to a holding period of five years or longer on average low turnover is efficient not only from the standpoint of reducing taxes it also lowers transaction costs   investors should consider index and exchangetraded funds’ investment objectives risks charges and expenses carefully before investing the prospectus which contains this and other important information is available from your financial advisor and should be read carefully before investing   bonds   our approach to bond selection hinges on your tax situation and income needs  we tend to buy shorttointermediateterm bonds with an eye to holding them to maturity  generally our preference is for the highest quality investmentgrade bonds including highgrade corporate credit municipal bonds both taxexempt and taxable as appropriate us agency issues and traditional or zerocoupon us treasury issues  at times we also make use of treasury inflation protected securities “tips” or other inflationindexed bond instruments which help to mitigate inflation’s impact on a bond portfolio’s principal value   when we feel potential interest rate trends warrant it we are willing to invest in intermediate to longerduration bond holdings we may also employ select foreign sovereign debt instruments to capture attractive inflationadjusted yields and guard against weakness in the us dollar moreover we may invest in lowcost bond index vehicles or actively managed bond mutual funds to gain diversification and balance where appropriate   bonds are subject to market and interest rate risk if sold prior to maturity bond values and yields will decline as interest rates rise and bonds are subject to availability and change in price   alternative assets   we search for opportunities to invest in asset classes that exhibit low or negative correlations to traditional stocks or bonds and thus have the potential to enhance your portfolio’s riskreturn profile such investments may include timber commodityrelated vehicles real estate or other alternative assets we look for investments with reasonable costs and compelling longterm dynamics and we place an emphasis on publicly marketable securities   alternative investment products involve a high degree of risk often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss and can be highly illiquid     see also what sets us apart about us our passion is designing and implementing customized investment
