before the company can ever turn pebbles mineral riches into cash flow for shareholders northern dynasty minerals also would need to repartner the project so it has the money to help finance development furthermore it needs to reposition the project to regain public support in the meantime it has a slew of permits studies and other agreements to complete before it can start construction  which if everything goes according to plan wouldnt begin until  that would put the company on pace to start producing from the mine in  now what northern dynasty minerals believes it is sitting on the largest untapped deposit of copper and gold in the world however getting to that buried treasure has proven to be excruciatingly challenging while the project is starting to move in the right direction it will be years before investors see tangible value in the form of production and cash flow this stock remains nothing more than a vehicle for traders hoping to earn a big payday should the
