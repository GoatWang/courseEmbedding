her banking career with chemical bank in new york elaine b agather has carved out an impressive path in those early days in the big apple she stuck out more for her texas drawl than her gender agather

agather  years of power banking she’s been through no fewer than eight corporate mergers–and weathered them all now as chairwoman of the dallas region for jpmorgan chase bank elaine agather is showing why it’s no contradiction for resiliency drive and smarts to come wrapped in a chic package by mary candace evans published in d ceo july  sms cowgirl chic elaine agather the rodeoloving chairwoman of jpmorgan chase bank’s dallas region advises upcoming bankers to saddle their own horses and enjoy what they’re doing photography by dan sellers her perfectly manicured hands manage assets worth billions of dollars at a bank with a year legacy of serving the ultrarich but don’t think she’s all pinstripe banker’s grey elaine agather chairwoman of the dallas region for jpmorgan chase bank is a dynamo wrapped in pink a cross between legally blonde’s elle woods and miranda priestly in the devil wears prada in fact there’s a widespread story—not true she protests—that when prada was released agather handed out copies of the movie to her employees as a joke maybe the story gained currency because like priestly agather’s a perfectionist about serving her clients maybe it’s because her employees know that at any banksponsored event for those clients they’d better not talk to each other but focus instead—totally focus—on the clients maybe it’s because that event had better be damn interesting entertaining and finished in a timely fashion so those clients—some of the southwest’s wealthiest who seek advice  on everything from taxes and real estate to oil and gas leases—can get in and out with the vital information they need then again maybe it’s because agather’s a beautiful blonde who always dresses to the nines and wears a lot of prada “she wears the best clothes” says darin oduyoye chief communications officer for jpmorgan private bank in new york who sees beautiful women in fashionable clothes every day “she was wearing a pink leopardskin jacket and pink heels the last time she was here” agather is tough energetic and chic all wrapped in one glamorous package but don’t let the wrapper fool you she can play hardball and skirmish with the big boys in banking just fine as she has for  years “she’ll put on her jeans and hang out with the guys” says gary tipton president and ceo of dallas’ inwood national bank “but no one pushes her around” especially not when she’s wearing cowboy boots agather has ridden on horseback in the “grand entry” at the fort worth exposition and stock show every year since  she loves rodeo because it’s pure fun she says and serves on the advisory board of the national cowgirl museum and hall of fame ten years ago agather was asked to raise  million to  million to help relocate the museum from hereford texas to fort worth she wound up raising  million for a new facility which opened in  agather’s ability to stay in the saddle may help explain her other claim to fame her resiliency in business few people in the tumultuous watchyourback world of corporate banking and finance can say they’ve been with their first employer for  years but agather has topped that surviving eight potential golden handshakes during that time over the last  years us banks have been so busy acquiring and consolidating consumers can have a hard time keeping up with the hyphenated names much less remembering which bank was the first to megamerge with the rest but agather rattles off her employer’s history as smoothly as she quotes today’s prime rate first it was chemical bank of new york where she began working in  after graduating with an mba from the university of texas at austin business school just  percent of her fellow grads that year were women chemical bank bought texas commerce bank in  then snapped up first city the second time it failed after that it gobbled up manufacturers hanover ameritrust part of m bank and finally chase in  taking on the chase name two years later in  the stately chase bought storied jpmorgan with william b harrison at its helm in  chase went shopping in chicago and acquired bank one headed by james dimon legend has it that harrison and dimon—who became ceo in  and recently orchestrated the acquisition of the ailing bear stearns investment bank at firesale prices—wanted to create another citigroup to take on that trilliondollar behemoth with every merger of course comes the slashing and mad dash to see who’s staying and who’s out the door but it didn’t used to be that way—at least not in dallas inwood’s tipton remembers “gentlemanly” banking in dallas in the late s when no bank would dare hire another’s employees tipton even recalls receiving phone calls from fellow bankers alerting him to a peeved client who was about to yank deposits to a competing bank but then came the great regulatory unleashing to foster competition with the jpmorgan chasebank one merger for example about  jobs were reported eliminated from top to bottom  but agather lived through all of it working  years in corporate banking— in private banking—to end up where she is today perched on the sleek fineartfilled th floor of  ross ave as chairwoman of the substantially growing dallas region agather is helping build wealth for rich people living in texas as well as in louisiana arkansas and oklahoma last year under agather jpmorgan chase’s dallasregion business grew  percent in a company with  billion in total client assets almost every banker who knows her has this to say elaine agather really runs the joint “elaine takes ownership of her job” says tipton “she services her clients she’s approachable does the followthrough and makes everyone feel special” michael walsh who heads jpmorgan’s private bank southeast region says that agather’s “eq”—or emotional intelligence quotient—is off the charts but don’t let her southern charm fool you walsh adds a tough businesswoman who can get the deal done lies just beneath still agather knows how to laugh and how to bring fun and camaraderie to an office consider the times she dressed up as the easter bunny and as banker jp morgan when you’re leading a team of highly motivated people who share a keen sense of urgency you need a little stress relief now and then says anne motsenbocker president of jpmorgan’s dallas region who’s worked with agather for more than  years “she expects people around her to perform” motsenbocker says of agather “but she expects so much out of herself and has a huge amount of energy and drive that creatively marshals jpmorgan’s resources”  though agather launched her career in new york she ironically ended up back home in texas just a few miles from the small town where she got the very best training a modern banker could ask for get up early stay late and work hard ‘i so should have taken ‘home ec’ ’it was  in sherman texas and elaine bradley was  in her junior high school girls had to take home economics classes to learn to cook sew tend the house and otherwise prepare to be sensible homemakers gloria steinem wouldn’t snag a headline until more than four years later when women would burn bras to protest their stereotypical roles as homemakers and demand a crack in the glass ceiling elaine wasn’t burning anything she was just mad that boys didn’t have to take “home ec” while girls did it’s just not fair she said although she did her share of housecleaning with her sisters because that’s what was expected she went to her mother seeking an ally—which to her surprise she got “i was the fourth daughter i think she was just tired” agather says “she intervened and they let me take french instead of home ec i so should have taken home ec” agather was reared in sherman the youngest daughter of george and lorene bradley her father operated a bulldozer after receiving an th grade education her mother was a deft seamstress and homemaker elaine was always working—teaching swimming lessons wrapping gifts at a sherman jewelry store called tappans those jobs she says gave her selfesteem early while her family was always supportive and had no doubt that young elaine could stop a tornado if she put her mind to it “my parents were very modern in their thinking” agather says “i’m not even sure my father understood what graduate business school was but after i finished college and told him what i was doing he said ‘great’” back in the late s the big banks weren’t on campus recruiting mbas in austin but agather had her eyes on the big apple where there were more women in banking and banking management than in all of texas graduate degree in hand she went to new york city in  to interview at chemical bank she got an offer and ran to a pay phone at fifth and th street to call home—collect “i said ‘i just got a job offer in new york at chemical bank’ ” agather recalls well her father teased her “does that mean now you’ll stop calling home collect” ditch the ‘übersensitivity’agather had been in new york for just a few weeks when her boss called her into his office and told her that he needed an analyst in london and just like that she was living and working in england women agather says tend not to be good risk takers they don’t like to lurch forward or raise their hands in contrast to men who always forge ahead working as an analyst in great britain she says tripled her confidence not that london had been in her playbook in fact elaine didn’t have a playbook “i’ve never really had a career track” she says “i was always so happy doing what i was doing and so focused i never sought out other jobs”  which might be why they came to her when her bossed called and said “ok now we need you in san francisco” agather saddled up again too often she says people spend so much time worrying about their next step they can’t focus on the present saddle your own horse she advises like what you’re doing and do it “tremendously” agather credits much of her success to the mentors she’s had—many of them men—who’ve given her tough feedback and honest opinions and she’s taken it all in stride “i’ve had men who’d name my outfits ‘peptobismol pink’” she says “i’m called ‘honey’ all the time and it doesn’t bother me one bit” pack a walloping sense of humor and solicit regular feedback from your mentors agather advises but don’t cry if you don’t like what you hear the minute you cry she says the feedback will end it’s a healthy exercise for women to listen to how men talk to each other and to ditch the “übersensitivity” she goes on—and it’s best if they learn that early in their careers agather currently manages about  people for chase in dallas many of them women who find her a tough taskmaster those luncheon napkins they’d best be in the right place on the table and male or female you’d better not cry over a missed deadline or negative feedback “ that you cry about” she says “i want people who can handle the market falling and not fall apart themselves” no ‘banker’s hours’it was  and elaine was thinking for a nanosecond that it might be nice to go home to texas then a watershed event occurred “we’re going to open an office in texas” her boss announced faster than you can spur a horse to run agather was living in dallas chemical bought texas commerce bank in  and in  agather moved to fort worth to be the bank president nine months later texas commerce’s chairman left and agather was not only back in texas she was in charge and riding herd as chairwoman in  she married neils agather with whom she’d worked at chemical they’ve now been married for  years have two daughters and are all accustomed to elaine’s grueling hourplus workdays the antithesis of “banker’s hours”  “i missed those” agather says with a laugh “must have been back in the ’s” she starts each workday with a  am meeting—a “global hookup” on market conditions with jpmorgan private bankers from paris texas to paris france by  she’s calling on clients by phone or meeting customers in person working emails or “walking” the office later hours find her studying the numbers or dealing with management issues she rarely eats lunch by herself usually dining with a client or calling on a prospect in the afternoon she spends more time with her employees much of it in conference calls and continues catching up with communications “i cannot remember when i’ve had a couple of hours to sit at my desk” she says “unless it was a bank holiday”  in addition there are myriad “opportunities” presented to clients to keep them informed—after all these are customers with net worths of  million or more the opportunities range from wealthplanning seminars on forming family trusts to jpmorgan’s annual summer reading list that list which agather enthusiastically promotes features books recommended by the bank’s global client advisers on topics ranging from art wine and history to business and finance titles on this year’s list include adrian goldsworthy’s caesar and mira kamdar’s planet india how the fastestgrowing democracy is transforming america and the world three out of five nights a week agather also has a reception or other event to attend that might involve a client or one of the many philanthropies the bank supports when all that’s finished she’s at home being a mother some days she says she’s a good banker and a great mother others she’s a great banker and a lousy mother she doesn’t cook but calls husband neils executive director of the fort worthbased burnett foundation a “fabulous” chef agather also doesn’t sew which she lamented one day to her mother years after wriggling out of that home ec class there are things you taught me she told her mom with a sigh that i’ll never be able to teach my girls not to worry her mother replied you’ll teach them other things and she has her “great” daughters are extremely selfsufficient agather says for example they’ve been scheduling their own doctor’s appointments since the age of  when they reminded their mother they hadn’t visited a dentist in more than a year which may be why agather finds it amazing that some of her daughters’ friends have mothers who all but breathe for their children doing things for them like homework and even making their hair appointments for the senior prom let those girls go on to become bankers under agather though and they’ll grow up in a hurry big girls don’t cry they’ll learn big girls are resilient

wellbornphotography by dan sellers thriving on growth women play key roles here with aggressive major banks  by mary candace evans elaine agather isn’t the only powerhouse female banker in dallasfort worth julia wellborn has overseen the explosive growth of charlotte ncbased wachovia bank in this market and with the help of commercialbanking guru kathleen gibson new yorkbased citibank is hiring aggressively here wellborn a yearold atlanta native came to dallas  months ago to run wachovia as the bank’s regional president for north texas but these days all anyone seems to ask her about is real estate in particular that tony little corner at preston road and mockingbird lane where experts say wachovia is paying just under  a year to lease the land under its new highland park branch bank wellborn is steering one of the newest and most aggressive banks in town after wachovia came to dallas “starting from scratch”  months ago “we did not inherit a branch network from a series of mergers” she says if it seems there are more banks than churches or gas stations in dallas it’s partly because  percent of dfw residents now live within  minutes of a wachovia office—all thanks to wellborn “as far as we know” she says “no other bank has come in with a ‘build it from the ground up strategy’ as we did”  wellborn worked with the city of dallas on the architecture of the prestonmockingbird branch the aesthetic goal to make it congruent with pictureperfect highland park village a stone’s throw across the street in working with the community newcomer wellborn says she fell in love with dallas and the city’s accepting spirit  “dallas has a culture of accepting you at face value” she says “it doesn’t matter if you are a martian or a bear if you come here and do something great people love you for it” one example a stranger she met at a highland park football game wrote down a full page of every service she and her family would possibly need unsolicited big d she says is a great place to be a female banker “this is dallas where women like annette strauss and laura miller were mayors and role models” she adds it was the female mentors in wellborn’s own life who taught her that femininity has a place in the business world as does a certain amount of imperfection she considers herself a “servant leader” to her employees it’s her job wellborn says to help others get their jobs done “i am happiest taking someone with an incredible amount of raw talent and helping them succeed” in the sweet spotgibson  is a top executive at the world’s largest financial services company with a territory stretching from texas through chicago and covering more than  customers—but she doesn’t carry checks instead she moves money with her cellphone utilizing an integrated mobile money transfer service called citi obopay gibson moves funds through her phone from her checking account to inlaws say or to reimburse a friend for lunch obopay is one of the latest tech tools from the citi folks who were among the first to bring us atms early s hour atms late ’s and clicktopay credit cards gibson president of commercial banking in the central us region for citibank loves keeping ahead of the tech curve and thriving in the sweet spot of growth texas with its central location great transportation and low costs of living and labor she says the lone star state has surpassed california as the nation’s no  exporting state with diversified exports from goods to services and with the rising tide of international business conducted in north texas on a daily basis gibson sees the caching that growth can bring to citibank never mind what you’ve read in the media about  job cuts at citibank she says in texas under the leadership of gibson and her colleagues the bank is hiring and has hundreds of jobs available gibson may be in the best place to weather the nation’s economic storm but the am graduate has her challenges managing  employees opportunity is worldwide she needs to attract train and retain the talent to help a depositor figure out how to expand his business in china for example the role of a leader gibson says is not to tell experienced people what they need to be doing to instigate that growth but to remove the barriers that get in their way “i surround myself with good leaders” she says “they tell me they want to engage with someone who is getting things done” gibson’s best feedback though comes from her team when they tell her “you get it” after more than  years in commercial and corporate banking and asset management gibson should “get it” she took her knocks in the s along with everyone else in the field then survived the “bankerswillbeextinct” phase when online banking was the craze as a result she
