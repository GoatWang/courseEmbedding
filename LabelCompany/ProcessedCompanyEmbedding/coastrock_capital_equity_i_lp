driven longshort equity strategy that focuses on maximizing risk adjusted returns while remaining market neutral the firm aims to generate additional alpha by supplementing its longshort strategy with an options component for special situations and during certain cycles of the calendar year coastrock actively manages both portfolio and operational risk in several ways including risk budgeting and hedging when appropriate   coastrock founded by peter hamamji began the development of its investment strategy in  and is continuously creating and improving new and existing models coastrock’s strategy focuses on leveraging software data and quantitative analysis to attempt to predict future price movements of the stock market quantitative models are developed inhouse and range from fundamental and technical analysis to machinelearning algorithms   the manager is currently focusing on generating a strong track record and expects to raise additional capital once the fund completes its first year while coastrock has a limited track record its investment strategy and models have been thoroughly tested through several market environments given the fund’s quantitative nature a
