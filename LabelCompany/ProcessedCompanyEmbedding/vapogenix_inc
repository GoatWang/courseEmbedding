based on formulated volatile anesthetics    ﻿﻿rapidly acting topical analgesic﻿﻿vapogenix’s first product is a rapidly acting topical analgesic to alleviate pain associated with venipuncture venous cannulation and minor dermatological procedures  topical analgesics are used on hospitalized children prior to venous access procedures and by dermatologists to prevent pain associated with both aesthetic and medical procedures  most such products are based on lidocaine and are slow to penetrate skin – onsets of action range from  minutes to  minutes depending on the product  a faster acting topical product would benefit patients who would save time and stress waiting for current products to work and greatly improve productivity of hospital staff and dermatology practices  over time additional indications covering other conditions benefiting from a quick acting topical analgesic will be developedwound painchronic wounds in particular are highly painful and while various products are currently used to alleviate pain few if any are highly effectiveinflammatory paininflammation is associated with many painful conditions both acute and chronic  vapogenix’s products will be aimed at conditions where inflammatory pain is localized create a free website powered by ✕ management team home about pipeline team management team board of directors advisors contact news tackling pain
