resentment  toward candace krugman beineckeas ms beinecke she is a highly regarded corporate lawyer with bluechip clients like viacom the entertainment giant and pricewaterhousecoopers the accounting megalosaur as mrs beinecke she has married into a family of great wealth and position who give to the arts the environment andover and yaleit gets worseshe is naturally thin and never exercisesshe doesnt need a lot of sleepshe doesnt look her age 5she remembers to send thankyou notes  her penmanship is clean and elegant  and has taught her two sons the importance of doing so advertisement continue reading the main story do we hate her yet no wait heres the killerher own relatives and inlaws love one another so much that they vacation together even when shes not on the trip continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but in person ms beinecke is difficult to growl at for she turns out to be possessed of a lowkey charm and approachable warmth those qualities as well as her prodigious work habits helped insure that the recent vote by the executive committee of hughes hubbard  reed to name her its new chair the firms term was unanimous ambitious female lawyers take heart while ms beinecke is the first woman no kidding to lead a major new york law firm she got there by being good at what she does and apparently by not creating a welter of competitive jealousy among the male and female partners she surpassedms beinecke advises female lawyers in particular to develop their own style and not mimic role models dont wear someone elses clothes if they dont fit she said i tried on several when i was starting out i looked at big brash bullying types and tried yelling and screaming she rolled her eyes she is soft spokeni had a brief phase of wearing corporatelooking suits i even tried wearing very short skirts i had no idea what i was doingeventually she settled on an untraditional look yesterday in her office overlooking new york harbor she was wearing navy gabardine pants heels with ankle straps a glass necklace and matching earrings of surprisingly vivid hues and an applegreen blazer there was nothing corporatelooking about this quintessentially corporate lawyerand she has occasionally taken an untraditional approach in negotiating rooms relying on gentle charm to defuse tension during a volatile session involving a halfbilliondollar acquisition ms beineckes client the buyer insisted that the seller agree to ongoing liability insurance the angry seller packed up his papers saying i cant let my

beinecke replied with a light laugh oh please let me be one of those children her client turned ashen but the seller chortled and sat back down at the tableclients say her charm is a cloak for a tenacious imaginative negotiator even when she has bested her opponents she leaves a residue of good will in 8 when sumner m redstone made a competitive and ultimately successful bid to take over her client viacom she was tough fair and she listened said philippe dauman viacoms deputy chairman and executive vice president the new team swept out most of the old team but kept her and her firmms beinecke who has been with the lawyer firm since graduating from rutgers law school said that as a baby lawyer she assumed she would become a litigator fighting for clients in court but she discovered that she preferred corporate practice giving legal and financial advice to clients on reorganization divestiture acquisition advertisement continue reading the main story clients came to know me and appreciate that i would kill myself for them she said geniallyin  when she entered the job market women were asked by prospective employers whether they could handle the demanding hours of a corporate practice as well as family responsibilities these days the question is not raised but the issue remains although hughes hubbard is known as a good place for women to practice  it has flextime arrangements and a fifth of its partners are women  ms beinecke did come up the hard way working endless hours and taking a first maternity leave of only two monthsthere were many nights when i wasnt home and i would have loved more time with my kids she said but you teach by example my sons understand that its exciting to be engaged and involved in work and they learned how to have dinner at  pmshe grew up in paterson nj where her father practiced law and her mother who was known professionally in the 4s as tippie taylor a radio host but privately as sylvia altschuler encouraged her to be a lawyerin terms of credibility ms beineckes biggest obstacle perhaps has not been her sex but her status as mrs beinecke the wife of frederick beinecke a scion of a great family yes as in that yale library there are boards that need attending to benefits to grace households to runpeople say to me why do you do this  she saidshe manages by being a perfectionist who is hyperorganized all the hangers in her closet match her selfcontrol is present in her personal as well as her professional life she can walk into an antiques store desire a choice piece of 8thcentury english furniture and
