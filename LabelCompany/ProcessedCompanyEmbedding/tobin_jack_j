marks given at the rd acs national meeting san francisco april     the priestley address of  priestley medalist tobin j marks given at the rd acs national meeting san francisco april     let me begin by saying how honored i am to be selected as this year’s priestley medalist and to join the distinguished cohort of previous medalists i also wish to salute this year’s acs national award winners an impressive group of chemists and accomplishments congratulations in this address i would like to share a story with you part biographical part scientific and part philosophical relating something of my career how that is intertwined with the science i have done and am currently doing where it is going and lastly how it relates to the question of what chemistry is all about my grandparents on both sides emigrated from czarist russia and came to america for freedom and a better life i was fortunate to grow up in the washington dc area in arlington va and bethesda md in a family having a deep respect for learning hard work and service like many of my generation dynamic science teachers highly motivated classmates and sputnik kindled my fascination with science i owned a gilbert chemistry set and tinkered with explosives and rockets which i’m sure horrified my normally tolerant parents i was fascinated with what things are made of and how that affects their properties on graduating from high school in bethesda i entered the university of maryland which always has had excellent science and engineering programs i chose chemistry as a major partly because of my fascination with what things are made of and how to make them i also took excellent physics and math courses and like all chemistry majors then german language courses there was great camaraderie among the “terp” university of marylandchemistry majors and it seemed that the more noxious the odors emanating from a lab experiment the more we relished it possibly because students majoring in other subjects were repelled we realized how much we were learning and how much we enjoyed laboratory work and we were thrilled i vividly remember one of my classmates pronouncing “chemistry is my religion” which captures some of that slightly wacky sentiment enlarge marks with his research group in the late s credit courtesy of tobin marks   marks with his research group in the late s credit courtesy of tobin marks enlarge marks with his current research group credit mitch jacobycen   marks with his current research group credit mitch jacobycen there was a generally goodnatured rapport between professors and students in that era and i learned that each professor has a different lecturing and teaching style and that in itself was good for me i vividly remember that a physics professor’s humorous request that the chemistry majors in the lecture hall erase the large blackboards was met with goodnatured hisses and boos from the chemistry majors after which we came to the front and dutifully erased the blackboards of course we eventually got to know all of the maryland chemistry faculty and felt unique as “chem majors” with determination and diligence most of us traversed the great divide between physicalchemistryoriented freshman chemistry and phenomenology structure and mechanismoriented organic chemistry chemistry majors had laboratory courses most weekday afternoons and sometimes on saturdays so we felt comfortable in the laboratory a transformative experience at maryland was the national science foundationfunded summer undergraduate research program which allowed us to work in a professor’s laboratory with a modest stipend most exhilarating for me was working with a young inorganic chemistry professor samuel grim synthesizing organophosphorus compounds and measuring their nmr parameters i learned to work and think independently and to appreciate the power of “justintime learning” meaning that when a puzzling result stares you in the face the urgency of trying to understand it and planning what to do next greatly accelerates the learning process enlarge undergraduate research at the university of maryland goggles lifted for the photographer credit courtesy of tobin marks   undergraduate research at the university of maryland goggles lifted for the photographer credit courtesy of tobin marks to me the graduate students in the grim group were stimulating fun people and although i didn’t quite understand who postdocs were they were also impressive from this experience i yearned for more research inorganic chemistry was taught by james huheey and his crystalclear lectures kindled new interests leading me to borrow sam grim’s copy of the landmark cotton and wilkinson inorganic textbook i was entranced by the chemistry the vast periodic table offered and attending graduate school was my ambition the honors chemistry program at maryland required a written senior thesis and original research proposal both to be defended before a faculty committee the former task was straightforward because i had coauthored several publications by then and the latter sent me exploring new literature what captivated me was rowland pettit’s report that the elusive cyclobutadiene molecule could be stabilized by coordination to an iron carbonyl fragment the ramifications of that chemistry formed the basis of my proposal which emerged from the oral defense unscathed and stoked my interest in the organicinorganic chemistry interface indeed unusual interfaces between dissimilar substances continue to intrigue me every time i climb the steps at the massachusetts ave entrance to mit the adrenaline pumps as it did the first time when i entered graduate school as an nsf predoctoral fellow the worldclass mit inorganic group consisted of al cotton alan davison dick holm and dietmar seyferth with george whitesides closely associated it had great intellectual power and breadth i joined al cotton’s group because of his infectious enthusiasm and interesting projects on stereochemically nonrigid organometallic molecules mit housed essentially all science and engineering in one giant complex of interconnected buildings so in addition to chemistry coursework i attended lectures and seminars in other departments and crossregistered at harvard university for william lipscomb’s famous chemical bonding course mit provided an extremely stimulating environment filled with scientific leaders and a warm cotton group camaraderie al gave me the freedom to sample this environment broadly for which i will be forever grateful after initial research speed bumps where difficultly synthesized new molecules turned out to be completely rigid my persistence bolstered by al’s and george’s good advice paid off i enjoyed mentoring our research group’s junior members and vowed to create such an environment when i had my own research group at maryland i was an acs student affiliate at mit i became a full acs member and i recently celebrated my th anniversary enlarge figure    figure  my quest for an academic position took me to us regions i had never visited before including northwestern university which on the day i visited was  °f with a  mileperhour wind all science and engineering was housed in one large building and i found the chemistry department to be researchintense collegial and wellequipped the inorganic group and associated faculty fred basolo  priestley medalist  acs president jim ibers ralph pearson duward shriver and brian hoffman were worldclass and i happily joined as an assistant professor i soon had my laboratory in place with enthusiastic graduate and undergraduate students but what research to do an empty canvas awaited my brush although i could not forget my organometallic roots i was inspired by george whitesides’ advice to strike boldly into new fields to push the frontiers to my thinking the f elements lanthanides and actinides offered untapped possibilities in that their properties differed radically from transition metals for example larger ionic radii different bonding and we set off to explore the chemistry of unknown metalalkyl and metalhydride bonds my first nsf proposal was successful although similar to what bob langer told us in his  priestley address one reviewer was critical to the point of irrationality undeterred we forged ahead and soon could tell the world about remarkable new families of alkyls aryls acyls tetrahydroborates alkane activation products and hydrides as well as evidence for fleeting formyl πolefin πalkyne πarene and h complexes figure  one striking characteristic of these complexes was their extraordinarily high reactivity and catalytic activity versus that of their closest transitionmetal analogs we next extended this work to organolanthanides and again struck gold enlarge figure  credit courtesy of tobin markscen   figure  credit courtesy of tobin markscen invaluable collaborations to more deeply understand molecular and electronic structure with roald hoffmann of cornell university andrew streitwieser ken raymond and dick andersen of the university of california berkeley victor day of the university of nebraska ignazio fragalá of the university of catania herbert schumann of the technical university of berlin geoffrey cloke of sussex university and jack williams and lester morse of argonne national laboratory greatly enriched this field we wondered what other unusual transformations could take place around large actinide centers and for example found that in the presence of the uranyl ion uo condensation reactions that normally produce porphyrinlike metal phthalocyanine complexes—robust pigments used in blue jeans and auto paints we’ll return to them later—instead yield unusual expanded uranylencapsulated metallomacrocycles figure  analogous porphyrinic complexes now play a major role in photodynamic cancer therapy enlarge northwestern university’s ipatieff professors of catalytic chemistry credit courtesy of tobin marks   northwestern university’s ipatieff professors of catalytic chemistry credit courtesy of tobin marks as we explored felement catalytic chemistry the enormous reaction rates intrigued us if kinetics were not limiting but only thermodynamics were could we discover new catalytic transformations using bond energy information fortunately stimulated by the work of jack halpern and later john bercaw bob bergman carl hoff and others we had already constructed sophisticated calorimetry equipment and were in a position to address these questions our bond enthalpy data provided new perspectives on the relative energetics of various metalligand bonds as a function of location in the periodic table differences can be dramatic but also clues to designing new catalytic transformations enlarge figure    figure  combining exploratory chemistry with reaction mechanism analysis we showed that hydroelementation processes involving heteroatomh addition to carboncarbon unsaturation are mediated by organolanthanides and later other metal centers to effect rapid hydroamination hydrophosphination hydroalkoxylation hydrosilation and hydrothiolation reactions of significant scope figure  moreover many of these processes could be coupled to polymerizations to create heteroatomfunctionalized polyolefins in recent work we coupled the microscopic reverse of homogeneous olefin hydroalkoxylation with tandem heterogeneous hydrogenation to hydrogenolyze c–o functionalities of the type found in biomass feedstocks during these times i was also fascinated by the multifaceted role of metal ions “in biology and with jim ibers launched a synthetic spectroscopic and xray diffraction study to understand the molecular and electronic structures of the thenmysterious “blue” copper proteins using pyrazolylborate ligands to simulate the proposed multiimidazole metal binding sites in the actual proteins our students prepared very thermally labile facsimile complexes with most of the correct protein spectroscopic signatures—a significant advance at that time later and of a more organometallic flavor i was intrigued by reports that metallocene complexes of the type chmx where m  ti zr v mo and x  halide were potent antitumor agents in mice our question was whether the carcinostatic activity mechanism was similar to that established by steve lippard for cisplatin involving key binding to specific dna sequences we launched detailed spectroscopic and xray crystallographic studies of chmxaqueous interactions with oligonucleotides and whether chmxaqueous inhibited the cleavage of small circular doublestranded dnas by restriction endonucleases in the manner of cisplatin our search for nonlabile dnametallocene coordination chemistry was inconclusive however we found that these metallocenes do inhibit certain important dna processing enzymes implicating a different anticancer mechanism when i arrived northwestern had a worldrenowned heterogeneous catalysis group founded when the distinguished russian chemist vladimir ipatieff fled the soviet union in  to be jointly professor of chemistry at northwestern and director of research at nearby universal oil products ipatieff received many international recognitions among them the  acs willard gibbs medal and with faculty member herman pines developed a catalytic process for highoctane aviation fuel helping the uk’s royal air force win the  battle of britain i am honored to now occupy ipatieff’s chair in the late s i became intrigued with reports that chemisorption of simple and catalytically marginal earlytransitionmetal organometallic complexes on relatively mundane oxide surfaces such as dehydroxylated alumina da yielded mysterious surface species that were highly active olefin hydrogenation and polymerization catalysts in collaboration with bob burwell who had the necessary catalytic equipment we established that when adsorbed on da chcmch m  th u and related zrmethyl complexes hydrogenated simple olefins at rates comparable to supported platinum metals and rapidly polymerized ethylene kinetic poisoning experiments established that only about  of these surface complexes were catalytically significant not uncommon in heterogeneous catalysis furthermore highresolution crosspolarizationmagicangle spinning cpmas solidstate nmr argued that the active species were formed when lewis acid sites on the da surface abstracted a methide anion from the metal center yielding for zr a formal electron d cation when i proposed this structure at an acs meeting it was met with skepticism but what else could cause such enormous enhancements in catalytic activity enlarge figure  credit courtesy of tobin markscen   figure  credit courtesy of tobin markscen at this time i was collaborating with jim stevens of dow chemical the industrial and academic communities were ablaze with excitement when walter kaminsky of hamburg university reported that illdefined partially hydrolyzed trimethylaluminum species mao somehow activated organozirconium complexes to form potent and equally illdefined homogenous olefin polymerization catalysts what chemistry gave rise to such species we quickly established that the cpmas nmr spectra of evaporated maozirconacene solutions were virtually identical to the same zirconacenes on da for unambiguous characterization and welldefined isolable catalysts we explored lewis acidic hydrocarbonsoluble and tefloncoated perfluoroarylboranes as methide abstractors starting with bcf figure  what followed was amazing new families of isolable highly active “singlesite” polymerization catalysts additional perfluoroarylboranealane cocatalysts and weakly coordinating anions numerous xray structures and precision analysis of molecular dynamics thermodynamics and polymerization mechanisms we showed how the electrostatic catalyst···cocatalystˉ ion pairing can direct olefin insertion stereochemistry and polymer architecture partnering with dow our chemistry to date has enabled production of about  billion kg of stronger more processable more recyclable polyolefins including those produced from sustainable sugarcane ethanol strong lightweight inexpensive chemically inert polyolefins find use in products as diverse as automotive parts food packaging agriculture clothing solar cell coatings and medical prosthetics in recent work we have been creating binuclear complexes with mechanistically dissimilar metal catalytic sites and demonstrating enzymelike cooperative interactions scaling with m···m’ distance and affording new polymers we are revisiting the original surfacebound catalysts and find that very strong brønsted acidic surfaces create species with virtually  of the sites catalytically active for olefin polymerization and even more intriguing arene hydrogenation the combination of exafs with jeff miller of argonne national lab twodimensional solid state nmr with marek pruski of ames national lab dft computation with alessandro motta of rome university and detailed mechanistic analysis has illuminated the catalyst structures and explained why h delivery is selective for a single arene πface for mixtures of aromatics these catalysts exhibit significant selectivity for carcinogenic benzene hydrogenation modeling possible processes for detoxifying gasoline enlarge figure    figure  soon after i arrived at northwestern i was intrigued by the work of stanford university’s jim collman on metal complexes that crystallize in stacks like coins to provide a pathway for onedimesional electrical conduction brian hoffman jim ibers mark ratner and i collaborated on synthetic spectroscopic structural and theoretical studies of these systems and showed that metal or ligand “partial oxidation” for example by i creates empty bandlike states and in cases such as metallophthalocyanines “metallike” d conductivity however for molecular systems the challenge remained of ensuring that facetoface stacking was preserved ideally with controllable ππ distances we addressed this issue with a “shish kebab” strategy in which phthalocyanine polymers were connected via central si–o–si ge–o–ge or sn–o–sn linkages figure  we could then “dial in” the levels of oxidation while preserving the stacking and analyze the results with a variety of incisive structural spectroscopic magnetic electrical and theoretical tools my fascination with charge transport phenomena in solids has continued and today involves both “soft” organic molecules and assemblies polymers and “hard” oxides chalcogenides materials the former studies focus on transistors solar cells and organic lightemitting diodes oleds using tunable earthabundant organic materials we seek to print these as “inks” in highthroughput production the key materials in a transistor the basic building block for all modern electronics are the semiconductor gate dielectric and the source drain and gate electrodes our first target was relatively unexplored electrontransporting ntype versus established holetransporting ptype organic semiconductors—necessary components of complementary circuits for highspeed lowpower operation collaborations with colleague tony facchetti and later with mike wasielewski yielded environmentally stable highmobility ntype semiconductors and ultimately devices with inkjetprinted complementary circuits theoretical studies with mark ratner convincingly defined the electronic structural and molecular architectural requirements for ntype semiconductors gate dielectrics positioned between the transistor gate electrode and the semiconductor modulate the flow of current through the semiconducting channel and are critical to real world performance collaborating with tony facchetti and mark ratner we invented selfassembled nanodielectrics sands that are compatible with organic electronics and deliver high dielectric constants chargetrapfree interfaces and nanoscale thicknesses sands significantly enhance the performance of diverse organic and inorganic transistors are radiationhard and are compatible with many substrate types they stimulated fruitful device collaborations with mark hersam and lincoln lauhon of northwestern john rogers now of northwestern david janes of purdue university and many companies this also led to the cofounding of two northwestern spinoffs with tony facchetti polyera and flexterra to transform these laboratory discoveries into printed products my interest in hard materials began with metal oxides the late s advent of cuprates with astounding superconducting properties caused me to ask whether such films could be grown using chemical processes therefore we designed synthesized and refined volatile metalorganic y ba cu tl bi and ca precursors that enabled the controlled growth of excellent quality superconducting cuprate films by a scalable metalorganic chemical vapor deposition mocvd process in collaboration with northwestern engineers bruce wessels carl kannewurf and bob chang these films and our ability to vary stoichiometry provided samples for studies aimed at understanding the intrinsic currentcarrying capacity of these materials enlarge figure  credit courtesy of tobin markscen   figure  credit courtesy of tobin markscen we next turned to other oxides especially those combining optical transparency and electrical conductivity which while seemingly contradictory is realized in materials such as tindoped indium oxide ito used in flatpanel displays solar cells touch screens and numerous other products as transparent electrodes we reasoned that alternative growth techniques doping and oxide matrices might enhance conductivity at comparable transparencies and allow growth on flexible plastics soon mocvd growth of cubic optically transparent ­cdxinxo films demonstrated record conductivity and benefited from theoretical collaboration with physicists arthur freeman of northwestern and julia medvedeva now of the university of missouri we also employed another lowtemperature technique to grow ino films on sand yielding transparent transistors with exceptional performance we next sought the solutionphase growth of electronically functional ideally flexible semiconducting dielectric and conducting oxide films from solution at temperatures compatible with polymeric substrates this was achieved via combustion synthesis affording amorphous oxide films and flexible transparent transistors of electronic quality comparable to those grown by industrial sputtering processes figure  similar strategies afforded transparent flexible electrodes for rollable plastic solar cells and unusual “antiambipolar” heterojunctions with carbon nanotubes and d metal chalcogenides in collaboration with mark hersam and lincoln lauhon such devices have potential in wifi and bluetooth circuitry similar concepts were employed in our very successful design of polymer solar cells this concludes a brief summary of my research at northwestern crossing many disciplinary boundaries these accomplishments would not have been possible without collaborators around the globe and the dedicated enthusiasm of my students and postdocs who contributed immensely to this enterprise i dedicate this address to them enlarge miriam e marks credit tobin marks   miriam e marks credit tobin marks as jackie barton noted in her  priestley address many of life’s pathways are the products of accidents and opportunities in that way i met and married my lifetime partner and fellow chemist indrani mukharji coming from an academic family of two scientists she understands the life we lead and amazingly puts up with me indrani’s father was gilbert stork’s first postdoc moving with him from harvard to columbia university in the s we still keep in touch with gilbert enlarge indrani mukharji and marks credit courtesy of tobin marks   indrani mukharji and marks credit courtesy of tobin marks after spending a decade as a corporate scientist indrani has been a senior administrator at northwestern for the past  years our daughter miriam marks wanted a different life after studying public policy and economics at stanford she is now a student at new york university law school i will be forever indebted to them for their love moral support and endless patience and what of chemistry why is it unique steve lippard argued in his  priestley address that the term “central science” might imply a mere service role and i suspect that all scientists feel that their discipline is central lord rutherford once said that “all science is either physics or stamp collecting” so we might instead regard chemistry as the “allpervasive science” or the “interfacing science” or the “indispensable science” however i feel that we should ask what we chemists do that is truly unique and that will be forever unique i would argue that first and foremost chemists make things that with deep knowledge and skill we create “the stuff that dreams are made of” as you ponder these issues you may feel the need for a libation so i will close with a toast to our acs award winners to chemists in every walk of life and to chemistry as an enduring indispensable and dynamic science good night and safe travels  more on this story • meet tobin j marks  priestley medalist • tobin j marks what is
