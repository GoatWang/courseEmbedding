him well as president and chief executive officer of glendalebased strattec security corp a designer and manufacturer of automotive accessories including locks key fobs door handles and powerassist devicesperhaps no business is more cyclical than the american automotive industryfor the moment krejci and strattec are riding the crest of that cycle having secured a record  million in new business

js business on facebook now the company must develop and deliver on the contracts it secured last year while at the same time devoting additional assets to researching and developing the next wave of automotive products“that’s new business that we won then we’ve got detailed engineering all the designs and lots of customer visits to make sure what we quoted gets implemented” krejci said“that’s just the nature of the business there aren’t many things that just fall out of the sky” krejci said “trying to develop product is a long process you do need patience and if you’re not investing in the future — in the new product or the enhanced product — in a few years you’re out of business”strattec is in a perpetual cycle incurring shortterm costs for research and development today that will reap revenue from sales of new products tomorrowkrejci cites seven key reasons for strattec’s consistent global growth in the cyclical and competitive automotive parts businesscommunication “i hold monthly meetings with salaried and hourly employees to let them know what has happened and what is coming up i encourage them to ask questions which they do i also have a lunch every month with a random selection of salaried and hourly employees we get to know each other and get into more indepth conversation about questions and issues that concern them” krejci saidpartnerships “for over  years we have had a unique partnership called vast vehicle access system technology with two privately held companies in complementary businesses by working together we have a global presence that we could not achieve individually” krejci saidstrategic management “for each business group we have set up a board of directors currently made up of primarily internal people however we are beginning to add people from outside the company” krejci saidfun “it is important that we take time to celebrate the victories on holidays i try to do a little something to put a smile on their faces for example on valentine’s day i will dress up as cupid and hand out roses to all of the female employees” krejci saidemployee wellness “we have won wellness awards it is important that we encourage people to take care of themselves for their own wellbeing for their families and to be a contributing member of strattec we offer health risk assessments with recommendations when needed walking incentives free fruit enhanced water free oranges and free apples” krejci saidglobal perspective “the world is getting smaller and more competitive by visiting our operations in other parts of the world we can better understand their strengths priorities and opportunities it is healthy for our associates to interact with people who come from different backgrounds” krejci saidinvesting in the future “whether it is new equipment or an engineering effort to introduce new products it is important that we continually invest in the future” krejci saidsteve jagler is the business editor of the milwaukee journal
