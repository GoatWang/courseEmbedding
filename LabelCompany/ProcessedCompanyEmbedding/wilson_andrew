recommend this product to a friend write review sort by most recent overall rating helpfulness see    displaying items  of  page  of  wyn  stars out of  december   wyn this book was not what i expected i expected to have the gospel told in short stories it is not that type of book rather it is a book of short chapters that take a passage and apply it to our lives making us look at our stories in different ways and especially in ways that god looks at them it was really neat once i got into it and i found the last twothirds much better than the first third every three or four chapters there was a break which encouraged the reader to stop and study something more carefully or to pause and pray or to review a passage written by a scholar and see how it pertained to the readers spiritual life it was refreshing to look at many spiritual thoughts in a different manner holding them up for new appraisals renewing my perspective on parts of the gospel that i had assumed meant one thing only to see another nugget deep inside this is an excellent book to use as a short thought provoking read when one wants to think on spiritual matters but not get involved in a long drawn out dissertation was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate cindy loven  stars out of  july   cindy loven andrew wilson has broken the gospel down into bite size you could say nuggets of truth written in small stories he calls god stories god stories is a book full of such nuggets written in a style similar to the bible you begin with old testament god stories and on into the new testament andrew however breaks his book up into acts one through five rather than into old and new testament sections he does a wonderful job of clarifying bible stories that might have been confusing to some in king james english a wonderful book full of gods truth definitely a great read sections end with a coffee break and who can pass up a coffee break the coffee breaks give us time for reflection over what we have read and also information to meditate and pray over some god stories titles the image of god the blueprint the city and the tower the battle for beauty the wedding and many many more this book is not a bible and cannot replace a bible but it is a book that can help people who struggle to understand the bible definitely a book to recommend to others was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate janna ryan north platte ne age  gender female  stars out of  july   janna ryan north platte ne age  gender female finally the kind of devotional book ive always wanted to see andrew wilson has a fresh perspective on many passages and verses of scripture he starts off with one of them and then he expounds upon it in such a way as to entertain the reader and get you to think all at the same time some of the chapters have endnotes that allow you to go a little deeper and then about every  chapters there are coffee breaks that are different short things like stop and study or pause and pray that break the flow nicely and give you a chance to ponder and reflect andrews outlook on life the bible and god are thoughtful insightful and a joy to delve into this book is perfect on my bedside table next to my alarm clock where i can pick it up and read a chapter or two anytime i need a break or where i can read the book start to finish ive waited a long time for someone to write a devotional that doesnt feel like a devotional was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate stacey  stars out of  july   stacey andrew wilsons god stories explorations of the gospel of god is a wonderfully thoughtprovoking nonfiction book the powerful content is broken into short chapter reads that really have a significant impact the table of contents is put together with terrific descriptions so it is easy to go back and find a specific story to reread the coffee breaks located throughout the book are cool moments to reflect pray study and worship god the only thing i would have liked to see would be some visuals maps drawings photos this is a terrific book was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no
