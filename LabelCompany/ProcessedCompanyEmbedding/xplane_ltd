rudder pedals and logitec g i am just starting this as there can be a whole list of ways to set up this and with different addons to know what is best well if you have any comments or questions to help those starting up then this is a good time to make and comments especially what one has found to get around or improve it for one could have done with another hat switch and couple extra switches so i could always keep my hands in one place but everyone to their ways one think i like how i have set it up so i can rotate the aircraft into different view with left right and rotate left and right so i can swing right around the aircraft and move its position to get back to d panel or forward with hud or without depending on your choice and the switch it provides enough i guess if you got what i have the button combination should be the same under joystickequipmentbuttons advanced joystick button  view forwardwithhud down switchright sidewheel  view chase up switchright side wheel  view
