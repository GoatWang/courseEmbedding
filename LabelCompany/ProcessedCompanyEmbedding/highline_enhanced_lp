authorities  mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition §  iv case cvvec document  filed  page  of  plaintiff highline capital management llc “highline” submits this trial memorandum in connection with the upcoming trial of this case against defendants high line venture partners lp high line venture partners ii lp high line venture partners gp llc and high line venture partners gp ii llc and shana fisher collectively “high line” preliminary statement this is a trademark infringement case the dispute is simple highline and high line are both investment fund managers both are based in new york city both manage “alternative investment” funds both invest millions of dollars in venture investments both regularly receive publicity about their investment activities and both refer to themselves and are referred to by third parties as “highline” and “high line” respectively although even that slight difference vanishes when as often occurs they are referred to orally rather than in writing high line’s use of “high line” in the alternative investments sector of the financial services industry is likely to confuse consumers by leading them to believe that high line or its investments are affiliated with or otherwise associated with highline the media has already confused the two including reporting that highline has made speculative highrisk investments that in fact were made by high line because highline has for two decades built a reputation for making cautious investment decisions based on thorough research that confusion is likely to damage highline’s reputation and goodwill moreover high line’s misappropriation of the “high line” name in connection with a venture capital fund effectively forecloses highline from making the natural extension of offering its own venture capital fund under the name “highline” highline will show at trial that it has had trademark rights in the highline name since  – fifteen years before high line’s adoption of its “high line venture partners” name in  highline registered its highline mark with the us patent and trademark office “uspto” in  – nine years before high line’s arrival on the scene which as a matter of case cvvec document  filed  page  of  law gave highline the exclusive right to use the highline mark in connection with investment fund management  usc §  at the time that high line selected the “high line” name it was not only thus on constructive notice of that trademark registration  usc §  but the evidence will show that it also had actual notice that “highline capital” was taken high line nevertheless proceeded with the “high line” name without ever checking the uspto trademark registration records or asking its counsel to clear the use of that name high line has sought to evade the certain liability that results from using a nearly identical mark for an essentially identical service by raising several technical defenses none of which are well taken it tried to petition to cancel highline’s registration on the basis that highline is not using that mark this court has already rejected that claim and dismissed high line’s counterclaims it asserts that it is not actually using “high line” as a trademark because it does not provide any services that argument is both factually wrong as high line does provide services under that mark and legally irrelevant since trade name use by a defendant can give rise to liability for infringement of the plaintiff’s trademark it argues that hedge fund and venture capital investment services are different but those types of investments are both are in the same category of “alternative investments” and both appeal to the same class of investors and compete for the same investor dollars moreover hedge fund managers not only include private equity and venture investments in their funds but also are increasingly offering standalone venture funds under their names next high line tries to avoid liability by citing the sophistication of some investors but the evidence will prove what common sense already suggests financial sophistication is not the same as typographic punctiliousness even sophisticated investors can be confused by the use of virtually identical names and finally it cites the fact that other entities are using a version of the highline mark but virtually all of those  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  uses are either in different fields or have already changed their names in response to challenges by highline highline has spent over twenty years carefully curating its reputation for investment management services which is the cornerstone of keeping and attracting new investors and is essential to its business with respect to its highline trademark it has done all the right things to put the public on notice of its trademark rights and to protect its rights against infringers high line in contrast did none of the right things – it adopted the high line mark recklessly without undertaking any trademark search without asking its lawyers to clear the trademark and despite having express knowledge that “highline capital” already used the highline name its adoption of that mark and its more recent effort to gain more publicity for its “high line” including through media reports and speaking roles at industry conferences is already causing confusion and that confusion will only get worse as the parties expand their services as a matter of law and equity high line should be permanently enjoined from further use of the high line name facts the following facts will be proved at trial i highline highline is a new yorkbased investment management firm founded in  by jacob doft through substantial effort highline has grown over the last twenty years from a small fund manager to a wellrecognized and respected investment firm with approximately  billion in assets under management over thirty staff and several investment funds commonly referred to as hedge funds

capital qualified fund ltd  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  highline’s strategy focuses primarily on long and short investments in publiclytraded equities but also includes private equity investments some of which have been in startups both its investment strategy and brand are built upon thorough research through which it seeks to gain deeper market insights than other investors allowing its funds to outperform the market while also hedging its investments to reduce risk and volatility highline’s strategy has achieved marked success during the past two decades highline’s flagship fund has outperformed the market while maintaining lower risk and volatility as compared to the sp  as is standard in the alternative investment sector of the financial industry highline built its brand over the years through personal interactions and word of mouth including through meetings with potential investors and investment consultants by attending and speaking at industry events and by seeking positive publicity in the trade and business press among highline’s recent successes in the media were that in february  bloomberg markets magazine ranked highline among the top  performing large hedge fund managers in the nation also in  mr doft appeared on bloomberg’s television network which is an effective way to promote the highline brand because that network is viewed by potential investors highline has taken numerous steps to protect the goodwill associated with its name and reputation in  highline received a federal trademark registration for its highline word mark for “financial services in the nature of investment fund management” that registration includes the information that highline has used the highline mark since  in  as of september   highline had about  million in private equity investments in  its portfolio  indeed until very recently alternative investment managers were prohibited from using traditional forms of advertising and even now alternative investment managers seek to build their reputation through word of mouth rather than mass media advertising  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  highline received a second federal trademark registration this time for its logo which prominently features the highline mark also for “financial services in the nature of investment fund management” collectively the “highline marks” both registrations are valid subsisting and incontestable and serve as conclusive evidence of highline’s ownership of the marks as a matter of law these trademark registrations give highline the “exclusive right to use” the registered highline marks throughout the united states in connection with financial services  usc §  “the registration shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark of the registrant’s ownership of the mark and of the registrant’s exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce” emphasis added these registrations also operate as a matter of law to put third parties – including defendants – on constructive notice of highline’s trademark registrations  usc §  as part of its efforts to protect its brand highline has monitored the market to prevent infringing uses of the highline mark whenever it learns of a potential infringer whose use of a confusing name threatens to harm highline’s reputation highline has taken steps to protect its marks in most cases highline has been able to resolve these disputes amicably with the infringer agreeing to change its name when necessary though highline has filed suit ii high line high line was established in  as a subsidiary of iac when high line selected its name it knew that the name “highline capital” had already been taken but neither it nor iac ever conducted any trademark search or asked counsel whether it could use the name “high line” despite the known existence of another entity called “highline capital” there also is no record of high line inquiring as to the nature of highline capital or its location or the services it provided had high line and iac done a trademark search at that time they would have  case cvvec

line describes as high risk investments that have the potential to earn high returns though they also have the potential to result in a total loss of the investment high line finds its investments through word of mouth and personal interactions such as by attending conferences and industry events or receiving emails and calls from companies who have learned about high line and are seeking investors over the years high line has grown in both size and prominence it now runs four venture capital investment funds that invest in early stage startups high line’s investments are typically reported in the media which has helped raise high line’s visibility in the marketplace high line currently invests the money of only two investors – ms fisher and iac – but has reserved the right to actively seek new investors in the future high line’s fund documents all include provisions that expressly permit high line to accept money from third party investors and high line has not ruled out the possibility of opening its funds to new investors indeed ms fisher regularly receives calls from potential investors including institutional investors seeking to invest in her funds although she has not yet opened her funds to outside investors she has told these third parties that she will let them know when she is ready to do so and she has insisted throughout this litigation that she wants to ensure that she has the right to do so in the future high line has also discussed the possibility of creating “special purpose vehicles” for the purpose of accepting new investors when high line exercises its right to invest additional funds in some of its investments in order to maintain its pro rata ownership stake  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  iii the dispute highline first became aware of high line in mid when it received notice that shana fisher of high line was speaking at a prominent hedge fund conference highline has since learned of news reports touting startup investments made by high line sometimes misidentified as “highline” or “highline capital” – generally highly speculative investments that are inconsistent with the cautious investments pursued by highline for example one article mistakenly identified “highline capital” as a company that would invest half a million dollars based solely on a backofnapkin idea see pl ex  alyson shontell these investors will give you  for a startup idea sketched on a napkin – no product needed business insider indonesia apr   as highline has done in other cases upon learning of high line highline reached out to high line to express its objections when it became clear that high line was not interested in reaching an amicable resolution highline filed the instant action to enforce its trademark rights and protect its reputation both highline and high line have garnered recognition in the industry and the attention of the media not all of that recognition has been good – high line for example was an investor in aereo which declared bankruptcy after the supreme court found it liable for copyright infringement for highline maintaining its reputation as a cautious researchbased successful investor

as the parties pursue their natural expansion strategies for highline that expansion may very well lead it to launch a standalone venture capital fund highline already includes private equity and venture capital investments as part of its funds and consistent with the trends at other hedge fund managers highline may in the future want to launch a standalone venture capital fund under its highline name since it already has built an operation and a brand reputation that would allow it to do so for high line its natural expansion would be to open its investment funds to third party investors a right that it already has built into its fund documents and a request that high line has repeatedly received from outside parties these expansion plans will put the parties on a direct

“high line” without additional words indeed one of highline’s registered trademarks is for “highline” alone second even when the marks are used with the additional words there is no meaningful distinction under the lanham act because the additional words are not distinctive although courts must consider trademarks as a whole in analyzing similarity when a mark contains a dominant part or

names both offer services that can compete for the same pool of investment dollars from the same types of investors and both exist to make equity investments in companies which if profitable create positive returns for their investors they both make equity investments – in high line’s case exclusively in private equity and venture capital in highline’s case as part of its larger fund as of september   highline had over  million of its assets under management invested in private equities the majority of which are venture investments although high line currently has only two investors in

currently operate a separate venture capital fund many investment managers that manage hedge funds including tiger global management coatue management and maverick capital have recently initiated such funds under their same brands and highline may well do the same in the years to come there is little doubt that investors could believe that highline has started a venture fund or simply that high line’s investments – which are similar to investments highline and other hedge funds make – were made by highline the proximity between hedge funds and venture capital funds is also evidenced by the fact that conferences are attended by representatives from both types of funds indeed highline first became aware of high line because of shana fisher’s speaking role at a prominent hedge fund conference high line is expected to argue that it is not proximate to highline because it is not providing services to “outside” investors and is therefore akin to an individual investing her own money to the contrary high line offers services in a number ways including to its investors and to the companies in which it invests first high line is structured—like highline—such that the fund manager takes  of the respective fund’s profits as although certain large investors may have a dedicated staff focused on venture capital and a  different team focused on hedge funds this is not universally true and is irrelevant to the question at hand which is whether investors could believe that highline and high line “have the same source” see k advisors llc  wl  at   case cvvec document

there is little gap to bridge see gucci am inc v guess inc  fsuppd   sdny  “where the companies target the same customers there is no gap to bridge and this factor leans in favor of the plaintiff” highline and high line already operate in the alternative asset space they both make venture capital investments and venture capital funds and hedge funds compete for the same class of investors further while highline has no immediate plans to open a separate venture capital fund it may very well do so in the future as some other hedge fund managers have already done high line’s misappropriation of the “high line” name in connection with a venture capital fund effectively forecloses highline from making the natural extension of offering its own venture capital fund under the name “highline” moreover the existence of a “high line” venture capital fund would surely cause confusion with highline’s venture fund no matter what highline named its fund in addition even if highline never opens a separate venture capital fund the fact that other hedge fund managers recently have done so increases the likelihood that consumers encountering high line’s name will assume that highline has joined this growing trend see dreyfus fund inc  f supp at –  actual confusion already exists “while    it is not necessary to show actual confusion    there can be no more positive or substantial proof of the likelihood of confusion than proof of actual confusion” mobil oil corp  fd at  citation omitted actual confusion is not limited to instances  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  of completed mistaken transactions but includes any instances of confusion from prospective investors and others in the financial services community morningside grp  fd at  “evidence of actual confusion need not be limited to evidence of mistaken completed transactions” two recent articles in financial publications mistakenly referred to high line as “highline capital” and erroneously attributed high line’s investments and investing approach to highline first in september  crain’s misattributed high line’s investment in a startup called howgood to “highline capital” pl ex  this confusion was compounded by the online publication technically brooklyn which republished the article pl ex  then in april  business insider indonesia mistakenly identified “highline capital” rather than high line as a company that would invest  based solely on a backofnapkin idea pl ex  the business insider indonesia article was republished in multiple publications pl exs   attributing such an impulsive approach to investment decisions to highline detracts from the brand that highline has built during twenty years of thorough research prudence and integrity the fact that these articles were written by journalists covering the financial sector is itself compelling evidence of the inherent confusion between highline and high line see tri star pictures inc v unger  f supp d   sdny  “evidence of actual confusion is significant” where sophisticated journalists and film reviewers wrote articles associating defendant’s product with plaintiff’s cuisinarts inc v robot–coupe int’l corp  f supp   sdny  “that a trio of independent journalists two of them food writing specialists reached the same erroneous conclusion concerning the nature of the  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  food processors now being sold and cuisinarts’ status in the industry is eloquent testimony to the misleading propensity of certain aspects of rc–i’s campaign” in another instance shana fisher spoke at a conference and a member of the audience who was the founder of a startup and wrote a guide on getting investments sent a tweet that misattributed her affiliation as highline capital pl ex  although mr shen now characterizes his tweet as a mistake he has no explanation for why he associated ms fisher with “highline capital” and in any event followers of his tweet had no way of knowing that when he wrote “highline capital” he really meant “high line venture partners” other erroneous references to highline show the clear potential for confusion in particular at least twentyfive articles have misspelled “high line” as one word “highline” pl exs  this increases the possibility that potential investors and others in the financial services field will perceive high line’s services to be connected with highline the fact that these examples of confusion and potential confusion are not from investors does not affect the analysis as discussed above confusion is relevant regardless of whether it arises from prospective consumers or others in the financial community as the second circuit stated recognizing the relevance of actual confusion beyond mistaken completed transactions is important here because in the financial world an investor will almost never complete a transaction with a mistakenly identified party if nothing else compliance with the due diligence requirement will normally prevent such errors but investors might be confused about the affiliation between two  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  similarly named companies and might very well alter their behavior based on that confusion morningside grp  fd at  see also hon  fd at  “we have recognized nonpurchaser confusion as relevant”  high line’s lack of good faith high line

prior to adopting of a mark flat rate movers ltd v flatrate moving  storage inc no  cv  mgc  wl  at  sdny apr   high line did none of those things high line may argue that it had no malicious intent against highline but the law is clear that “benign intent alone cannot vitiate the likelihood of confusion” lexington mgmt corp  f supp d at  at the time it adopted the “high line” name high line was aware that “highline capital” was already in use not only did high line decide to adopt the “high line” name anyway but it did so without even conducting a trademark search to doublecheck the availability of the “high line” name that decision was particularly reckless given that high line’s lawyers at iac – who are sophisticated about the selection and protection of trademarks – were involved in identifying whether the name was available and in registering the business name with the secretary of state “‘bad faith may be inferred from the junior user’s actual or constructive knowledge of the senior user’s mark’ although such knowledge does not ‘without more create an inference of bad faith” flat rate movers ltd  wl  at  citations omitted at the minimum high line’s and

plaintiff’s thereby tarnishing plaintiff’s reputation if consumers confuse the two” morningside grp  fd at  highline has spent over twenty years building its brand and making sure that it offers quality services to its investors it has spent considerable effort in fostering a careful balance of risk and return in its portfolios and in building its reputation in the marketplace even if high line offers a comparable level of quality in its services highline has no control over the quality of high line’s services now or in the future highline “is not required to put its reputation in defendant’s hands no matter how capable those hands may be” mobil oil corp  fd at  citation omitted that is especially the case in a situation like the one here publicity about high line is so inconsistent with highline’s reputation  even sophisticated consumers will be confused the final polaroid factor – the sophistication of the parties’ potential customers – also weighs in highline’s favor first although there is no dispute that many of the potential investors in hedge funds and venture capital funds are sophisticated “the fact that the consumers are sophisticated including in the financial services field is not a shield from liability” k advisors llc  wl  at  even sophisticated investors may attribute information about high line to highline gain initial interest in high line on the basis of its name or lose initial interest in highline because of what they have heard about high line moreover as noted above financial sophistication does not necessarily connote typographic punctiliousness  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  furthermore not all potential investors have a high level of sophistication for example the sec rules for determining accredited or qualified investors is based on net worth not on the experience or savvy of the investor so a sizeable number of people who invest in alternate asset investments do not have the same level of sophistication as for example a typical institutional investor further third parties and nonpurchasers such as journalists and others in the financial community may be less sophisticated may not have the benefit of due diligence and may be more susceptible to confusion morningside grp  fd at  high line can be expected to argue that most investors in venture capital and hedge funds engage in a significant level of due diligence before they invest which means that there is little chance that an investor will mistakenly invest in the wrong fund this argument misses the mark the law on confusion does not require highline to prove that a potential investor would actually invest in the wrong fund see id at  “evidence of actual confusion need not be limited to evidence of mistaken completed transactions    courts can properly take into account evidence of ‘either a diversion of sales damage to goodwill or loss of control over reputation’” citation omitted emphasis in original there are over  hedge funds and venture capital funds in existence even the most diligent investor cannot do due diligence on all of them it follows that investors must make choices to winnow the field and those initial determinations are often influenced by characterizations about a fund or investment manager conveyed by word of mouth news articles or reports of presentations at conferences highline’s concern is that potential investors may eliminate highline from consideration even before they get to the due diligence stage based on something they may have heard about high line and misattributed to highline k advisors llc  wl  at  “the sophistication of the investors does not mitigate” the risk of investors “eschewing opportunities  case cvvec document  filed  page  of  to meet with plaintiff and to learn about its products because of the wordofmouth association” with defendants as well as a risk that plaintiff would “lose control of its reputation”  balancing of the polaroid factors weighs heavily against high line these factors taken together weigh heavily in favor of a finding of a likelihood of confusion highline and high line are virtually identical and are both being used in similar and overlapping segments of the financial services market it is likely that members of the investment community and prospective investors would confuse highline for high line or vice versa—and indeed there are already articles and a social media post evidencing actual and potential confusion this potential for confusion is exacerbated by the fact that hedge fund managers and hedge funds are bridging the gap to enter venture capital territory the past few years and it would not be unreasonable for highline to join that trend or at least for consumers to believe it has done so although it is true that many investors in hedge funds and venture capital funds are sophisticated as investors not all are alert to the difference between highline and high line and sophistication would not insulate consumers from all confusion the balance of these factors favors highline c high line is liable for trademark infringement and unfair competition under new york common law the analysis of trademark infringement and unfair competition under new york common law is effectively the same as that for infringement under the lanham act except that bad faith is required to prove unfair competition but not trademark infringement under the common law because highline has proved trademark infringement under the lanham act and that high line adopted its name in bad faith it has also

over two decades as discussed above even the misattribution of positive information about high line could cause highline irreparable harm if it is inconsistent with highline’s brand and reputation for

see us polo ass’n  f supp d at  the balancing of equities also strongly favors an injunction in contrast to the extensive harm that would result to highline if high line were allowed to continue infringing there would be little to no burden on high line from being ordered to change its name as it has been in business for only five years and it has not yet begun to solicit outside investors
