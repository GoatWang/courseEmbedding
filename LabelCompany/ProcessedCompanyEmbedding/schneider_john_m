jan   cheyenne wyo  the wyoming board of medicine has temporarily suspended the license of a cody doctor alleging he falsely certified that a patient needed emergency surgery just days before the man died from an overdose of pain medication the board took the action saturday against dr john h schneider jr a neurosurgeon with practices in cody and billings mont attempts to reach schneider for comment were unsuccessful tuesday a cody lawyer who represents him in other matters declined comment schneider performed back surgery nov  on a montana man identified by the board only as john doe who checked in that day at west park hospital in cody the boards order states a board investigation determined that schneider looked at an mri on nov  that the patients montana doctors had prepared on nov  and stated he determined that emergency surgery was required the order states that schneider didnt order a new mri schneider stated in his dictated notes that he attempted to reach the mans montana doctors before the surgery but his calls werent returned the boards order states that the mans medical facility in montana was unable to confirm that schneider tried to contact doctors there the order states that the patient was discharged from the cody hospital on dec  with prescriptions from schneider for pain medication the man and his wife returned to their montana home where she found him dead the next morning a pathologist determined the man died from an overdose of four pain medications the boards order states that all had been prescribed by schneider it is believed that dr schneider violated the wyoming medical practice act by making a false fraudulent or deceptive statement in the medical records regarding the emergent nature of mr does condition and the need for immediate surgery the order states the order also alleges schneider violated the wyoming medical practice act through his prescription of painkillers and by discharging the man from the hospital without adequate provisions to make sure he was receiving adequate oxygen given his medical condition the board alleges that schneiders office had asked the mans health insurance provider in midnovember whether his policy would cover surgery the company responded that it could not cover surgery by schneider because coverage was limited to specific providers the boards order states the insurance provider would cover emergency surgery wherever it was necessary kevin d bohnenblust executive director of the wyoming board of medicine said tuesday the board could hold a hearing on the matter as soon as midapril nothing has been finally adjudicated but theres evidence that suggests thats what happened so were moving forward with it bohnenblust said schneider was named last month as a defendant in a federal lawsuit filed by jimmie g biles another cody doctor biles claims that schneider and his wife got an indiana woman to send a mass mailing to more than  residents of north central wyoming in  disparaging biles medical practice the lawsuit claims that schneider hoped the mailing would persuade people to seek medical attention from another doctor who would refer neurosurgical patients to schneider who has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit biles also is pressing a lawsuit against the indiana woman alleging she took money from schneider to distribute the fliers us district judge alan b johnson on jan  denied a request from schneider and his wife to dismiss subpoenas seeking records of any payments or communications between them and the indiana woman lawyer laurence stinson of cody represents schneider in the federal litigation and declined comment on tuesday he said he did not represent schneider before the medical board angry  sad  funny  wow  love
