by prof engert the lead investigator for the study at the lugano international meeting on malignant lymphoma in  in sum afm has been found to be safe at the doses tested certain biomarkers indicated

to the market the majority of patients – while initially responding to therapy  relapse within a few months and need to resort to experimental therapies this patient population comprises between  and  new cases every year in north america the european union and japan  affimed’s clinical data suggest that afm due to its novel mode of action may be active in these patients this indication could provide a fast path to market                   we plan to explore whether afm may not only be beneficial in the salvage setting but also as part of a regimen that is applied earlier after diagnosis where next to efficacy safety is an important consideration for the choice of therapy if clinical trials are successful afm may ultimately achieve a place among earlierline therapies perhaps in combination with immunomodulators tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with other biologics we plan to pursue afm in other cdpositive indications such as tcell lymphoma dlbcl and in other leukemias and

need remains in refractory diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl until now most new therapeutic options have shown modest response rates in these patients however by far the strongest effects were seen with treatments using tcells to fight the cancer the response rates observed with this product are about twice as high   as those obtained with other experimental treatments used currently in the salvage setting and the complete responses are all molecular responses ie cdpositive cells are completely ablated such that none are detectable with the most sensitive techniques available studies suggest that the absence of minimal residual disease is a predictor of longterm outcome and hence this observation may translate into extended progressionfree survival in preclinical studies afm has shown very potent cytotoxicity even at very low tcell counts this differentiation to blinatumomab may be of clinical relevance for patients whose immune system is compromised eg from myelosuppressive

approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a
