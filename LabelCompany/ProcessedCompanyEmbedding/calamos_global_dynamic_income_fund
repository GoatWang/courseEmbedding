normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for

signals can impact returns currency hedged equity how currency hedging signals can impact returns  jeremy schwartz  director of research tweet share feedback wisdomtree has suggested that the baseline allocation for international equities should be considered from a standpoint of being fully currency hedged—that is a strategic starting point that focuses on assuming just equity market risk without a secondary currency bet or component added to returns there will be times when being fully currency hedged will enhance returns over unhedged alternatives ie when the dollar is strengthening versus foreign currencies and times when fully currencyhedged strategies will not participate in the currency gains of unhedged strategies ie when the dollar is weakening if an investor wishes to be more tactical and seeks to adjust the level of currency hedging over time how can this be done without simply taking a discretionary and subjective view on the future performance of each currency against the dollar to help answer the question of how much to hedge and for what currencies wisdomtree developed a line of currencyhedged indexes that dynamically determine when it is more attractive and less attractive to adopt a hedged position this is done with a rulesbased quantitative approach that looks at three signals to determine currency hedge ratio interest rate differentials momentum and value each signal contributes onethird to the overall hedge ratio—the interest rate and momentum signals each will provide a signal either to hedge or not hedge so will add  or  to the overall hedge ratio the value signal will provide a signal either to hedge half hedge or not hedge so will add   or  to the overall hedge ratio thus the overall hedge ratio for a currency can be       or  research supported by our partner—record currency management limited “record”— on the dynamic signals for these indexes shows that for broad international benchmarks each of these factors has added value or provided higher returns compared to being fully unhedged or fully hedged what is interesting though is that for any given currency the strength of each signal can vary below we’ll discuss the merits of each signal and implications for how these dynamically hedged indexes are positioned today in short our research suggests that the current environment supports tactically hedging a majority of currency exposures   diversifying signals and time horizon in creating an overall tactical hedging strategy for the broad international markets the goal was to diversify the time horizon of these signals and have a consistent process across all developed world currencies so as not to cherrypick what signals worked for a given currency the analysis below was conducted from december   to december   “the period” to illustrate the effectiveness of dynamic hedging that has been seen • the interest rate signal tended to be the strongest signal for the broad international benchmarks and worked over the medium term • the momentum signal tended to be one of the strongest signals for many individual currencies and second strongest for broad international benchmarks and worked best over the short term • the value signal tended to be the weakest signal from a pure valueadded standpoint but it has helped diversify signals and worked over the medium to long term for a broad developed international benchmark the current hedge ratios suggest being approximately  hedged in the aggregate reflecting the weighted average of the respective hedge ratios for each currency in the benchmark for the euro the signals suggest being  hedged and for the yen being  hedged   effectiveness and current hedge ratios of the signals it is useful to look at the efficacy of each signal in the context of what the hedge ratios are suggesting should be hedged today   interest rate signal clear direction and biggest impact the most powerful signal over the period analyzed nearly  years has been the interest rate signal which provided returns that were nearly  per year better compared to a fully hedged strategy for a broad developed international benchmark for the euro alone the interest rate signal provided returns that were  per year better than a fully hedged strategy in the current environment in which the us federal reserve just raised interest rates and the european central bank ecb took its rates further into negative territory this signal argues for being hedged and will likely continue to suggest this for some time the same can be said for the yen taken by itself the most impactful longrun signal overall would suggest staying hedged in the euro and yen and for many of the other developed international currencies   signals suggesting  hedging the yen yen weakness losing momentum the momentum signal was the second most powerful signal for the broad international markets adding  per year over a fully hedged strategy over the period and was the most effective signal for hedging the yen on its own the yen’s momentum signal did turn at the end of december  and went from suggesting being hedged on the momentum signal to suggesting being unhedged what caused this in  there was a lack of a persistent weakness in the yen the wisdomtree dynamic currency hedged japan equity index thus adjusted the hedge ratio from  as of the end of november to  as of the end of december qualitatively speaking we think the market is waiting to see more action from the bank of japan before the yen weakens meaningfully in which case the momentum signal would follow another initial downward move likely increasing the hedge ratio for now we think the case to add meaningful unhedged yen exposure must be balanced by the still strong negative correlations between currency and equity markets that is to say if an investor were extra bullish on the yen this would likely be a negative factor for this exportoriented equity market the momentum signal for the euro continues to signal being hedged   value signals on euro and yen close to  undervalued band wisdomtree’s dynamic hedge on the value signal is fully hedged if a currency is  or more overvalued compared to purchasing power parity ppp until it reaches ppp unhedged if  or more undervalued until it reaches ppp and half hedged otherwise the euro and yen are within  to  of crossing the  undervalued threshold which would lower the hedge ratio for each of these currencies by  some believe the fact that the euro and yen are already undervalued versus ppp metrics is less of a reason to hedge these currencies it’s important to note that undervalued currencies can and have in the past weakened further which is why this signal uses a  threshold others may note that for the yen the value signal actually detracted value from a fully hedged strategy why then still keep the value signal in the dynamic offering as we said before the three signals were chosen to diversify efficacy over multiple time horizons and to have a consistent process across all developed world currencies the value signal can work over longer periods and it has worked for most of the developed world currencies outside the yen for those lowering their hedge ratio on the yen—and the euro as well—just because they think it is already undervalued we’d note that this undervaluation could increase further and that the interest rates and momentum signals are at least as important but also have been more impactful in the long run         no wisdomtree fund is sponsored endorsed sold or promoted by record currency

fund information the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and marketcap sizes each of which has a unique risk profile as a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities these include fluctuations in currency exchange rates increased price volatility and difficulty obtaining information there are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase investments by the fund in lowerrated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higherrated securities including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates go up the value of debt securities in the fund’s portfolio generally will decline the fund may invest in derivative securities including options the use of derivatives present risks different from and possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities there is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the fund will succeed one of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised the fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure however the effectiveness of the fund’s index optionbased risk management strategy may be reduced if the fund’s equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions the fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options unusual market conditions or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s options strategies and for these and other reasons the fund’s options strategies may not reduce the fund’s volatility to the extent desired from time to time the fund may reduce its holdings of put options resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline the goal of the levelrate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable though not assured level of cash flow monthly distributions paid may include net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains and if necessary return of capital maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the fund leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage financing the ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets each fund has specific risks which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses the general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk dividend and income risk

distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind  meaning that the fund distributes current portfolio holdings of securities rather than cash by avoiding the sale of securities to meet redemptions nextshares can potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions and associated shareholder taxes the enhanced tax

utah vermont virginia washington west virginia wisconsin wyoming other by submitting below you certify that you have read and agree to our privacy policy next step home blog how currency hedging signals can impact returns currency hedged equity how currency hedging signals can impact returns  jeremy schwartz  director of research tweet share feedback wisdomtree has suggested that the baseline allocation for international equities should be considered from a standpoint of being fully currency hedged—that is a strategic starting point that focuses on assuming just equity market risk without a secondary currency bet or component added to returns there will be times when being fully currency hedged will enhance returns over unhedged alternatives ie when the dollar is strengthening versus foreign currencies and times when fully currencyhedged strategies will not participate in the currency gains of unhedged strategies ie when the dollar is weakening if an investor wishes to be more tactical and seeks to adjust the level of currency hedging over time how can this be done without simply taking a discretionary and subjective view on the future performance of each currency against the dollar to help answer the question of how much to hedge and for what currencies wisdomtree developed a line of currencyhedged indexes that dynamically determine when it is more attractive and less attractive to adopt a hedged position this is done with a rulesbased quantitative approach that looks at three signals to determine currency hedge ratio interest rate differentials momentum and value each signal contributes onethird to the overall hedge ratio—the interest rate and momentum signals each will provide a signal either to hedge or not hedge so will add  or  to the overall hedge ratio the value signal will provide a signal either to hedge half hedge or not hedge so will add   or  to the overall hedge ratio thus the overall hedge ratio for a currency can be       or  research supported by our partner—record currency management limited “record”— on the dynamic signals for these indexes shows that for broad international benchmarks each of these factors has added value or provided higher returns compared to being fully unhedged or fully hedged what is interesting though is that for any given currency the strength of each signal can vary below we’ll discuss the merits of each signal and implications for how these dynamically hedged indexes are positioned today in short our research suggests that the current environment supports tactically hedging a majority of currency exposures   diversifying signals and time horizon in creating an overall tactical hedging strategy for the broad international markets the goal was to diversify the time horizon of these signals and have a consistent process across all developed world currencies so as not to cherrypick what signals worked for a given currency the analysis below was conducted from december   to december   “the period” to illustrate the effectiveness of dynamic hedging that has been seen • the interest rate signal tended to be the strongest signal for the broad international benchmarks and worked over the medium term • the momentum signal tended to be one of the strongest signals for many individual currencies and second strongest for broad international benchmarks and worked best over the short term • the value signal tended to be the weakest signal from a pure valueadded standpoint but it has helped diversify signals and worked over the medium to long term for a broad developed international benchmark the current hedge ratios suggest being approximately  hedged in the aggregate reflecting the weighted average of the respective hedge ratios for each currency in the benchmark for the euro the signals suggest being  hedged and for the yen being  hedged   effectiveness and current hedge ratios of the signals it is useful to look at the efficacy of each signal in the context of what the hedge ratios are suggesting should be hedged today   interest rate signal clear direction and biggest impact the most powerful signal over the period analyzed nearly  years has been the interest rate signal which provided returns that were nearly  per year better compared to a fully hedged strategy for a broad developed international benchmark for the euro alone the interest rate signal provided returns that were  per year better than a fully hedged strategy in the current environment in which the us federal reserve just raised interest rates and the european central bank ecb took its rates further into negative territory this signal argues for being hedged and will likely continue to suggest this for some time the same can be said for the yen taken by itself the most impactful longrun signal overall would suggest staying hedged in the euro and yen and for many of the other developed international currencies   signals suggesting  hedging the yen yen weakness losing momentum the momentum signal was the second most powerful signal for the broad international markets adding  per year over a fully hedged strategy over the period and was the most effective signal for hedging the yen on its own the yen’s momentum signal did turn at the end of december  and went from suggesting being hedged on the momentum signal to suggesting being unhedged what caused this in  there was a lack of a persistent weakness in the yen the wisdomtree dynamic currency hedged japan equity index thus adjusted the hedge ratio from  as of the end of november to  as of the end of december qualitatively speaking we think the market is waiting to see more action from the bank of japan before the yen weakens meaningfully in which case the momentum signal would follow another initial downward move likely increasing the hedge ratio for now we think the case to add meaningful unhedged yen exposure must be balanced by the still strong negative correlations between currency and equity markets that is to say if an investor were extra bullish on the yen this would likely be a negative factor for this exportoriented equity market the momentum signal for the euro continues to signal being hedged   value signals on euro and yen close to  undervalued band wisdomtree’s dynamic hedge on the value signal is fully hedged if a currency is  or more overvalued compared to purchasing power parity ppp until it reaches ppp unhedged if  or more undervalued until it reaches ppp and half hedged otherwise the euro and yen are within  to  of crossing the  undervalued threshold which would lower the hedge ratio for each of these currencies by  some believe the fact that the euro and yen are already undervalued versus ppp metrics is less of a reason to hedge these currencies it’s important to note that undervalued currencies can and have in the past weakened further which is why this signal uses a  threshold others may note that for the yen the value signal actually detracted value from a fully hedged strategy why then still keep the value signal in the dynamic offering as we said before the three signals were chosen to diversify efficacy over multiple time horizons and to have a consistent process across all developed world currencies the value signal can work over longer periods and it has worked for most of the developed world currencies outside the yen for those lowering their hedge ratio on the yen—and the euro as well—just because they think it is already undervalued we’d note that this undervaluation could increase further and that the interest rates and momentum signals are at least as important but also have been more impactful in the long run         no wisdomtree fund is sponsored endorsed sold or promoted by record currency
