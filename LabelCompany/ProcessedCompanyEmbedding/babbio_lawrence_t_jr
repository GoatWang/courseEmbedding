project manager – involved in the project from concept design through construction owner stevens institute of technology architect cubellis ecoplan contractor terminal construction about the project the lawrence t babbio jr center for technology management is one of the world’s preeminent institutions in the education of professionals who lead and manage technological innovation in businesses in america and around the world  educating managers who use technology to create extraordinary value for the societies in which they live it offers education programs designed and delivered by leading industry practitioners who are important contributors to the creation of new knowledge in the field   the howe school also conducts worldclass research in several focused areas of technology management especially in the domain of technology innovation commercialization and entrepreneurship  research is applied in orientation and grounded in technogenesis®   technogenesis is stevens’ educational environment where students faculty and industry collaborate to turn innovation invention and discovery into marketplace successopened in the spring of  the lawrence t babbio jr center for technology management a sixstory  square foot structure serves as the new signature headquarters for the wesley j howe school of technology management at stevens institute of technology  on the lower four levels a vibrant mix of classrooms laboratories and research library are united by an atrium lobby  externally the lecture hall volume is used expressively to evoke the energy of the activity within  above students faculty and visiting business representatives work together in an office environment that is the antithesis of the “traditional” faculty office suite  a glassenclosed conference and open teaming area seems to hover within the top of the atrium lobby enclosure and offers a suitable environment to foster the kind of corporate partnerships that form the basis of the program the center is blessed with amazing contextual opportunities on one side is a rich and vibrant urban landscape of  story buildings of a variety of materials and historical styles on another it faces campus buildings gates and pathways leading to more campuslike areas of the institute finally sitting atop the cliffs to the hudson the site offers panoramic views of the river and the manhattan skyline the entrepreneurial drive and spirit of the howe school of technology management was a catalyst for developing a vocabulary that highlights the contrast between a contextuallyresponsive primary form and vigorously sculptural and modern forms the primary form of the building takes cues from its neighbors for materials setbacks and various alignments of both mass and detail  a round tapering metalclad form housing lecture rooms intersects the primary volume aggressively and helping to form a high arcade that very loosely recalls the crenellations of the adjacent gothic gateway to the original campus area finally a very simple glassclad atrium form engages the primary form at it’s center to unite a variety of interior areas and to afford to many within the building the incredible view of the hudson river and manhattan skyline  the atrium’s angled alignment acknowledges the configuration of adjacent pedestrian walkways using this prominent site to unite the urban and more traditional landscapes of the steven’s campusa fourstory parking garage built into the side of the promontory edge of the campus forms the base of the building  when completed the garage will extend toward the river its roof top forming an expansive plaza entrance for the babbio center and an important new campus landscape asset for more information about the management program click here

mcguire of counsel for appellant aronson mayefsky  sloan llp new york allan e mayefsky and lawrence b trachtenberg of counsel for respondent order supreme court new york county laura drager j entered august   which to the extent appealed from granted so much of plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as sought a declaration that he is entitled to separate property credits for his contributions to the acquisition of the park avenue apartment the connecticut residence and the connecticut parcels and declared the specific amounts of the credits to which plaintiff is entitled and denied without prejudice so much of the motion as sought a declaration with respect to the joint goldman sachs and jp morgan accounts and the interest in greycroft partners lp declaring that plaintiff is entitled to separate property credits with respect to those items but that the amounts of the credits cannot be determined at present unanimously modified on the law to deny the motion with respect to the connecticut parcels and the funds paid at closing for the purchase of the park avenue apartment from the parties joint account and to declare that plaintiff is not entitled to separate property credits with respect to those items and is not entitled to separate property credits with respect to the joint goldman sachs and jp morgan accounts and the interest in greycroft partners and otherwise affirmed without coststhe parties prenuptial agreement provides in pertinent part that “in the event of an operative event marital property as defined elsewhere in the agreement shall be distributed equally between the parties in accordance with the following provisions except that if the parties have been married for ten  years or less and either party is able to identify one million  dollars or more of separate property that was used for the acquisition of the marital property that party shall first receive the amount of his or her contribution of separate property prior to the division of the remaining value of such property if any” ¶ e  “operative event” is defined as inter alia “the delivery by either party to the other of written notification ․ of an intention to terminate the marriage” ¶ a construing the parties prenuptial agreement in accord with the plain meaning of its terms and interpreting every part of the agreement “with reference to the whole” see beal sav bank v sommer  nyd     we find that eligibility for a separate property credit upon the distribution of marital property in the event of an “operative event” is determined at the time of the “operative event” and that the party seeking the credit must have contributed  million or more of his or her own separate property directly to the acquisition of the particular item of marital property at issueit is implicit in paragraph e that the length of the parties marriage is to be calculated as of the date of the operative event and not as the wife urges as of the date on which the marital property is distributed moreover the date of the operative event provides certainty that the date of distribution does not provide and it is reasonable to infer that the parties intended that there be certainty with respect to the date their rights to separate property credits and other rights and obligations are determined support for this construction is also provided by clauses stating that “the marital property shall be valued as near as practicable to the time of the operative event” ¶ ei  and that “the distribution contemplated by this paragraph shall occur as quickly as practicable following the happening of an operative event” ¶ eiv  since the operative event occurred before the parties had been married  years the husband is eligible for separate property credits to the extent he contributed  million or more of separate property to the acquisition of any marital propertywe conclude that the wife is correct in regard to the husbands recouping of his separate property the husband must show that he contributed  million or more of separate property to the acquisition of each item of marital property to be distributed rather than that he contributed  million or more in the aggregate to ascertain the parties intentions in regard to the operation of the separate property credit we consider the phrasing of the separate property credit exception of e interpreting it with reference to the apparent purpose of paragraph  and the general purpose of the entire agreement as a whole see generally beal sav bank v sommer  nyd at – the general purpose of the agreement is to provide a degree of protection to both parties in the event the marriage lasted less than  years the agreement protects the husband from the absolute loss of large amounts of separate funds he contributed to the marriage while also protecting the wife from having everything that was purchased for their use as a married couple reclaimed by the husbandthe language of the agreements exception to the rule of dividing marital property equally provides“if the parties have been married for ten  years or less and either party is able to identify one million  dollars or more of separate property that was used for the acquisition of the marital property that party shall first receive the amount of his or her contribution of separate property prior to the division of the remaining value of such property if any” emphasis addedthe use of the definite article before “marital property” and the later reference to “such property” reflect an intent to apply the credit to each piece of marital property as it is being divided a view supported by the subparagraphs that immediately follow which specifically contemplate an itembyitem consideration of the marital property for purposes of its division moreover paragraph d defines “marital property” inter alia as “all property used jointly by the parties with a cost value of  or less” but under the aggregation theory the husband would get all the proceeds of every sale and the wife would lose the benefit of the provision rendering it meaningless indeed given the husbands enormous wealth and the parties stated intention to reside in new york under the aggregation theory the husbands contribution of more than  million to a marital residence alone would meet the threshold rendering the creation of a threshold provision meaninglessthe prenuptial agreement provides that separate property transferred into any form of joint ownership becomes marital property ¶ a  that is separate property placed into joint ownership does not retain its character as separate property thus the husband also must show that he contributed separate property directly to the acquisition of the marital property at issue not merely that he placed his separate property into a joint account from which funds were subsequently withdrawn and used for the purchase of marital property paragraph  of the agreement which defines marital property as property transferred into joint ownership makes no exception for transfers made as a conveniencethe husband failed to demonstrate that he contributed  million or more in separate property to the acquisition of the connecticut parcels and to the parties interest in greycroft partners thus he is not entitled to a separate property credit for his contributions to the acquisition of those propertiesnor is the husband entitled to a credit for separate property he transferred into the parties joint goldman sachs and jp morgan accounts in contrast with paragraph  which specifies that the category includes property “transferred by either party into any form of joint ownership” as well as property “acquired with joint funds acquired out of joint accounts or acquired by use of credit cards in joint name” the separate property credit provision is phrased to apply only to separate property used directly for the “acquisition” of marital property contrary to the husbands contention it is not reasonable to interpret the term “acquisition” so broadly as to include the act of obtaining marital property via transferto the extent marital property is to be distributed under the agreement each party is entitled to appreciation on his or her share which includes postoperative event appreciation on the goldman sachs and jp morgan accountssince the husband showed that approximately  million of his separate property was used to acquire the connecticut residence he is entitled to a separate property credit for that contributionthe husband is not entitled to a credit for the  million paid from the parties joint account at closing on the park avenue apartment although those funds were previously his separate property they became marital property when he transferred them into the joint account since the husbands transfer of separate funds into a joint account transformed those funds into marital property for all purposes when funds from that joint account were then used for the purchase of the parties apartment there was no use of separate property for the acquisition of the apartment in any event there is no evidence that the joint account was established only for convenience or that the fund transfer was merely transitory since the funds remained in the joint account for a month cf wade v steinfeld  add  d dept  money kept in joint account for three days the husband is entitled to a credit for the  million he paid from his separate property for renovation costs on the park avenue apartment we find that the renovation costs expended by the husband from his separate property were inextricably bound to the acquisition of the apartment itself a separate property credit is therefore also properly claimed for the   down payment on the park avenue apartment that the husband paid from his separate property since the  million threshold for the separate property contribution to the apartment has been met findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial

kim velsey •  am guess who got  million for their penthouse patrick mcmullen we bet no calls got dropped when this deal was closing lawrence t babbio jr the former president and vice chair of verizon just sold his sprawling penthouse at  park avenue for  million mr babbio and wife sheri‘s former abode is large enough— rooms in all including a footbyfoot living room and five dramatic terraces yes five—that it might require some telecommunications savvy just to reach the apartment’s other inhabitants fortunately the building was designed by rosario candela so the layout is impeccable oh and there’s feet of park avenue frontage to coo over plus a plethora of floortoceiling and panoramic over windows to gaze at it from the buyers leah and michael weisberg according to city records must have been impressed given that they paid just under the  million ask mr babbio who retired from verizon in  bought the coop before such things were public knowledge so we can’t tell how much of a killing he made in this deal but he should have plenty of cash to keep him warm in his dotage of course as is the case with most retired corporate chiefs mr babbio is staying busy—he’s working as an adviser to private equity firm warburg pincus and naturally serving on a few corporate boards we can’t even see the end of this terrace the weisbergs will be moving in from just up the avenue—they list their address as  park on the deed assuming it’s the same leah weisberg who was interviewed in a  new york times article about buyers shopping for coops on both side of the park—shocking—she’s come down hard in favor of the upper east side then again her budget ceiling is no longer  million and we’re guessing these days even some upper east siders can be found walking around in jogging clothes—one of the advantages of upper west side living that ms weisberg spoke longingly of back then in any event the weisbergs gave the pad a warm reception snapping it up within a month of its march market debut kudos to listing broker john burger of brown harris stevens—this is the second  millionplus deal that he closed at  park this summer a room spread sold for  million in july we guess
