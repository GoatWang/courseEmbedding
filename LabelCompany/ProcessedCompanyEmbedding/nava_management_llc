mechanically ventilated patients comparison between nava and psv modes ann intensive care  sep  how personalized ventilation works during normal respiration a spontaneous breath begins with an impulse generated by the respiratory centers in the brain this impulse is then transmitted via phrenic nerves and electrically activates the diaphragm leading to a muscle contraction the diaphragm contracts into the abdominal cavity which leads to a descending movement creating a negative alveolar pressure and an inflow of air the signal that excites the diaphragm is proportional to the integrated output of the respiratory center in the brain and controls the depth and cycling of the breath with personalized ventilation the electrical discharge of the diaphragm is captured by a special catheter fitted with an array of electrodes the edi catheter and visualized on the ventilator screen this is edi the electrical activity of the diaphragm the edi catheter is placed in the esophagus much like an ordinary feeding tube with nava neurally adjusted ventilatory assist the edi is used to deliver ventilation in time with and in proportion to the diaphragm activity the benefits of edi monitoring the diaphragm is the “heart” of the respiratory system and is designed to be continuously active the edi is a bedside diagnostic tool that allows you to monitor and safeguard the patients diaphragm activity the edi guides weaning and helps you prevent muscular exhaustion during weaning trials even after extubation   how to detect an inactive diaphragm below notice how the pressure curve yellow
