extend your wireless network to all parts of your home its very easy to install but its pricey and performance is mixed luma home wifi system by john r delaney june   pm est june   editors rating good view gallery view all  photos in gallery msrp  pros easy to install and configure builtin security and content filtering good closeproximity throughput in testing cons expensive limited ethernet ports lacks dedicated band control no advanced management settings middling range performance bottom line the luma home wifi system is designed to extend your wireless network to all parts of your home its very easy to install but its pricey and performance is mixed theres a new type of wireless product hitting the market wifi systems use individual modules to create a mesh network that delivers wireless networking to all areas of your home the luma home wifi system  pack or  each joins the eero amplifi and plume systems as the latest modular wifi solution to tout ease of use and wholehouse coverage luma makes it easy to invite users to a guest network and to create filter policies for each user the system delivered good closeproximity throughput in our testing but we found that performance took a hit as we moved away from the main module moreover management options and ports are limited for half the price you can pick up a traditional midrange router like our editors choice linksys ea maxstream ac mumimo gigabit router which delivers much better overall throughput and offers plenty of ports and management settings compare similar products compare linksys ea maxstream ac mumimo gigabit router   eero   asus google onhub srtac   starry station   netgear nighthawk x ac triband wifi router   linksys ac triband gigabit smart wifi router ea   dlink ac ultra wifi router

wireless router   design and features the pack system of routers reviewed here which luma refers to as modules is designed for the typical home but you can add more modules up to ten on a single network if you require more coverage in the box you also get three power supplies and one ethernet cable the hexagonshaped modules are available in white gold orange or silver and measure  by  by  inches hwd theres a round led ring on the face of the module that flashes blue during the initial setup green when configuring the wifi network and red when theres an error the light goes out when everything is up and running the modules communicate with one another via a proprietary mesh network and are designed to be placed within  feet of each other to blanket your home with wifi coverage view all  photos in gallery each module is an ac router and contains a quadcore processor and two radio bands ghz and ghz they are ac routers with a maximum data rate of mbps on the ghz band and mbps on the ghz band as well as support for multiuser multiple input multiple output mumimo data streaming as with the asus google onhub srtac router the luma uses automatic band steering and chooses which band is best based on location and load its a nice feature but it shows up as a single ssid which means you cant dedicate a band to specific devices such as gaming consoles and media servers you only get one gigabit lan port on each module its on the back of the device and is joined by a gigabit wan input and a usb  port the usb port can be used for charging peripherals but at the time of this writing it was not yet able to connect to usb hard drives the luma network is controlled using a mobile app for android and ios users as with the starry station the eero and the asus google onhub routers the luma does not offer a webbased management console and can only be accessed and controlled using a mobile device the app opens to the wifi page which shows the placement of each module in a generic home floor plan it tells you how many luma devices are online as well as your current upload and download speeds swiping the screen to the left brings you to a page where you can see each module by name tapping a module displays the status and ip address for that module the threebar icon on the upperleft corner takes you to the main menu where you can access wifi and account settings launch an online help page and shop for luma devices on amazon wifi settings are limited to changing the networks name and password and enabling the guest network and account settings are limited to changing the name of each module there are no qos firewall or port forwarding settings nor are there settings for creating access schedules parental controls include a content filter policy with five rating levels unrestricted rrated pg pg and g you can apply a rating across the entire network or add users and assign a different level to each user as you see fit when you add a user you can also add their frequently used client devices to make sure the filters are always in place you can use the control page to give users access to your guest network via text or email and to add new luma modules to the network theres also a pause button that instantly switches off internet access across the network until you disable it the luma offers a builtin security feature that continually scans all connected devices for malware and vulnerabilities to hacking and viruses it will quarantine infected devices and attempt to purge them of infections and will send a push alert to your mobile device when something is detected you can check your status by tapping the security icon on the bottom of the home screen installation and performance to install the luma routers you have to download the free android or ios app when you first open the app you press the setup luma button and select how many modules you are installing youll be asked to answer questions such as what type of home you live in singlefamily apartmentcondo or townhouse and how many floors are in your home i chose singlefamily home with two floors basement and main floor you then have to tell the app where your routermodem is located by clicking on an area of your home front back middle upstairs or downstairs and then create a network name and password the app will prompt you to plug in the first luma module connect it to your modem and restart the modem you can then name the module using a list of room names master bedroom kitchen office etc the light ring will spin blue briefly and turn solid blue when the module is initialized press the start wifi button and wait for the light ring to flash green seven times it will turn off when its ready the entire process took less than five minutes for me you can tap add another luma to install additional luma modules or you can opt to add more at a later time when adding more luma modules the process is similar to that of setting up the first module but the app will tell you where to install your next module based on the location of the first device in my case it was the upstairs center of my house it took around one minute to initialize and  seconds for the wifi setup the app had me install the third module in the center of my basement and the installation was as quick as the first two see how we test wireless routers performance in testing was mixed i ran my usual throughput tests but since i could not isolate the radio bands results are based on the lumas bandsteering feature on the closeproximity sameroom test for the main module the one connected to my modem the luma delivered an impressive mbps thats right up there with the linksys ea mbps and much faster than the eero mbps and the asus google onhub mbps the starry station managed mbps on this test on the foot test the lumas score of mbps edged past the eero mbps and beat the asus google onhub mbps handily but couldnt keep pace with the starry station mbps and the linksys ea mbps i ran the same tests on each of the two satellite modules and found that the closeproximity throughput was significantly reduced mbps for the upstairs module and mbps for the basement module while the foot test scores were nearly identical to the main module mbps and mbps respectively conclusion the luma home wifi system is a good bet if you seek simplicity when setting up and maintaining a home wifi network like eero its relatively expensive especially if you need more than three modules to cover your home but technically challenged users will appreciate its builtin parental controls and nohassle security features if you want total control over your network however the luma will likely disappoint in which case youre better off with a traditional device such as the linksys ea maxstream ac mumimo gigabit router our editors choice for midrange routers its about half the price of the luma system offers better throughput performance and is packed with features including
