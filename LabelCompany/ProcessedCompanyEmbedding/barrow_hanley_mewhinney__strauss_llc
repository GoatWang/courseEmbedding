class us equity investment style value portfolio benchmark  sp ® index portfolio benchmark  russell ® value index portfolio assets  mm as of  commingled fund open separate account open mutual fund touchstone value fund tvlix ‡ investment process our approach to the equity market is based on the underlying philosophy that markets are inefficient these inefficiencies can best be exploited through adherence to a valueoriented investment process dedicated to the selection of securities on a bottomup basis we do not attempt to time the market or rotate in and out of broad market sectors as we believe it is difficult if not impossible to add incremental value on a consistent basis by market timing we stay fully invested with a defensive conservative orientation based on our belief that superior returns can be achieved while taking below average risks we implement this strategy by constructing portfolios of individual stocks that reflect all three value characteristics priceearnings and pricebook ratios below the market and dividend yields above the market sp  while we are exacting in our definition of value we are equally demanding in our pursuit of quality companies we look at stocks for what they are  an ownership interest in a business  and never want to own an interest in a company that has a deteriorating business we seek companies with profitability and earnings growth greater than the market our strategy of emphasizing low pricebook ratios as well as high dividend yields provides a measure of protection in down markets helping to preserve assets in periods of economic recovery and rising equity markets profitability and earnings growth are rewarded by the expansion of priceearnings ratios and the generation of excess returns our greatest source of value added comes through individual stock selection the vast experience of barrow hanleys large cap investment team both in absolute terms and in years working together is where the value is added in the qualitative part of the decisionmaking process the barrow hanley team not only has the experience necessary to identify the reasons for a temporary undervaluation of a companys shares in the market
