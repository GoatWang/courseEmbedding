limited liability company or llc is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership like a corporation the owners of an llc are not personally liable for business debts like a sole proprietorship or partnership an llc has operating flexibility and is a passthrough entity for tax purposes this means the llcs profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the llc what legal documents do i need to form an llc to create an llc articles of organization must be filed with the secretary of state or appropriate state agency next the llc members should enter into an operating agreement which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company an llc may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the irs legalzoom can prepare all of the required documents for you can my llc have an unlimited lifespan yes recent changes to the irs code have promoted changes in state laws permitting llcs to be created with an unlimited life what is the difference between a member and a manager of an llc a member is an owner of the llc and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation a manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the llc and is similar to a director of a corporation a manager can also be a member does an llc have to hold meetings the answer is usually no unless the llcs operating agreement requires meetings legalzooms operating agreements make meetings optional this is one of the key advantages of an llc  fewer formalities this means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection how much will it cost to form and operate an llc each state charges an annual
