intermarket competition the exchange notes that it operates in a highly competitive market in which market participants can readily favor competing venues if they deem fee levels at a particular venue

compliance with the statutory standards applicable to exchanges because competitors are free to modify their own fees in response and because market participants may readily adjust their order routing practices the exchange believes that the degree to which fee changes in this market may impose any burden on competition is extremely limited the question of whether the prices of depthofview products are constrained by competitive forces was examined in  by an administrative law judge in an application for review by the securities industry and financial markets association of actions taken by selfregulatory organizations after a fourday hearing and presentation of substantial evidence the administrative law judge stated that ‘‘competition plays a significant role in restraining exchange pricing of depthofbook products’’  because ‘‘depthofbook products from different exchanges function as substitutes for each other’’  and as such ‘‘the threat of substitution from depthofbook customers constrains their depthofbook prices’’  in addition the administrative law judge stated that ‘‘shifts in order flow and threats of shifting order flow provide a significant competitive force in the pricing of    depthofbook data’’  as such nasdaq’s depthofbook fees are ‘‘constrained by significant competitive forces’’  as an example of the impact of market forces on the price of proprietary data

exchanges and other entities attracting order flow firms make decisions regarding depthofbook products and other proprietary data based on the total cost of interacting with the exchange and order

by entities that offer proprietary data third competition among distributors for customers will further constrain the cost of totalview mstockstill on dskjtprod with notices competition for order flow fees related to totalview are constrained by competition among exchanges and other entities seeking to attract order flow order flow is the ‘‘life blood’’ of the exchanges brokerdealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow including selfregulatory organization ‘‘sro’’ markets as well as internalizing brokerdealers ‘‘bds’’ and various forms of alternative trading systems ‘‘atss’’ including dark pools and electronic communication networks ‘‘ecns’’ each sro market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions and two finraregulated trade reporting facilities ‘‘trfs’’ compete to attract internalized transaction reports the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of bds which may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowestcost trading venues the level of competition and contestability in the market for order flow is demonstrated by the numerous examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers archipelago bloomberg tradebook island redibook attain tracecn and the bats exchanges a proliferation of dark pools and other atss operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume for a variety of reasons competition from new entrants especially for order

do or have announced plans to do so including nyse nyse amex nyse arca the bats exchanges and iex this is because regulation nms deregulated the market for proprietary data while bds had previously published their proprietary data individually regulation nms encourages market data vendors and bds to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible order routers and market data vendors can facilitate production of proprietary data products for single or multiple bds the potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless the markets for order flow and proprietary data are inextricably linked a trading platform cannot generate market information unless it receives trade orders as a result the competition for order flow constrains the prices that platforms can charge for proprietary data products firms make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume based on the total cost of interacting with nasdaq and other exchanges data fees are but one factor in a total platform analysis if the cost of the product exceeds its expected value the brokerdealer will choose not to buy it a supracompetitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or proprietary data has the potential to impair revenues from both products in this manner the competition for order flow will constrain prices for proprietary data products substitute products the price of depthofbook data is constrained by the existence of competition from other exchanges such as nyse and the bats exchanges which sell proprietary depthofbook data while a small number of highly sophisticated traders purchase depthofbook products from multiple exchanges most customers do not because most customers would not pay an excessive price for totalview when substitute data is available from other proprietary sources the exchange is constrained in its pricing decisions competition among distributors competition among distributors provides another form of price discipline for proprietary data products to ensure that fees are equitable fair reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory if the price of totalview po  frm  fmt  sfmt   were set above

in an application for review by the securities industry and financial markets association of actions taken by self regulatory organizations after a fourday hearing and presentation of substantial evidence the administrative law judge stated that competition plays a significant role in restraining exchange pricing of depthofbook products  because depthofbook products from different exchanges function as substitutes for each other  and as such the threat of substitution from depthofbook customers constrains their depthofbook prices  in addition the administrative law judge stated that shifts in order flow and threats of shifting order flow provide a significant competitive force in the pricing of    depthofbook data  as such nasdaqs depthofbook fees are constrained by significant competitive forces  as an example of the impact of market forces on the price of proprietary data the exchange recently lowered the nasdaq basic enterprise license fee for the distribution of certain information by brokerdealers from  to    securities industry and financial markets association initial decision release no   sec lexis  alj june    id at   id  id  id at   id at   see securities exchange act release no  december    fr  december   srnasdaq fee decrease for an enterprise license for the distribution of nasdaq basic to nonprofessional and professional subscribers with whom the brokerdealer has a brokerage relationship  page  the proposed changes will integrate nasdaq totalview and openview into a single depthofbook product if the proposed product revisions are unattractive to market participants it is likely that the exchange will lose market share market forces constrain fees for totalview like all depthofbook products in three respects first all fees related to totalview are constrained by competition among exchanges and other entities attracting order flow firms make decisions regarding depthofbook products and other proprietary data based on the total cost of interacting with the exchange and order flow would be harmed by the supracompetitive pricing of any proprietary data product second the prices of totalview are constrained by the existence of substitutes that are offered or may be offered by entities that offer proprietary data third competition among distributors for customers will further constrain the cost of totalview competition for order flow fees related to totalview are constrained by competition among exchanges and other entities seeking to attract order flow order flow is the life blood of the exchanges brokerdealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow including self regulatory organization sro markets as well as internalizing brokerdealers bds and various forms of alternative trading systems atss including dark pools and electronic communication networks ecns each sro market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions and two finraregulated trade reporting facilities trfs compete to attract internalized transaction reports the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of bds which may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowestcost trading venues the level of competition and contestability in the market for order flow is demonstrated by the numerous examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers archipelago bloomberg tradebook island redibook attain tracecn and the bats exchanges a proliferation of dark pools and other atss operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume for a variety of reasons competition from new entrants especially for order execution has increased dramatically over the last decade each sro trf ats and bd that competes for order flow is permitted to produce proprietary data products many currently do or have announced plans to do so including nyse nyse amex nyse arca the bats exchanges and iex this is because regulation nms deregulated the market for proprietary data while bds had previously published their proprietary data individually regulation nms encourages market data vendors and bds to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible order routers and market data vendors can facilitate production of proprietary data products for single or multiple bds the potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless the markets for order flow and proprietary data are inextricably linked a trading platform cannot generate market information unless it receives trade orders as a result the competition for order flow constrains the prices that platforms can charge for proprietary data products firms make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume based on the total cost of interacting with nasdaq and other exchanges data fees are but one factor in a total platform analysis if the cost of the product exceeds its expected value the broker dealer will choose not to buy it a supracompetitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or proprietary data has the potential to impair revenues from both products in this manner the competition for order flow will constrain prices for proprietary data products substitute products the price of depthofbook data is constrained by the existence of competition from other exchanges such as nyse and the bats exchanges which sell proprietary depthofbook data while a small number of highly sophisticated traders purchase depthofbook products from multiple exchanges most customers do not because most customers would not pay an excessive price for totalview when substitute data is available from other proprietary sources the exchange is constrained in its pricing decisions competition among distributors competition among distributors provides another form of price discipline for proprietary data products to ensure that fees are equitable fair reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory if the price of totalview were set above competitive levels distributors purchasing totalview would be at a disadvantage relative to their competitors and would therefore either purchase a substitute or forego the product altogether in summary market forces constrain the price of depthofbook data such as totalview through competition for order flow competition from substitute products and in the competition among vendors for customers c selfregulatory organizations statement

little historical background can help you put stock market declines in perspective types of stock market declines a look back at stock market history since  shows that declines have varied widely in intensity length and frequency in the midst of a decline it’s been nearly impossible to tell the difference between a slight dip and a more prolonged correction the table below shows that declines in the dow jones industrial average have been somewhat regular events a history of declines –december  type of decline average frequency average length last occurrence – or more about  times a year  days august  – or more about once a year  days august  – or more about once every  years  days october  – or more about once every ½ years  days march  source capital research and management company assumes  recovery rate of lost value measures market high to market low lessons learned from market declines living with a market decline isn’t easy but if you understand these  key lessons you’ll be a more intelligent investor no one can predict consistently when market declines will happen it’s easy to look back today and say with hindsight that the stock market was overvalued at a particular time and due for a decline but no one has been able to accurately predict market declines on a consistent basis in january  a new york times poll of  market authorities predicted that the market would “move somewhat higher” in the future the dow industrials proceeded to decline  over the next  months then although almost no one predicted it the dow rose  in  no one can predict how long a decline will last since  with few exceptions market declines have been relatively brief earlier market declines have lasted longer after the  crash it took investors  years to restore their investments if they invested at the market high in  it took about  years but after the  crash it took about  months to get back in  it took about  months in all cases dividends were assumed to be reinvested no one can consistently predict the right time to get in or out of the market successful market timing during a decline is extremely difficult because it requires a pair of nearperfect actions getting out and then getting back in at the right time a common mistake investors make is to lose patience and sell at or near the bottom of a downturn but even if you have decent timing and get out early in a decline you still have to figure out when to get back in a bear market is not usually characterized by a straightline decline in stock prices instead the market’s downward trend is likely to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases known as “sucker’s rallies” and then declines be sure to talk to your financial professional before making any changes to your financial plan other resources
