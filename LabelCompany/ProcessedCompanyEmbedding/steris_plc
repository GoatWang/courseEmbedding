bit of a froggy voice this morning i hope im not too hard to hear as mike will discuss shortly we ended fiscal year  strong and feel good about where we stand today and even better about where were headed tomorrow fiscal  was a transition year for steris as we took strategic actions to improve the business for the longterm we have completed the bulk of the synergy health integration efforts and have divested businesses that do not fit our go forward strategy we achieved  constant currency organic revenue growth in fiscal  a good showing in todays market we had a particularly strong fourth quarter ending the year on a high note the actions we have taken have delivered results beyond revenue growth which are apparent in the expansion of both – in both gross margins and operating income margins overall operating margins improved by  basis points in the year resulting in a record  of sales we also achieved another double digit increase in adjusted earnings per share for the full year to  i will spend a few moments on the highlights of the year for each of our segments before getting into our outlook for fiscal  starting with our largest segment healthcare products revenue grew  on a constant currency organic basis for the year consumables were strong excluding the impact of divestitures as we benefited from continued midsingle digit growth in our instrument cleaning chemistries doubledigit growth in us endoscopy and our vpro consumables equipment service revenue continued its history of consistent growth particularly in installation of our or integration offerings and an increase in preventive maintenance contracts capital equipment shipments started the year a bit slow but ended very strong for the full year we saw particular strength in washers and steam sterilizers on the infection prevention side of our business and or integration in our surgical business unit healthcare specialty services grew constant currency organic revenue  for the year with improving profitability in the fourth quarter our people in ims have done a nice job winning new contracts during the year and as we said last quarter we expect that portion of our business to reach highsingle digit operating margin run rates by the end of fiscal  combined with the divestitures of the lower profitability businesses our expectation is to bring the profitability of the entire segment to midsingle digits for the full year in applied sterilization technologies revenue grew  for the year on a constant currency organic basis reflecting strong underlying demand from our core medical device customers of course the fall in the euro and british pound offset much of this growth outside the united states on an asreported basis as you all know we have been making investments in ast to expand capacity at a number of facilities and growth investments will continue in fiscal  these are sound expansions with return on investment capital typically exceeding our cost of capital in a three to four year timeframe however we do not expect to see the same level of margin expansion next year for the level of growth we anticipate due to the startup costs and higher level of depreciation on these new facilities we do not expect profit dollars to fall as a result of these investments they just will not expand as fast as they would for the level of growth we anticipate we look forward to significant margin expansions in fy  and beyond as a result of these investments life science constant currency organic revenue increased  led by high singledigit consumable revenue growth we had strength in both barrier products and formulated chemistries with particular strength in europe service revenue grew doubledigits for the year with growth in maintenance contracts and new service offerings capital equipment revenue ended the year slightly below our expectations but with strong orders in hand we have a doubledigit percentage increase in backlog to a record  million which is a good start for next year turning to our outlook for fiscal  we expect another year of solid performance this is our tenth year together as a team and we have successfully delivered on our longterm commitments for growth and adjusted earnings per share over that period despite substantial challenges and headwinds along the way our revenue has grown  compounded and our adjusted earnings per share  as i have said since i arrived at steris i believe this is a business that can grow revenue mid to highsingle digits through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions and leverage that growth to deliver doubledigit bottom line expansion our management team has accomplished this goal the past  years and i believe we will continue to do so the next  years we have macro forces that will continue to help drive growth in procedures and vaccines the baby boom population reaching peak health care spending ages in the us and other industrialized countries and the growing middle class outside the industrialized world we are a recognized global leader in sterilization and decontamination with strength in hospitals and surgery centers pharmaceutical manufacturing of biologics and vaccines and medical device sterilization we also have focus on additional products and services for the procedural areas of surgery and endoscopy in addition to revenue growth we have plenty of opportunity to become a more efficient business using lean techniques in both our operations and our support functions specific to fiscal  we anticipate that as reported revenue will decline  to  reflecting lost revenue of approximately  million from the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions also factored into that outlook is a  million degradation to revenue from foreign currency movements our outlook presumes that we will complete the last of our planned divestitures in the first quarter of fiscal  this business represents about  million of the total  million of divested revenue for the year we have not assumed any additional acquisitions divestitures in our fy  outlook beyond those that have occurred or ive discussed we continue to believe that there are acquisition opportunities before us but the timing of deal completion is difficult to predict we believe our underlying revenue growth on a constantcurrency organic basis will be in the range of  to  for the year with solid growth in all four segments driving that performance with the benefit of cost synergies and the impact of divestitures we expect another year of meaningful improvement in operating margins largely stemming from improvement in gross margins as always we plan to reinvest some of our savings in particular we anticipate doubledigit growth in rd spending in fy  and significant capital spending for expansion opportunities as we noted in our release we anticipate adjusted earnings per diluted share for fiscal  to be in the range of  to  as we have seen in prior years we expect our earnings to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year fiscal  earnings comparisons to fiscal  will be a bit light in the first half compared to prior years as we have tougher comparisons on foreign exchange as well as the impact of lost profit dollars from divestitures this is particularly true of the first quarter where have the largest headwind of lost profit from divestitures all in all we expect  of our earnings to be in the first half of the fiscal year and  in the second half as we look ahead were excited about the opportunities before us we have a great team in place are positioned nicely for future growth and have both breadth and depth in our core businesses with significant opportunities to grow we will continue our mission to help our customers create a healthy and safer world ill turn the call over to mike to review the quarter before we open for qa michael michael j tokich  steris plc thank you walt and good morning everyone it is once again my pleasure to be with you this morning to review our fourth quarter adjusted financial results we ended the year strong with total constant currency organic revenue growth of  in the fourth quarter driven by volume and  basis points of price gross margin as a percentage of revenue for the quarter increased  basis points to  the improvement in gross margin was due to the impact of divested businesses favorable foreign currency cost synergies and pricing partially offset by product mix ebit margin at  of revenue for the quarter represents a  basis point improvement reflecting the positive contributors to gross margin somewhat offset by an increase of  in rd expenditures we are very pleased with our continued ability to expand ebit margins and leverage revenue growth the effective tax rate in the quarter was  down substantially from the prior year and slightly lower than our expectations as we had favorable discrete item adjustments in the quarter this puts our full year fiscal  effective tax rate at  we anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of  to  for the full fiscal year  net income in the quarter increased  to  million or  per diluted share benefiting from organic revenue growth continued margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate moving on to our segment results healthcare products segment as reported revenue grew  in the quarter while constant currency organic revenue grew  capital led the way with a revenue increase of  while service revenue grew  this growth was offset by a  decline in consumable revenue caused by the divestiture of our skin care business which reduced revenue by  million in the quarter within capital equipment we saw strength in our or integration offering steamed sterilizers and washers during the quarter backlog in healthcare products declined  million to  million in the quarter reflecting fourth quarter strong capital equipment shipments healthcare products operating income increased  and operating margins improved by  basis points to  of revenue in the quarter the margin increase is due primarily to the increase in volume improvement in gross margin and the impact of divestitures revenue for healthcare specialty services increased  on a constant currency organic basis with strength in ims and the legacy synergy csd outsourcing business in europe healthcare specialty services operating income for the fourth quarter increased sequentially by over  from  million to  million on a sequential sales decline of  recall that during the quarter we divested our remaining linens business in the netherlands applied sterilization technologies grew revenue  on a constant currency organic basis bolstered by a rebound in volume following the light december sales period applied sterilization technologies operating margin at  of revenue was down  basis points primarily due to the impact of foreign currency movements we expect this fx pressure on profitability to continue into the first half of fiscal  remember that the currency decline in the euro and british pound did not significantly impact our results in this segment until the third quarter of fiscal  life sciences as reported revenue for the quarter grew  we continue to see goods consumable revenue growth in the quarter of  offset by lumpy capital equipment shipments which were down  and a decline in service revenue of  constant currency organic revenue growth was  in the quarter our capital equipment orders in life sciences ended the quarter strong growing backlog to a record  million life sciences fourth quarter operating margin declined  basis points to  due in part to increased rd spending and unfavorable product mix within capital equipment revenue in terms of the balance sheet we ended the quarter with  million of cash  billion in total debt and a debttoebitda leverage ratio of just under  times without additional acquisitions we anticipate leverage by the end of fiscal year  to be approximately  times debttoebtida as this happens we will be approaching or passing our optimum level of leverage and we will likely move away from our recent emphasis on lowering our leverage ratio and instead return our focus to our traditional capital allocation priorities maintaining and growing the dividend reinvesting in our businesses funding acquisitions and share repurchases during the quarter we took advantage of locking in low longterm favorable financing rates as we issued and sold approximately  million of fixed rate senior notes in a private placement substantially all of the proceeds were used to repay floating rate bank debt thereby increasing our portion of fixed rate debt the result was a shift from floating rate debt to somewhat higher cost fixed rate debt which will lead to an increase in net interest expense in the coming year in total our current expectations for interest expense is about  million in fiscal  free cash flow for the year was  million almost double compared to last year primarily due to higher cash from operations which was partially driven by a reduction in acquisitionrelated cash expenses included in free cash flow for fiscal  is approximately  million of cash expenses related to acquisitions and divestitures we anticipate a reduction of approximately  million in related cash expenses in fiscal  for the full fiscal year  we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  million reflecting continued facility expansions integration of it systems new product development and general maintenance for existing facilities total depreciationamortization for fiscal  is expected to be approximately  million which includes about  million in amortization of acquired intangible assets for the full fiscal year  we returned approximately  million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks the balance of cash was utilized to repay debt and to acquire several small businesses with that i will now turn the call over to julie to begin qa julie julie winter  steris plc thank you walt and mike for your comments jamie if you would please give the instructions we can get started on qa questionandanswer session operator ladies and gentlemen at this time well begin the questionandanswer session well pause momentarily to assemble the roster and our first question today comes from larry keusch from raymond james please go ahead with your question lawrence keusch  raymond james  associates inc thanks good morning everyone walter m rosebrough  steris plc morning larry lawrence keusch  raymond james  associates inc morning walt andor mike maybe we could just start at a very high level and given some of the distractions from  with the divestitures and integrating synergy and of course some of the challenges achieving some of the top line goals can you talk a little about philosophically how you came into  and kind of what do you view driving that top and bottom end of that organic constant currency range of  to  walter m rosebrough  steris plc larry i would say in terms of the approach first of all obviously some of the businesses that we divested were disappointing to us they were not in our strategic wheelhouse anyway and they were doing not as well as we expected so for both short and longterm reasons it made sense to make those divestitures and let someone else do with them something that probably better than we could and so that clearly impacted our last year in terms of i would say forecast going forward we forecast as we always do and have as we do bottomup forecast in our business units we also look at the top to see if it makes sense to us visavis whats going on in the marketplace and we look at those two things in concert and we put out the forecast we think is a reasonable forecast we do on the one hand want to stretch our people and our operations to do the best we can on the other hand we obviously dont want to put forecasts out there we dont meet if we look at it in total i think weve done a pretty decent job of that last year was obviously a disappointment lawrence keusch  raymond james  associates inc okay and are there any drivers for the top and bottom end of that  to  range walter m rosebrough  steris plc the answer is of course yes the kind of the classic questions around capital both forms of capital life science and healthcare life science tends to be a little bit lumpy this year we have more confidence going into the year in that we do see that pipeline and we have a very good backlog so probably were a little more comfortable than normal on that side of the business on the healthcare side of the business again this question always comes up with the pipeline out there how are things looking particularly in the united states so far we have seen continuation of the trend weve been talking about for a year or two that is its not growing rapidly but we continue to see a reasonable pipeline its up a few digits if you will and we have continued to see that i would say weve seen kind of particular strength on the project side of the business that is people who have made strategic decisions to put steel in the ground or to refurbish major parts of their facilities are continuing that at the pace that we have been seeing and we havent seen significant changes on the replacement side of the house as well so it looks like a continuation of the future as you all know there are a lot of things up in the air right now in us health care the way its going to be reimbursed what happens with the affordable care act and so were all watching that carefully but weve not seen any indication from our hospital customers that they are pulling back on capital spending at this point and in fact youve seen a number of announcements by the forprofit side of the world about how they are going forward with strong capital spending lawrence keusch  raymond james  associates inc okay and then just quickly on free cash flow i think for  you had guided to  million you obviously did a little bit better  million and included in that was about  million of spending related to the synergy acquisition so i was thinking that cash flow given the growth in the business – free cash flow i should say would have been  million or perhaps a bit better youre guiding a little bit below that are there any sort of stepups that we should be thinking about looks like capex is up a bit yearoveryear michael j tokich  steris plc yes larry youre right capex is up a little bit yearoveryear and also we are anticipating another about  million of cash expenses related to acquisitions and divestitures so if you take our free cash flow add the  million were just over that  million mark on a little bit of an increase in our capex lawrence keusch  raymond james  associates inc okay perfect thanks so much guys operator our next question comes from joel kaufman from goldman sachs please go ahead with your question joel harrison kaufman  goldman sachs  co hi yes thanks for the question just following up on the organic growth guidance just maybe help us walk through the process again because when i frame down the top – frame the topdown views of the market you just provided and the portfolio today relative to the portfolio when you guys provided guidance on the fourth quarter call last year one could argue that the weighted average market growth rate of your assets today is more attractive than it was  months ago just trying to understand what brought down the outlook relative to the  target you guys provided last year walter m rosebrough  steris plc well we agree with you the weighted average of the current business is stronger than the weighted average of the business last year i think it goes without saying we were obviously over aggressive in our forecast last year we didnt meet that forecast and we did take that into account when we looked at these numbers i would not call this an overly conservative forecast i think its a reasonable forecast and we intend to hit it but clearly we were over optimistic last year but i agree with your standpoint if we had the same portfolio that we had last year we would be guiding even lower than we are today joel harrison kaufman  goldman sachs  co okay thanks then just turning to the ast business obviously the growth there has been fairly strong coming in a little bit ahead of what i would say is sort of the contributors across the med dev device volumes were so can you maybe just help us understand whats driving the growth there is it a market share dynamic is it a pricing dynamic thanks walter m rosebrough  steris plc sure first of all we do get modest price increases in that business over time and those are longterm contractual increases so we do get modest price increases thats a small portion but the other side of that is indeed a combination of market growth and you have to remember on the device side devices particularly implantable devices have been under some significant price pressure the last several years and in that space we count volume is what drives our business not so much the price the end user price of the business were an ever an infinitesimal piece of their cost so we tend to ride with volume not with their end market prices and i do think over time that we have picked up some share predominantly from some of the smaller players in the marketplace joel harrison kaufman  goldman sachs  co thanks and then just last one on capital allocation appreciate the comments that as you guys approach the optimal leverage target you guys are going to be thinking about getting back to a more traditional pattern of cap allocation is anything changed in terms of your priorities between share repurchase and smaller tuckins relative to what it wouldve been prior to the synergy health acquisition walter m rosebrough  steris plc no i would say not at all those are our rank order priorities they were before the deal and they continue to be post joel harrison kaufman  goldman sachs  co thanks guys operator and our next question comes from matt mishan from keybanc please go ahead with your question matthew mishan  keybanc capital markets inc hey good morning thanks for taking the questions julie winter  steris plc hey matt matthew mishan  keybanc capital markets inc could you just give us a sense of the trajectory youre expecting this year and maybe into next year for like revenue growth and operating margins for specifically the healthcare specialty services segment that seems like thats been a laggard over the course of  but you saw some really nice improvement last quarter and i think it especially in the outsource central sterile processing side youre starting to see some pretty good volumes there walter m rosebrough  steris plc you know i would say theres a couple – theres different components of that and clearly the europound impacted our european business on including currency basis on a constant currency basis we do see growth in that business the traditionally european business the – what we have historically called the ims business or the instrument repair portion of that business which is largely in north america has seen some nice growth and you know this past year we lost a pretty significant chunk of business from a couple of customers and as a result our growth rate was not as high as we expected but even with that loss we still had reasonable growth rates for the year midsingle digit growth rates we are toning down our view of that a little bit when we did the acquisition we were saying highsingle to lowdouble digits we think that market has matured some in this past several years and so probably more in the midsingle to maybe a little north of a midsingle but in that range of midsingle digits as opposed to what we have historically said in terms of our outlook michael j tokich  steris plc and i would also add matt that you know from a profitability standpoint the divestitures had put a lot of pressure on that segment and you have seen with the removal of all of our linen businesses youre starting to see that uptick of profit in the right direction matthew mishan  keybanc capital markets inc okay and in the outsource central sterile processing since you closed on synergy health have you guys opened or signed any new contracts on outsourcing centers either here or in the uk and then what does the pipeline look for that moving forward walter m rosebrough  steris plc the answer to the question is we have signed outsourcing contracts both in the us and the uk those contracts in the us have tended to be or have all been i should say inside the existing facility as opposed to building a center and doing what the you know kind of the traditional european outsource we have also signed additional contracts both in the uk and in europe and so we have brought contracts on board some of those were as ive just described inside the facility some of those were reupping historic contracts and some were we anticipate building some facilities or putting facilities in place or refurbishing facilities it is going to require capital the other one that weve obviously talked about a fair amount is northwell and we continue to expect that to go but we intend – we expect that to happen next year not this fiscal year in any significant revenue way we do have capital in our forecast for new facilities a we have capital for the northwell facility and we have capital for some other facilities but we would not expect any material revenue at this point for this current year matthew mishan  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then last question for mike i think the segment margins were all pretty strong in the quarter but in the other line you saw a little bit of a spike there can you elaborate on what drove like the  million in costs in the other line michael j tokich  steris plc yes part of that was – remember we dont allocate all of our costs across to all of the businesses we withhold a portion of not only the defense industrial business but also other costs related to legacy pension postretirement board expenses walt and my expenses so it was just a timing issue on that for the year weve seen a slight increase in our expenses for some of those items especially with synergy health on the pension side which we are holding at the corporate level matthew mishan  keybanc capital markets inc thank you very much mike walter m rosebrough  steris plc youre welcome matt operator our next question comes from chris cooley from stephens please go ahead with your question chris cooley  stephens inc thank you appreciate you taking the questions here this morning mike maybe just if youd go back on the backlog in life sciences was a little bit intrigued by that growth hitting that record level of  million could you just talk about what youre seeing as a backdrop there maybe from a big picture standpoint historically thats been kind of a weaker spot i realize its lumpy but again just kind of a little surprised to see that perk up and would like to get a little color there and then ive got a followup michael j tokich  steris plc certainly as you know chris the majority of our customers in that are the pharmaceutical facilities and the research institutions and we have continued to see very good growth coming out of the pharma side as they get back to ill call a more normalized growth trajectory so a large portion of our orders are coming from the pharmaceutical side and as we continue to talk about obviously life sciences tends to be a lot more lumpy from a capital equipment shipments and when we dont ship that it automatically falls into backlog their products are a lot more highly customized and a lot larger in volume so really a lot of it is just timing we saw capital shipments down but we are experiencing very good order growth rates in particular on the pharma side walter m rosebrough  steris plc and chris i would add we have introduced a number of new products in that space the last year or so both on the steam sterilization side and on the hydrogen peroxide sterilization side and particularly hydrogen peroxide i think is gaining ground in that space so i believe thats a part of the impetus to the growth so theres the pharma market seems – our piece of the pharma market the vaccines the biologics tend to be strong and a lot of the consolidation seems to be kind of past us if you will in terms of plant consolidation to the point mike made but weve also had some nice products to go into that space chris cooley  stephens inc thats super and then maybe if i could just go back to kind of a prior round of questioning when you think about the buildup for this years guide candidly the top line organic growth rate looks pretty much as we had expected but i would appreciate just some color around what youre expecting in terms of maybe domestic and global volumes because i think thats really what i think what investors in general are trying to kind of build back up here what do you think well see will we see a steady state type environment in terms of normal surgical procedure volume are you anticipating any moderation in growth just want to think about how we build that up through the fiscal year thanks so much walter m rosebrough  steris plc yeah chris i would say at a high level as you know the international volumes the last year or  months have been weak relative to the us volumes and we do expect – we have seen in the pacific rim an increase in our business and we do expect that to continue in our forecast latin america has been weak we believe were seeing a bottoming out of that so we may be seeing a bottom and maybe a bit of an uptick in europe weve actually held nicely over this period but the middle east which we put the europe and the middle east together the middle east has been down radically is the only right term and so the european business has not been able to offset the middle eastern portion of that business we in our forecast here we do expect growth in the european business too so we are expecting to see better growth in the ous business than we have seen the last year or so now im talking about the healthcare hospital side of the business not life science and ast because theyve experienced nice growth globally all during that period chris cooley  stephens inc super thanks so much operator our next question comes from david stratton from great lakes review please go ahead with your question david m stratton  great lakes review morning thanks for the question when we look at the healthcare specialty services the improved profitability when you break that out from the divestiture whats the underlying profitability there and kind of the trend ongoing walter m rosebrough  steris plc we dont get into detail of the numbers at that level but clearly our profitability fell in that space as we lost some business and we had invested in front of gaining what we thought was more business and so what is going on is the cost that weve invested are catching up – as we grow the revenue the revenue is catching up to the cost and thats the principle improvement we do think if we can grow the revenue as we anticipate this current year that we will see the profitability ending the year as weve described so thats really the issue we do not expect significant cost growth relative to the revenue growth we anticipate david m stratton  great lakes review okay thank you and then on the life sciences side i know you framed the decline in capital equipment sales as lumpy and then how does that translate into the services is that also lumpy or what kind of led that decline walter m rosebrough  steris plc yes services is not as lumpy as capital it tends to be more stable but there are a couple of components of service in the life science space as well as the healthcare space that are we do a large amount of installation service and so obviously when we sell equipment we get that installation so if were off in off on the sale of the equipment maybe in the same quarter or maybe in the next quarter the timing differs depending on when the project was shipped and installed but it is lumpy along with the capital business we also have a fair amount of business particularly in the water stills that we sell in europe where they basically are refurbishing a water still and so they will get significant and these are pretty significant orders theyll get orders for parts that runs through our service business its really a refurb if you will of that equipment and so our parts sometimes are lumpy because of that david m stratton  great lakes review thank you operator and our next question comes from mitra ramgopal from sidoti please go ahead with your question mitra ramgopal  sidoti  co llc yes hi good morning just a couple of questions walt you mentioned about increased rd and i was just wondering if you could give us a sense as to some of the areas you feel you need to expand upon walter m rosebrough  steris plc well the short answer is we think there are some opportunities for rd the – couple of different issues as our us endoscopy business grows and our ori business grows those businesses are more rd intensive than some of our others so that – those two businesses as they grow as a overall percentage rise – raise our overall level of rd the second area is when were doing rd projects the end of a project has a number of expenses like prototypes and market testing and all those things where you get a spike in rd and we do have a number of projects that we expect to enter that phase this year and so we will see some spike there too mitra ramgopal  sidoti  co llc okay thanks and then back to synergy i know its been about a yearandahalf now since you completed the acquisition if you had to sort of look back and grade it in terms of how its progressed versus your expectations regarding things like the divestitures the expected cost synergies et cetera what would you say walter m rosebrough  steris plc well just walking through the high level the cost reduction as a result or cost synergies if you will are on track and if anything are better than we expected in total the – ill call it the strategy and market position which is the principal reason we did it both in the ast and the hss side we feel very good about that ive been i guess i would say on the ast side i am more positive than i was going into it on the hss side we always knew that there was going to be some – that would be a longterm revenue increase and we still think thats a longterm revenue increase but it is going to take time its a nascent business in the us so i dont feel better or worse about that clearly some of the – ill call them ancillary businesses the businesses that neither – synergy had always described that they would be exiting the laundry business if they could in an appropriate way for example but the – ill call them the ancillary businesses that came along with the synergy acquisition they were not performing as well as what we had hoped and thats why we accelerated the disposition because we felt it made sense to – again to put that in someones hands who thinks its strategic and will do a nice job with it and thats not an area we wanted to expend resources and when we got into it and saw the work that we would have to do in some respects ill call it for lack of better terms the regulatory and finance work that we would need to do to handle sarbanesoxley and to handle some of the regulatory issues that we have in the us that are not present in europe that we felt it was wise to accelerate those as opposed to spending the money to turn them into those kind of compliances and then spin – and spin them out so we accelerated that that was a little disappointing but not strategic in any way mitra ramgopal  sidoti  co llc thanks very helpful and then finally you mentioned europe continues to be a bright spot i assume brexit will be a nonissue for you there as you see it walter m rosebrough  steris plc well youve got to ask theresa may that question mitra ramgopal  sidoti  co llc thats a wild card walter m rosebrough  steris plc i would definitely not characterize brexit as a nonissue i will say the – theres – the plus and minus for us in terms of trade the preponderance particularly in the synergy business is local service business so theres not a trade barrier kind of issue there because it tends to be done inside of the individual country so that from that standpoint brexit is largely a nonissue now the historic steris business we do have facilities in france and facilities in the uk and we trade across boundaries not just between the us and france and finland for that matter but we trade across the world from those facilities so how trade is handled between the uk and everybody else is not trivial to us we care its not a huge piece of our business most of our manufacturing is in the us so at a high level kind of those are the answers the real issue for us probably bigger than anything is currency fluctuation and currency fluctuation is relevant to us particularly since in those service businesses both the cost and the revenues are in currency if you will and as a result the profits fluctuate directly with the currency when you translate it back to us dollars so that is relevant to us again if you have a basket of currencies if they all move in concert with the us dollar we tend to be fairly – it changes our revenues but it doesnt affect our profitability that much but if any particular currency moves it can have an impact mitra ramgopal  sidoti  co llc okay thats great again thanks for taking the questions operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time weve reached the end of todays questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference call back
