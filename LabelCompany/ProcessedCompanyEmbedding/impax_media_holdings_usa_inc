laboratories inc nasdaq ipxl today announced that the us food and drug administration fda approved rytary an extendedrelease oral capsule formulation of carbidopalevodopa for the treatment of parkinsons disease postencephalitic parkinsonism and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication and  or manganese intoxication rytary is not for use in patients using nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors mao inhibitors logo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhphlogo the fda approval of rytary pronounced ryetaree is an important new development for the treatment of parkinsons disease and provides an extendedrelease carbidopalevodopa product that treats parkinsons disease said fred wilkinson  president and ceo impax laboratories rytary is designed to address one of the most significant unmet needs for patients living with parkinsons disease which is to reduce the amount of time during the day when their symptoms are not adequately controlled  there are approximately one million americans living with this chronic disease and we are pleased to offer this new therapy as a treatment option for those patients added wilkinson todays approval of rytary is also a significant milestone for impax because it is our first branded drug internally developed and approved for commercialization rytary contains immediate release and extendedrelease beads with a specific amount of carbidopa and levodopa in a  ratio and provides both initial and extended levodopa plasma concentrations after a single dose rytary may be swallowed whole or for patients who have trouble swallowing the capsule may be opened and the beads sprinkled on applesauce and consumed immediately impax expects the four strengths of rytary mgmg mgmg mgmg and mgmg carbidopalevodopa to be available for commercial distribution in february  the rytary clinical program studied patients with early levodopanaive to advanced parkinsons disease in the us and in europe in apexpd study  a trial that enrolled and randomized  levodopanaive patients the study met its primary efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline in the sum of unified parkinsons disease rating scale updrs part ii activities of daily living score and updrs part iii motor skills score for rytary versus placebo at week  or early termination in advancepd study  a trial of  randomized patients with advanced parkinsons disease having off time the results showed treatment with rytary reduced the percentage of off time  to  from baseline versus immediaterelease carbidopalevodopa  to  during waking hours to end of study rytary also increased on time without troublesome dyskinesia during waking hours versus baseline to end of study by  hours less off time was primary related to more on time without troublesome dyskinesia the most common adverse reactions with rytary in the apexpd trial in at least  of patients and more frequently than in placebo were nausea dizziness headache insomnia abnormal dreams dry mouth dyskinesia anxiety constipation vomiting and orthostatic hypotension the most common adverse reactions with rytary in the advancepd trial in at least  of patients and more frequently than an oral immediaterelease carbidopalevodopa were nausea and headache about parkinsons disease parkinsons disease is a chronic neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting approximately one million people in the us with  new cases diagnosed each year in the us alone there is currently no known cure for parkinsons about rytary important safety information rytary is contraindicated in patients who are currently taking or have recently within  weeks taken a nonselective monoamine oxidase mao inhibitor eg phenelzine and tranylcypromine hypertension can occur if these drugs are used concurrently patients treated with levodopa a component of rytary have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living including the operation of motor vehicles which sometimes resulted in accidents although many of these patients reported somnolence while on levodopa some perceived that they had no warning signs sleep attack such as excessive drowsiness and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event some of these events have been reported more than  year after initiation of treatment before initiating treatment with rytary advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with rytary such as concomitant sedating medications or the presence of a sleep disorder prescribers should consider discontinuing rytary in patients who report significant daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation eg conversations eating etc if a decision is made to continue rytary patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if the patients become somnolent a symptom complex that resembles neuroleptic malignant syndrome characterized by elevated temperature muscular rigidity altered consciousness and autonomic instability with no other obvious etiology has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction withdrawal of or changes in dopaminergic therapy avoid sudden discontinuation or rapid dose reduction in patients taking rytary if the decision is made to discontinue rytary the dose should be tapered to reduce the risk of hyperpyrexia and confusion cardiovascular ischemic events have occurred in patients taking rytary in patients with a history of myocardial infarction who have residual atrial nodal or ventricular arrhythmias cardiac function should be monitored in an intensive cardiac care facility during the period of initial dosage adjustment there is an increased risk for hallucinations and psychosis in patients taking rytary hallucinations present shortly after the initiation of therapy and may be responsive to dose reduction in levodopa hallucinations may be accompanied by confusion and sleep disorder insomnia and excessive dreaming abnormal thinking and behavior may present with one or more symptoms including paranoid ideation delusions hallucinations confusion psychoticlike behavior disorientation aggressive behavior agitation and delirium  because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis patients with a major psychotic disorder should not be treated with rytary in addition medications that antagonize the effects of dopamine used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of parkinsons disease and may decrease the effectiveness of rytary case reports suggest that patients can experience intense urges to gamble increased sexual urges intense urges to spend money binge eating andor other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications including rytary that increase central dopaminergic tone and that are generally used for the treatment of parkinsons disease in some cases although not all these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was discontinued because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges sexual urges uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with rytary consider a dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking rytary rytary can cause dyskinesias that may require a dosage reduction of rytary or other medications used for the treatment of parkinsons disease  treatment with rytary may increase the possibility of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with a history of peptic ulcer and may cause increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma  rytary should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus  caution should be exercised when rytary is administered to a nursing woman overdosage the acute symptoms of levodopadopa decarboxylase inhibitor overdosage can be expected to arise from dopaminergic overstimulation cardiovascular and cns disturbances drug interactions  monitor patients taking selective maob inhibitors and carbidopalevodopa the combination may be associated with orthostatic hypotension rytary should be coadministered cautiously with dopamine d antagonists metoclopramide isoniazid and iron salts rytary should not be chewed divided or crushed   about impax
