accessories photos always make great additions but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames when lit candles add a romantic relaxing feel and coffee table books about travel home design fashion or photography make for great conversation starters house decorations can cozy up your floorwhile floor space may be limited there’s always room for a wellplaced area rug or two these are a great way to add texture color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started then pair your pattern with a textured berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence add some vibrancy to neutralcolored furniture one of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display swap out throw pillows and blankets to

rules when it comes to the correct rug size but most designers today will encourage you to break those rules its your call but keep in mind what is both functional and aesthetically pleasing look to your furniture to determine the size in a living room rugs should offer plenty of coverage from one sofa to the next after all if there are too many gaps its small size will be easy to notice you should also keep in mind architectural cues one near the front door is often just large enough to slightly surpass the door frame while a narrow hallway requires equally narrow runner rugs in the end your space and furniture will dictate the size more than anything elsewhat material should my rug be made ofsome rugs are more durable than others so before you pick out your favorite pattern determine how much traffic the space is going to get for a hightraffic entryway jute rugs and sisal rugs can be good choices since they tend to hide dirt and show less wear and tear cotton synthetic and wool rugs work well for larger areas in bedrooms and living rooms — they come in fun colors and offer more cushion if you love luxury more than practicality you can always opt for silk or fur options regardless be sure you keep your family in mind as well silk and fur dont mesh well with little kids or family pets and dont forget rug pads — these handy additions help you avoid creating an accidental slip and slidewhat style accent rug should i look forbecause its one of the largest decorative pieces in your space it should accurately reflect your style for those with traditional tastes persian rugs and floral patterns are goto options while geometric patterns and bright colors are trendier and more contemporary in the end its great to mix and match rugs and decor but avoid

are best for area rugsit’s recommended that you don’t skimp when it comes to purchasing a new area rug as high quality natural fibers like wool and silk are best but tend to be more expensive other natural fibers such as jute grass and sisal can cost less but won’t wear as well another quality to look for is how easy it is to clean the materials especially if you have children or pets if you’re having trouble gauging how much you’re comfortable spending on a new area rug take a look at how much other pieces of furniture in the room cost and search for area rugs that are priced similarly what size area rug should i purchaseas a general rule it’s recommended you choose area rugs that are two feet shorter than the shortest wall in the room where they’ll be placed for example if your bedroom is  feet by  feet limit your search to bedroom rugs that are no more than nine feet long of course this rule may not work in certain circumstances like dining room rugs or living room rugs for a dining room look for an area rug that extends at least  inches past the edge of your dining table so that your dining chairs will fit on top a living room rug should help designate conversation areas and should be big enough so that the front third of each piece of furniture sits on top of the rug if your living room or den is large enough to hold more than one conversation area you might consider
