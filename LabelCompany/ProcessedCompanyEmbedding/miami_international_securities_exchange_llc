the provisions of section b of the securities exchange act of  “act”  and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on march   miami international securities exchange llc “miax” or “exchange” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” a proposed rule change as described in items i ii and iii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange is filing a proposal to amend the miax options fee schedule the “fee schedule” to establish fees applicable to distributors described below of the top of miax “tom” market data product a direct data feed that features the exchanges best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information on the miax system while changes to the fee schedule pursuant to this proposal are effective upon filing the exchange has designated these changes to be operative on april   the text of the proposed rule change is provided in exhibit  the text of the proposed rule change is also available on the exchanges web site at httpwwwmiaxoptionscom​filter​wotitle​rule​filing at miaxs principal office and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant aspects of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish fees for distributors of tom tom provides distributors with a direct data feed that includes the exchanges best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information based on displayable order and quoting interest on the exchange the tom data feed includes data that is identical to the data sent to the processor for the options price regulatory authority “opra” the tom and opra data leave the miax system at the same time as required under section ciiib of the limited liability company agreement of the options price reporting authority llc the “opra plan” which prohibits the dissemination of proprietary information on any more timely basis than the same information is furnished to the opra system for inclusion in opras consolidated dissemination of options information start printed page  monthly fees for tom the exchange proposes to charge monthly fees to distributors of the tom market data product the fee schedule will reflect that a “distributor” of tom data is any entity that receives a feed of tom data either directly from miax or indirectly through another entity and then distributes it either internally within that entity or externally outside that entity and that all distributors would be required to execute a miax distributor agreement the monthly distributor fee charged will depend on whether the distributor is an “internal distributor” or an “external distributor” as defined below internal distributor an internal distributor is an organization that subscribes to the exchange for the use of tom and is permitted by agreement with the exchange to provide tom data to internal users ie users within their own organization internal distributors would be charged a monthly fee of  per organization external distributor an external distributor is an organization that subscribes to the exchange for the use of tom and is permitted by agreement with the exchange to provide tom data to both internal users and to external users ie users outside of their own organization external distributors will be charged a monthly fee of  per organization market data fees for tom will be reduced for new distributors for the first month during which they subscribe to tom based on the number of trading days that have been held during such month as of the date on which they subscribe such new distributors will be assessed a prorata percentage of the fees described above which is the percentage of the number of trading days remaining in the affected calendar month as of the date on which they begin to receive the tom feed divided by the total number of trading days in the affected calendar month in addition to miaxs best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information distributors that subscribe to tom will also receive opening imbalance condition information opening routing information expanded quote range  information as provided in miax rule f posthalt notification as provided in miax rule d and liquidity refresh condition information as provided in miax rule ciiia this additional information the “administrative information” is included in the tom feed as secondary information the administrative information is also currently available to miax market makers via connectivity with the miax express interface “mei” for which they are assessed connectivity fees in order to accommodate those who wish to receive the administrative information but who do not wish to subscribe to the tom product the exchange submitted a separate proposed rule change concurrently with the instant proposed rule change to establish a new category of miax participant an administrative information subscriber “ais” to make the administrative information available to ais via ais port connectivity with miax and to establish testing connectivity and ais port fees for such participants who wish only to receive the administrative information via connectivity with the miax system  statutory basis miax believes that its proposal to amend its fee schedule is consistent with the provisions of section  of the act in general and with section b of the act in particular in that it provides an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among distributors of tom because all distributors in each of the respective category of distributor ie internal and external will be assessed the same fees as other distributors in their category in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history if the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to brokerdealers at all it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well in july  congress adopted hr  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  “doddfrank act” which amended section  of the act among other things section  of the doddfrank act amended paragraph a of section b of the act by inserting the phrase “on any person whether or not the person is a member of the selfregulatory organization” after “due fee or other charge imposed by the selfregulatory organization” as a result all sro rule proposals establishing or changing dues fees or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues fees or other charges are imposed on members of the sro nonmembers or both section  further amended paragraph c of section b of the act to read in pertinent part “at any time within the day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph  of section b the commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the selfregulatory organization made thereby if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title if the commission start printed page takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph b of section b to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved” the exchange believes that these amendments to section  of the act reflect congresss intent to allow the commission to rely upon the forces of competition to ensure that fees for market data are reasonable and equitably allocated although section b had formerly authorized immediate effectiveness for a “due fee or other charge imposed by the selfregulatory organization” the commission adopted a policy and subsequently a rule stating that fees for data and other products available to persons that are not members of the selfregulatory organization must be approved by the commission after first being published for comment at the time the commission supported the adoption of the policy and the rule by pointing out that unlike members whose representation in selfregulatory organization governance was mandated by the act nonmembers should be given the opportunity to comment on fees before being required to pay them and that the commission should specifically approve all such fees miax believes that the amendment to section  reflects congresss conclusion that the evolution of selfregulatory organization governance and competitive market structure have rendered the commissions prior policy on nonmember fees obsolete specifically many exchanges have evolved from memberowned notforprofit corporations into forprofit investorowned corporations or subsidiaries of investorowned corporations accordingly exchanges no longer have narrow incentives to manage their affairs for the exclusive benefit of their members but rather have incentives to maximize the appeal of their products to all customers whether members or nonmembers so as to broaden distribution and grow revenues moreover the exchange believes that the change also reflects an endorsement of the commissions determinations that reliance on competitive markets is an appropriate means to ensure equitable and reasonable prices simply put the change reflects a presumption that all fee changes should be permitted to take effect immediately since the level of all fees are constrained by competitive forces the exchange therefore believes that the fees for tom are properly assessed on nonmember distributors the decision of the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in netcoaliton v sec no  dc cir  although reviewing a commission decision made prior to the effective date of the doddfrank act upheld the commissions reliance upon competitive markets to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for market data in fact the legislative history indicates that the congress intended that the market system “evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed” and that the sec wield its regulatory power “in those situations where competition may not be sufficient” such as in the creation of a “consolidated transactional reporting system”  the courts conclusions about congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the doddfrank act amendments which create a presumption that exchange fees including market data fees may take effect immediately without prior commission approval and that the commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the act miax believes that the proposed fee is fair and equitable in accordance with section b of the act and not unreasonably discriminatory in accordance with section b of the act as described above the proposed fee is based on pricing that exists in the fee schedules of other exchanges moreover the decision as to whether or not to subscribe to tom is entirely optional to all parties potential subscribers are not required to purchase the tom market data feed and miax is not required to make the tom market data feed available subscribers can discontinue their use at any time and for any reason including due to their assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged the allocation of fees among subscribers is fair and reasonable because if the market deems the proposed fees to be unfair or inequitable firms can diminish or discontinue their use of this data b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act notwithstanding its determination that the commission may rely upon competition to establish fair and equitably allocated fees for market data the netcoalition court found that the commission had not in that case compiled a record that adequately supported its conclusion that the market for the data at issue in the case was competitive miax believes that a record may readily be established to demonstrate the competitive nature of the market in question there is intense competition between trading platforms that provide transaction execution and routing services and proprietary data products transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service in fact market data and trade execution are a representative example of joint products with joint costs the decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platform where the order can be posted including the execution fees data quality and price and distribution of its data products without the prospect of a taking order seeing and reacting to a posted order on a particular platform the posting of the order would accomplish little without trade executions exchange data products cannot exist data products are valuable to many end subscribers only insofar as they provide information that end subscribers expect will assist them or their customers in making trading decisions the costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure but also the costs of designing maintaining and operating the exchanges transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence the total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs moreover an exchanges customers view the costs of transaction executions and of data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange a brokerdealer will direct orders to a particular exchange only if the expected revenues from executing trades on the exchange exceed net transaction execution costs and the cost of data that the brokerdealer chooses to buy to support its trading decisions or those of its customers the choice of data products is in turn a product of the value of the products in making profitable trading decisions if the cost of the product exceeds its expected start printed page value the brokerdealer will choose not to buy it moreover as a brokerdealer chooses to direct fewer orders to a particular exchange the value of the product to the brokerdealer decreases for two reasons first the product will contain less information because executions of the brokerdealers orders will not be reflected in it second and perhaps more important the product will be less valuable to that brokerdealer because it does not provide information about the venue to which it is directing its orders data from the competing venue to which the brokerdealer is directing orders will become correspondingly more valuable thus a supercompetitive increase in the fees charged for either transactions or data has the potential to impair revenues from both products “no one disputes that competition for order flow is fierce”  however the existence of fierce competition for order flow implies a high degree of price sensitivity on the part of brokerdealers with order flow since they may readily reduce costs by directing orders toward the lowestcost trading venues a brokerdealer that shifted its order flow from one platform to another in response to order execution price differentials would both reduce the value of that platforms market data and reduce its own need to consume data from the disfavored platform similarly if a platform increases its market data fees the change will affect the overall cost of doing business with the platform and affected brokerdealers will assess whether they can lower their trading costs by directing orders elsewhere and thereby lessening the need for the more expensive data analyzing the cost of market data distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data thus because it is impossible to create data without a fast technologically robust and wellregulated execution system system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of market data it would be equally misleading however to attribute all of the exchanges costs to the market data portion of an exchanges joint product rather all of the exchanges costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow executing andor routing orders and generating and selling data about market activity the total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return each platform earns from the sale of its joint products but different platforms may choose from a range of possible and equally reasonable pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs for example some platforms may choose to pay rebates to attract orders charge relatively low prices for market information or provide information free of charge and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates or no rebates to attract orders setting relatively high prices for market information and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity in this environment there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering this would be akin to strictly regulating the price that an automobile manufacturer can charge for car sound systems despite the existence of a highly competitive market for cars and the availability of aftermarket alternatives to the manufacturersupplied system the market for market data products is competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings trades and market data itself providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to produce and distribute their own market data this proprietary data is produced by each individual exchange as well as other entities in a vigorously competitive market brokerdealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow including eleven existing options markets each sro market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions competitive markets for order flow executions and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products the large number of sros that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products each sro is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products and many in addition to miax currently do including nasdaq cboe ise nyse amex and nysearca additionally order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple brokerdealers production of proprietary data products the potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless market data vendors provide another form of price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to end subscribers vendors impose price restraints based upon their business models for example vendors such as bloomberg and thomson reuters that assess a surcharge on data they sell may refuse to offer proprietary products that end subscribers will not purchase in sufficient numbers internet portals such as google impose a discipline by providing only data that will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue retail brokerdealers such as schwab and fidelity offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue although the business models may differ these vendors pricing discipline is the same they can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value miax and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully in addition to the competition and price discipline described above the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid inexpensive and profitable the history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers archipelago bats trading and direct edge regulation nms by deregulating the market for proprietary data has increased the contestability of that market while brokerdealers have previously published their proprietary data individually regulation nms encourages market data vendors and brokerdealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale including bloomberg and thomson reuters the court in netcoalition concluded that the commission had failed to demonstrate that the market for market data was competitive based on the reasoning of the commissions netcoalition order because in the courts view the commission had not adequately demonstrated that the proprietary data at issue in the case is start printed page used to attract order flow miax believes however that evidence not then before the court clearly demonstrates that availability of data attracts order flow due to competition among platforms miax intends to improve its platform data offerings on a continuing basis and to respond promptly to customers data needs the intensity of competition for proprietary information is significant and miax believes that this proposal itself clearly evidences such competition miax is offering tom in order to keep pace with changes in the industry and evolving customer needs it is entirely optional and is geared towards attracting new member applicants and customers miax competitors continue to create new market data products and innovative pricing in this space miax expects to see firms challenge its pricing on the basis of miaxs explicit fees being higher than the zeropriced fees from other competitors such as bats in all cases miax expects firms to make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume on the basis of the total cost of interacting with miax or other exchanges of course the explicit data fees are only one factor in a total platform analysis some competitors have lower transactions fees and higher data fees and others are vice versa the market for this proprietary information is highly competitive and continually evolves as products develop and change the exchange notes that the tom market data and fees will compete with similar products offered by other markets such as nasdaq omx phlx llc “phlx” and the international stock exchange llc “ise” for example phlx and ise offer market data products that are similar to tom data feeds that show the top of the market entitled top of phlx options “topo” and the ise top quote feed c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members

selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant aspects of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the purpose of the proposed rule change is to establish the tom market data product tom provides a direct data feed that includes the exchanges best bid and offer with aggregate size based on displayable order and quoting interest on the exchange the tom data feed includes data that is identical to the data sent to the processor for the options price reporting authority “opra” the tom and opra data leave the miax system at the same time as required under section ciiib of the limited liability company agreement of the options price reporting authority llc the “opra plan” which prohibits the dissemination of proprietary information on any more timely basis than the same information is furnished to the opra system for inclusion in opras consolidated dissemination of options information in addition to miaxs best bid and offer with aggregate size and last sale information subscribers to tom will also receive opening imbalance condition information opening and intraday routing information expanded start printed page quote range  information posthalt notification  and liquidity refresh  condition information miax market makers receive this additional information by way of connectivity with the miax express interface “mei”  those who are not miax market makers must subscribe to tom in order to receive the additional information the exchange expects to file with the commission to assess fees applicable to tom such fees will not be assessed until the first full calendar month during which miax lists and trades options overlying at least  underlying securities once miax begins listing and trading options overlying at least  underlying securities and subject to filing with the commission miax will assess market data fees applicable to tom  statutory basis miax believes that its proposed rule change is consistent with section b  of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b  of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers the tom product is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade by providing all subscribers with top of market data that should enable them to make informed decisions on trading in miax options by using the tom data to assess current market conditions that directly affect such decisions the market data provided by tom removes impediments to and is designed to further perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system by making the miax market more transparent and accessible to market participants making routing decisions concerning their options orders the tom market data product is also designed to protect investors and the public interest by providing data to subscribers that is already currently available on other exchanges  and will enable miax to compete with such other exchanges thereby offering market participants with additional data in order to seek the market center with the best price and the most liquidity on which to execute their transactions all to the benefit of investors and the public interest and to the marketplace as a whole b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act on the contrary the exchange believes that the tom market data product will enhance competition in the us options markets by providing similar data to that which is currently provided on another options exchange c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others written comments were neither solicited or received iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action because the foregoing proposed rule change does not i significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest ii impose any significant burden on competition and iii become operative for  days after the date of the filing or such shorter
