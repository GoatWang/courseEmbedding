americans in the country did you know the final section of martin luther king jr’s eloquent and iconic “i have a dream” speech is believed to have been largely improviseda gifted student king attended segregated public schools and at the age of  was admitted to morehouse college the alma mater of both his father and maternal grandfather where he studied medicine and law although he had not intended to follow in his father’s footsteps by joining the ministry he changed his mind under the mentorship of morehouse’s president dr benjamin mays an influential theologian and outspoken advocate for racial equality after graduating in  king entered crozer theological seminary in pennsylvania where he earned a bachelor of divinity degree won a prestigious fellowship and was elected president of his predominantly white senior class king then enrolled in a graduate program at boston university completing his coursework in  and earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later while in

dexter avenue baptist church they had four children yolanda denise king  martin luther king iii born  dexter scott king born  and bernice albertine king born  martin luther king jr and the montgomery bus boycott the king family had been living in montgomery for less than a year when the highly segregated city became the epicenter of the burgeoning struggle for civil rights in america galvanized by the landmark brown v board of education of topeka decision of  on december   rosa parks  secretary of the local national association for the advancement of colored people chapter refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a montgomery bus and was arrested activists coordinated a bus boycott that would continue for  days placing a severe economic strain on the public transit system and downtown business owners they chose martin luther king jr as the protest’s leader and official spokesman by the time the supreme court ruled segregated seating on public buses unconstitutional in november  king heavily influenced by mahatma gandhi  and the activist bayard rustin  had entered the national spotlight as an inspirational proponent of organized nonviolent resistance he had also become a target for white supremacists who firebombed his family home that january emboldened by the boycott’s success in  he and other civil rights activists–most of them fellow ministers–founded the southern christian leadership conference sclc a group committed to achieving full equality for african americans through nonviolence its motto was “not one hair of one head of one person should be harmed” he would remain at the helm of this influential organization until his death king and the southern christian leadership conference in his role as sclc president martin luther king jr traveled across the country and around the world giving lectures on nonviolent protest and civil rights as well as meeting with religious figures activists and political leaders during a monthlong trip to india in  he had the opportunity to meet family members and followers of gandhi the man he described in his autobiography as “the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social change” king also authored several books and articles during this time in  king and his family moved to atlanta his native city where he joined his father as copastor of the ebenezer baptist church this new position did not stop king and his sclc colleagues from becoming key players in many of the most significant civil rights battles of the s their philosophy of nonviolence was put to a particularly severe test during the birmingham campaign of  in which activists used a boycott sitins and marches to protest segregation unfair hiring practices and other injustices in one of america’s most racially divided cities arrested for his involvement on april  king penned the civil rights manifesto known as the “letter from birmingham jail” an eloquent defense of civil disobedience addressed to a group of white clergymen who had criticized his tactics king marches for freedom later that year martin luther king jr worked with a number of civil rights and religious groups to organize the march on washington for jobs and freedom a peaceful political rally designed to shed light on the injustices african americans continued to face across the country held on august  and attended by some  to  participants the event is widely regarded as a watershed moment in the history of the american civil rights movement and a factor in the passage of the civil rights act of  the march culminated in king’s most famous address known as the “i have a dream” speech a spirited call for peace and equality that many consider a masterpiece of rhetoric standing on the steps of the lincoln memorial–a monument to the president who a century earlier had brought down the institution of slavery in the united states—he shared his vision of a future in which “this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed ‘we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal” the speech and march cemented king’s reputation at home and abroad later that year he was named man of the year by time magazine and in  became the youngest person ever awarded the nobel peace prize in the spring of  king’s elevated profile drew international attention to the violence that erupted between white segregationists and peaceful demonstrators in selma alabama where the sclc and student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc had organized a voter registration campaign captured on television the brutal scene outraged many americans and inspired supporters from across the country to gather in selma and take part in a march to montgomery led by king and supported by president lyndon johnson  who sent in federal troops to keep the peace that august congress passed the voting rights act which guaranteed the right to vote–first awarded by the th amendment–to all african americans martin luther king jr’s final years and assassination the events in selma deepened a growing rift between martin luther king jr and young radicals who repudiated his nonviolent methods and commitment to working within the established political framework as more militant black leaders such as stokely carmichael  rose to prominence king broadened the scope of his activism to address issues such as the vietnam war and poverty among americans of all races in  king and the sclc embarked on an ambitious program known as the poor people’s campaign which was to include a massive march on the capital on the evening of april   king was fatally shot while standing on the balcony of a motel in memphis where he had traveled to support a sanitation workers’ strike in the wake of his death a wave of riots swept major cities across the country while president johnson declared a national day of mourning james earl ray  an escaped convict and known racist pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to  years in prison he later recanted his confession and gained some unlikely advocates including members of the king family before his death in  after years of campaigning by activists members of

abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair”“any law that uplifts human personality is just any law that degrades human personality is unjust”“the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges”“let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred”“darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that”“the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy the true neighbor will risk his position his prestige and even his life for the welfare of others”“we must all learn to live together as brothers or we will all perish together as fools”“forgiveness is not an occasional act it is a permanent attitude”“i have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character”“the function of education therefore is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically but education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society the most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason but with no morals”“ive seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land”“power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love”“a man who wont die for something is not fit to live”“at the center of nonviolence stands the principle of love”“right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil

himselfgallery images young martin had an older sister willie christine and a younger brother alfred daniel williams king the king children grew up in a secure and loving environment martin sr was more the disciplinarian while his wifes gentleness easily balanced out the fathers more strict hand though they undoubtedly tried martin jr’s parents couldn’t shield him completely from racism martin luther king sr fought against racial prejudice not just because his race suffered but because he considered racism and segregation to be an affront to gods will he strongly discouraged any sense of class superiority in his children which left a lasting impression on martin jr growing up in atlanta georgia martin luther king jr entered public school at age  in may  he was baptized but the event made little impression on him in may  martin was  years old when is grandmother jennie died of a heart attack the event was traumatic for martin more so because he was out watching a parade against his parents wishes when she died distraught at the news young martin jumped from a second story window at the family home allegedly attempting suicide king attended booker t washington high school where he was said to be a precocious student he skipped both the ninth and eleventh grades and entered morehouse college in atlanta at age  in  he was a popular student especially with his female classmates but an unmotivated student who floated though his first two years although his family was deeply involved in the church and worship young martin questioned religion in general and felt uncomfortable with overly emotional displays of religious worship this discomfort continued through much of his adolescence initially leading him to decide against entering the ministry much to his fathers dismay but in his junior year martin took a bible class renewed his faith and began to envision a career in the ministry in the fall of his senior year he told his father of his decisioneducation and spiritual growthin  martin luther king jr earned a sociology degree from morehouse college and attended the liberal crozer theological seminary in chester pennsylvania he thrived in all his studies and was valedictorian of his class in  and elected student body president he also earned a fellowship for graduate study but martin also rebelled against his father’s more conservative influence by drinking beer and playing pool while at college he became involved with a white woman and went through a difficult time before he could break off the affair during his last year in seminary martin luther king jr came under the guidance of morehouse college president benjamin e mays who influenced king’s spiritual development mays was an outspoken advocate for racial equality and encouraged king to view christianity as a potential force for social change after being accepted at several colleges for his doctoral study including yale and edinburgh in scotland king enrolled at boston university during the work on his doctorate martin luther king jr met coretta scott an aspiring singer and musician at the new england conservatory school in boston they were married in june  and had four children yolanda martin luther king iii dexter scott and bernice in  while still working on his dissertation king became pastor of the dexter avenue baptist church of montgomery alabama he completed his phd and earned his degree in  king was only  years oldmontgomery bus boycotton march   a yearold girl refused to give up her seat to a white man on a montgomery city bus in violation of local law claudette colvin was arrested and taken to jail at first the local chapter of the naacp felt they had an excellent test case to challenge montgomerys segregated bus policy but then it was revealed that she was pregnant and civil rights leaders feared this would scandalize the deeply religious black community and make colvin and thus the groups efforts less credible in the eyes of sympathetic whites on december   they got another chance to make their case that evening yearold rosa parks boarded the cleveland avenue bus to go home after an exhausting day at work she sat in the first row of the colored section in the middle of the bus as the bus traveled its route all the seats in the white section filled up then several more white passengers boarded the bus the bus driver noted that there were several white men standing and demanded that parks and several other african americans give up their seats three other african american passengers reluctantly gave up their places but parks remained seated the driver asked her again to give up her seat and again she refused parks was arrested and booked for violating the montgomery city code at her trial a week later in a minute hearing parks was found guilty and fined  and assessed  court fee on the night that rosa parks was arrested ed nixon head of the local naacp chapter met with martin luther king jr and other local civil rights leaders to plan a citywide bus boycott king was elected to lead the boycott because he was young welltrained with solid family connections and had professional standing but he was also new to the community and had few enemies so it was felt he would have strong credibility with the black community in his first speech as the groups president king declared we have no alternative but to protest for many years we have shown an amazing patience we have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated but we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and justice martin luther king jrs skillful rhetoric put a new energy into the civil rights struggle in alabama the bus boycott involved  days of walking to work harassment violence and intimidation for the montgomerys africanamerican community both kings and ed nixons homes were attacked but the africanamerican community also took legal action against the city ordinance arguing that it was unconstitutional based on the supreme courts separate is never equal decision in brown v board of education after being defeated in several lower court rulings and suffering large financial losses the city of montgomery lifted the law mandating segregated public transportationthe southern christian leadership conferenceflush with victory africanamerican civil rights leaders recognized the need for a national organization to help coordinate their efforts in january  martin luther king jr ralph abernathy and  ministers and civil rights activists founded the southern christian leadership conference to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches they would help conduct nonviolent protests to promote civil rights reform kings participation in the organization gave him a base of operation throughout the south as well as a national platform the organization felt the best place to start to give african americans a voice was to enfranchise them in the voting process in february  the sclc sponsored more than  mass meetings in key southern cities to register black voters in the south king met with religious and civil rights leaders and lectured all over the country on racerelated issues in  with the help of the american friends service committee and inspired by gandhis success with nonviolent activism martin luther king visited gandhis birthplace in india the trip affected him in a deeply profound way increasing his commitment to americas civil rights struggle africanamerican civil rights activist bayard rustin who had studied gandhis teachings became one of kings associates and counseled him to dedicate himself to the principles of nonviolence rustin served as kings mentor and advisor throughout his early activism and was the main organizer of the  march on washington but rustin was also a controversial figure at the time being a homosexual with alleged ties to the communist party usa though his counsel was invaluable to king many of his other supporters urged him to distance himself from rustin in february  a group of africanamerican students began what became known as the sitin movement in greensboro north carolina the students would sit at racially segregated lunch counters in the citys stores when asked to leave or sit in the colored section they just remained seated subjecting themselves to verbal and sometimes physical abuse the movement quickly gained traction in several other cities in april  the sclc held a conference at shaw university in raleigh north carolina with local sitin leaders martin luther king jr encouraged students to continue to use nonviolent methods during their protests out of this meeting the student nonviolent coordinating committee formed and for a time worked closely with the sclc by august of  the sitins had been successful in ending segregation at lunch counters in  southern cities by  martin luther king jr was gaining national notoriety he returned to atlanta to become copastor with his father at ebenezer baptist church but also continued his civil rights efforts on october   king and  students entered a local department store and requested lunchcounter service but were denied when they refused to leave the counter area king and  others were arrested realizing the incident would hurt the citys reputation atlantas mayor negotiated a truce and charges were eventually dropped but soon after king was imprisoned for violating his probation on a traffic conviction the news of his imprisonment entered the  presidential campaign when candidate john f kennedy made a phone call to coretta scott king kennedy expressed his concern for kings harsh treatment for the traffic ticket and political pressure was quickly set in motion king was soon releasedi have a dreamin the spring of  martin luther king jr organized a demonstration in downtown birmingham
