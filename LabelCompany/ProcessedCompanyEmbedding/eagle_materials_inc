results the company set a record for revenue thanks in part to its recent acquisition of the fairborn cement plant from cemex nyse cx that said all its segments performed well during the quarter due to improving economic trendseagle materials results the raw numbersmetricfiscal q fiscal q yearoveryear changerevenue million millionnet earnings million millioneps data source eagle materials incimage source getty imageswhat happened with eagle materials this quarter the cemex deal took results up another levelcement revenues surged  versus last years fiscal first quarter to  million while operating earnings rose  to  million due to a  increase in prices and  higher volumes that said the cemex deal drove the bulk of those gains since prices and volumes would have only risen  and  respectively without that acquisitionconcrete and aggregate sales jumped  to  million while operating profit came in at  million which was  higher than the yearago period thanks to improving volumes and pricesgypsum wallboard and paperboard sales rose  to  million thanks to rising gypsum wallboard sales prices and volumes as well as higher paperboard sales prices that said operating earnings slid

companys fiscal firstquarter conference call ceo dave powers offered his comments on the business conditions that drove its results he saidlet me begin with a few observations about some of the things that stand out to me about the quarter first the opportunity to sell products across all of our businesses cement wallboard profits and concrete and aggregates continues to improve and were taking advantages of these trends the underlying drivers of our businesses are almost universally toggled in the up position and longerterm risk currently skew to the upside singlefamily housing starts for example continue to improve and have substantial room for growth household formation trends combined with an economic environment of low unemployment healthy job growth and low interest rates are a powerful combination most areas of the us are doing well especially in the markets that we operate infrastructure investment is growing and could grow even more in the years to come  as powers notes business is booming right now thanks to healthy economic growth the company doesnt expect those trends to slow anytime soon given that theres ample room for continued housing growth and the expectation that infrastructure investment will pick up as a result of president trumps desire to rebuild the countrys infrastructurelooking forward given those trends powers provided the following forecast  going forward we would expect our cement volumes to grow at about a  to  rate on wallboard we expect volumes to grow in the midsingle digits and our proppant volumes to grow around threefold this year albeit from a relatively low comparable base to the last point weve continued to take advantage of the current general low on oilfield activity broadly across america to build our capabilities in the proppants business im pleased to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire wildcat minerals a wellestablished frack sand distribution companypowers sees healthy growth ahead for all of eagles segments especially in its frack sand business where it recently took advantage of improving market conditions to bolster its position so it can capture the

this quarter the cemex deal took results up another levelcement revenues surged  versus last years fiscal first quarter to  million while operating earnings rose  to  million due to a  increase in prices and  higher volumes that said the cemex deal drove the bulk of those gains since prices and volumes would have only risen  and  respectively without that acquisitionconcrete and aggregate sales jumped  to  million while operating profit came in at  million which was  higher than the yearago period thanks to improving volumes and pricesgypsum wallboard and paperboard sales rose  to  million

offered his comments on the business conditions that drove its results he saidlet me begin with a few observations about some of the things that stand out to me about the quarter first the opportunity to sell products across all of our businesses cement wallboard profits and concrete and aggregates continues to improve and were taking advantages of these trends the underlying drivers of our businesses are almost universally toggled in the up position and longerterm risk currently skew to the upside singlefamily housing starts for example continue to improve and have substantial room for growth household formation trends combined with an economic environment of low unemployment healthy job growth and low interest rates are a powerful combination most areas of the us are doing well especially in the markets that we operate infrastructure investment is growing and could grow even more in the years to come  as powers notes business is booming right now thanks to healthy economic growth the company doesnt expect those trends to slow anytime soon given that theres ample room for continued housing growth and the expectation that infrastructure investment will pick up as a result of president trumps desire to rebuild the countrys infrastructurelooking forward given those trends powers provided the following forecast  going forward we would expect our cement volumes to grow at about a  to  rate on wallboard we expect volumes to grow in the midsingle digits and our proppant volumes to grow around threefold this year albeit from a relatively low comparable base to the last point weve continued to take advantage of the current general low on oilfield activity broadly across america to build our capabilities in the proppants business im pleased to announce that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire wildcat minerals a wellestablished frack sand distribution companypowers sees healthy growth ahead for all of eagles segments especially in its frack sand
