innovation and customer collaboration molded parts we work closely with our customers to understand application requirements and optimize part design to improve performance and manufacturability molds are designed to support high output low scrap and maintenance requirements our inhouse toolmakers design and build secondary tooling and maintain production molds including the following injection molding the presses used for injection molding are horizontally operated with a unique material delivery system the thermoset compound is fed and injected with a high speed reciprocating screw or a plunger system that reduces glass degradation for better part strength compression molding this molding process utilizes a prestaged charge of material that is created by manually or automatically cutting stacking arranging and weighing the individual smc or tmc pieces this charge is either manually or automatically loaded into the open mold once the charge is placed the mold is closed with a fast closing speed followed by a controlled final closure speed once the thermoset compound begins to flow as the compound flows in the mold it reaches a telescoping shear edge zone at the perimeter of the cavity that enables air to escape resin transfer molding perfect for medium volume runs or highly detailed parts the resin transfer process offers key advantages over open molding because it creates smooth surfaces on both sides of a part and it allows ribs and bosses to be molded in resin transfer molding offers lower cost tooling than compression molding although the surface quality approaches that of compression parts resin transfer is also useful for prototyping compression molded parts since mechanical properties are similar open  hand layup open molding parts are appropriate for large parts with low to medium volumes and one finished surface the process is capable of molding in undercuts and hardware such as brackets resin and gelcoats can be color matched to eliminate the need for secondary finishing hand layup parts are also used for functional prototyping open molding utilizes low cost polyester molds built by our inhouse tooling department pultrusion pultrusion is a manufacturing process used to produce continuous lengths of  composite materials with constant crosssections the process involves pulling raw materials liquid resin mixtures through a heated steel forming die using a continuous pulling device machining where precision machining is required we can meet the tightest tolerances – and we have the capacity to meet demanding volume and scheduling requirements as well highlycomplex parts and those with extraordinary tolerances can be produced in our threeaxis and fiveaxis cnc machining centers finishing finishing is performed with a

offer a variety of paint finishes including smooth blemishfree painted and silkscreened parts high gloss painting as well as texture painting which offers a uniform appearance from lot to lot – and
