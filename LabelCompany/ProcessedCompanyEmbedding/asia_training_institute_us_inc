currently there is no dominant industry leader we plan to provide specialized best in market products through our distribution channels the company expects to face further competition from new market entrants and possible alliances among competitors in the future as the convergence of information processing and telecommunications continues many of the companys current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than the company as a result they may be better able to respond or adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements or to devote greater resources to the development marketing and sales of their services than the company there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in addition the company will be faced with numerous competitors both strategic and financial in attempting to obtain competitive products many actual and potential competitors we believe are part of much larger companies with substantially greater financial marketing and other resources than the company and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively against any of its future competitors company description wewearables plans to market and distribute the next generation of wearable health and wellness devices the “wearables” mainly consists of
