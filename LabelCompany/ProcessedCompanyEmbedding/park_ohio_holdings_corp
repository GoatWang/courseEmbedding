both funded by our operating cash flows in the  period we do not have offbalance sheet arrangements financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons liquidity our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital capital expenditures and acquisitions our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations funds available from existing bank credit arrangements and the sale of our debt securities our existing financial resources working capital and available bank borrowing arrangements and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months including but not limited to our ability to maintain current operations and fund capital expenditure requirements service our debt pay dividends pursue acquisitions and repurchase shares the company had cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries of  million at march   and  million at december   for each of our foreign subsidiaries we make a determination regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance if any available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the foreign subsidiaries operational activities and table of contents or future foreign investments at march   management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the united states and it is our current intention to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states although we have no intention to repatriate the approximately  million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of march   if we were to repatriate these

under the amended credit agreement as defined below and to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the companys revolving credit facility under the amended credit agreement as defined below credit agreement the company is a party to a credit and security agreement dated november   as amended and restated the credit agreement with a group of banks under which it may borrow or issue standby letters of credit or commercial letters of credit on july   the company entered into a sixth amendment and restatement of the credit agreement the amended credit agreement which was further amended on october   january   and march   on april   the company further amended the amended credit agreement to increase the credit facility from  million to  million increase the inventory advance rate to  which reduces back to  on a prorata quarterly basis over  months commencing july   increase the canadian sublimit to  million and provide minor pricing adjustments please refer to note   financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion as of march   we had  million outstanding and  million of unused borrowing availability under the revolving

for capital leases capital lease obligations of  million were borrowed under the lease agreement to acquire machinery and equipment as of march   covenants the future availability of bank borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided by the amended credit agreement is based on our ability to meet a debt service ratio covenant which could be materially impacted by negative economic trends failure to meet the debt service ratio covenant could materially impact the availability and interest rate of future borrowings at march   our debt service coverage ratio was  and therefore we were in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio covenant in the revolving credit facility provided by the amended credit agreement the debt service coverage ratio is calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter based on the following ratio  the most recently ended four fiscal quarters of consolidated ebitda as defined in the companys amended credit agreement minus cash taxes paid minus unfunded capital expenditures plus cash tax refunds to table of contents quarters we were also in compliance with the other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility as of march   while we expect to remain in compliance throughout  declines in sales volumes in  could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants additionally to the extent our customers are adversely affected by declines in the economy in general they may be unable to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all which could make our accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base and our ability to borrow under such facility dividends the company paid dividends of  million during the
