company act of  — section a nuveen fund advisors llc june   response of the chief counsels office division of investment management your letter dated june   requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission against nwq investment management company llc �nwq� under section a of the investment company act of  the � act� if under the circumstances described in your letter nwq continued to serve as investment adviser to certain series of the nuveen investment trust and nuveen investment trust ii the �trusts� pursuant to written investment subadvisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such series background you state the following nuveen tradewinds value opportunities fund and nuveen tradewinds global allcap fund the �funds� are series of the trusts the trusts are registered with the commission as openend management investment companies nuveen fund advisors llc �nuveen fund advisors� serves as investment adviser to the funds prior to august   tradewinds global investors llc �tradewinds� served as subadviser to the funds nuveen investments inc �nuveen� owns a controlling interest in nuveen fund advisors tradewinds and nwq in may  nuveen decided to wind up operations at tradewinds due in large part to significant asset outflows that commenced following the departure of tradewinds� president and chief investment officer and persisted thereafter as part of a transition plan at an inperson meeting held in the same month the trusts� board of trustees the �board� approved the termination of each fund�s subadvisory agreement with tradewinds effective as of august   as of the same date the board also appointed nwq as subadviser to the funds pursuant to interim investment subadvisory agreements each an �interim subadvisory agreement� as permitted by rule a under the  act each interim subadvisory agreement was scheduled to terminate no later than december   the �expiration date� thus providing for the longest interim period permitted under the rule also at the may  meeting the board considered various longterm alternatives including liquidation of the funds and determined that the funds� reorganization into nuveen nwq global equity income fund each a �reorganization� was in the best interests of each fund in the event a fund�s reorganization was not approved by shareholders and consummated prior to the expiration date the board also approved the longerterm appointment of nwq as the subadviser to each fund pursuant to a new subadvisory agreement each a �new subadvisory agreement� with a joint proxy statementprospectus dated september   each fund solicited shareholders to approve  its reorganization and  the new subadvisory agreement each a �proposal� after the joint proxy statementprospectus was mailed nuveen fund advisors and the funds actively solicited votes through direct mailings and the use of an experienced and wellrespected proxy solicitor in an effort to achieve a quorum for each fund as of november   an overwhelming majority of the votes received by the funds� shareholders were cast in favor of both proposals nuveen fund advisors however believed that despite all the efforts made there was a high probability that neither fund would receive the number of votes necessary to reach a quorum by the expiration date accordingly as of november   you requested assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action against nwq under section a of the  act if nwq continued to serve as subadviser to the funds for the additional period as described below pursuant to written investment subadvisory agreements that had not been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the funds analysis section a of the  act states in relevant part that it shall be unlawful for a person to serve as an investment adviser of a registered investment company except pursuant to a written contract that among other things has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered investment company section a was adopted to give fund shareholders a voice in approving fund investment advisory contracts and to prevent trafficking in fund advisory contracts rule a under the  act provides a temporary exemption from the shareholder approval requirement in section a where among other circumstances the registered investment company�s board of directors has terminated the previous advisory contract the rule permits a person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company under an interim advisory agreement without the required shareholder approval for a period no greater than  days following the date on which the previous contract terminated subject to the requirements set forth in the rule rule a was designed to prevent registered investment companies from being harmed by losing investment advisory services before shareholders can approve a new investment advisory contract you proposed to have nwq continue to serve as investment subadviser to each fund for an additional period of time following the interim period allowed by rule a but not to exceed the earliest of i the consummation of the reorganization ii shareholder approval of the fund�s new subadvisory agreement or iii  days after the expiration date the �additional period� nuveen fund advisors and the trusts believed that extending the term of the interim subadvisory agreements was in the best interests of the funds and the board approved such extension without such an extension you argue that it may have been necessary to liquidate the funds as conditions to the requested relief the funds and nuveen fund advisors agreed to the following during the additional period nuveen fund advisors and the funds with the assistance of their proxy solicitor would continue their proxy solicitation efforts to seek to reach a quorum nuveen fund advisors would bear all postage printing tabulation and proxy solicitation costs during the additional period nuveen fund advisors would waive the portion of each fund�s investment advisory fee in an amount equal to the amount of the subadvisory fee that would have been payable by nuveen fund advisors to nwq under the original terms of the interim subadvisory agreement other than changes to reflect the relief granted the terms and conditions of the interim subadvisory agreements would remain the same conclusion on the basis of the facts and representations set forth in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission against nwq under section a of the  act for continuing to serve as investment adviser to each fund for the additional period pursuant to written investment subadvisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund this response expresses our views on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusions on the questions presented because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter you should note that any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion jill ehrlich senior counsel  this letter confirms oral noaction relief that the staff provided to deborah bielicke eades esq of vedderprice pc on november    nuveen fund advisors� investment advisory agreements with the funds comply in all respects with section a of the  act including having been approved by a vote of a majority of the funds� outstanding voting securities  nuveen fund advisors and nwq serve as the investment adviser and investment subadviser respectively of nuveen nwq global equity income fund  in particular you state that several factors likely contributed to the failure to reach a quorum including  the level of redemptions since the record date for the shareholder meeting  a higher than typical percentage of each fund�s shares represented by objecting beneficial owners as of the record date and  each fund�s shareholder base was more dispersed than is typical  section a applies to investment advisers as defined
