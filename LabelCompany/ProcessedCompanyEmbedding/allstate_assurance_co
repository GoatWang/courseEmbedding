money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves

money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week

money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather
