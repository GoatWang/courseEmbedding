debord socialism portal communism portal philosophy portal v t e in marxist theory socialism also called lowerstage communism or the socialist mode of production refers to a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that supersede capitalism in the schema of historical materialism the marxist definition of socialism is a mode of production where the sole criterion for production is usevalue and therefore the law of value no longer directs economic activity marxist production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning while distribution of economic output is based on the principle of to each according to his contribution the social relations of socialism are characterized by the working class effectively owning the means of production and the means of their livelihood either through cooperative enterprises or by public ownership or private artisanal tools and selfmanagement so that the social surplus accrues to the working class and society as a whole this view is consistent with and helped to inform early conceptions of socialism where the law of value no longer directs economic activity and thus monetary relations in the form of exchangevalue profit interest and wage labor would not operate and apply to marxist socialism the marxian conception of socialism stands in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism most notably early forms of market socialism based on classical economics such as mutualism and ricardian socialism unlike the marxian conception these conceptions of socialism retained commodity exchange markets for labor and the means of production seeking to perfect the market process the marxist idea of socialism was also heavily opposed to utopian socialism although karl marx and friedrich engels wrote very little on socialism and neglected to provide any details on how it might be organized numerous social scientists and neoclassical economists have used marxs theory as a basis for developing their own models of socialist economic systems the marxist view of socialism served as a point of reference during the socialist calculation debate contents  mode of production  intermediate phases  social relations  role of the state  see also  notes mode of productionedit socialism is a postcommodity economic system meaning that production is carried out to directly produce usevalue to directly satisfy human needs or economic demands as opposed to being produced with a view to generating a profit the stage in which the accumulation of capital was viable and effective is rendered insufficient at the socialist stage of social and economic development leading to a situation where production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a supposedly planned fashion although karl marx and friedrich engels understood planning to involve the input and decisions of the individuals involved at localized levels of production and consumption planning has been interpreted to mean centralized planning by marxistleninists during the th century however there have been other conceptions of economic planning including decentralizedplanning and participatory planning in contrast to capitalism which relies upon the coercive market forces to compel capitalists to produce usevalues as a byproduct of the pursuit of profit socialist production is to be based on the rational planning of usevalues and coordinated investment decisions to attain economic goals as a result the cyclical fluctuations that occur in a capitalist market economy will not be present in a socialist economy the value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labor cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system socialism would make use of incentivebased systems and inequality would still exist but to a diminishing extent as all members of society would be workerowners this eliminates the severity of previous tendencies towards inequality and conflicts arising over ownership of the means of production and property income accruing to a small class of owners the method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic meritocracy along the principle of from each according to his ability to each according to his contribution the advanced stage of socialism referred to as upperstage communism in the critique of the gotha programme is based on the socialist mode of production but is differentiated from lowerstage socialism in a few fundamental ways while socialism implies public ownership by a state apparatus or cooperative ownership by a worker cooperative enterprise communism would be based on common ownership of the means of production class distinctions based on ownership of capital cease to exist along with the need for a state a superabundance of goods and services are made possible by automated production that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit intermediate phasesedit the period in which capitalism becomes increasingly insufficient as an economic system and immediately after the proletarian conquest of the state an economic system that features elements of both socialism and capitalism will probably exist until both the productive forces of the economy and the cultural and social attitudes develop to a point where they satisfy the requirements for a full socialist society one that has lost the need for monetary value wage labor and capital accumulation specifically market relations will still exist but economic units are either nationalized or reorganized into cooperatives this transitional phase is sometimes described as state capitalism or market socialism china is officially in the primary stage of socialism social relationsedit the fundamental goal of socialism from the view of marx and engels was the realization of human freedom and individual autonomy specifically this refers to freedom from the alienation imposed upon individuals in the form of coercive social relationships as well as material scarcity whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself the aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the surplus product as a set of social relationships socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the associated producers so that the surplus product produced by socialized assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes the sale of labor power would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social division of labor which is to be distinguished from a nonsocial technical division of labor which would still exist in socialism the incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual laborers work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder role of the stateedit in marxist theory the state is the institution of organised violence which is used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule thus it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists the state is thus seen as a mechanism that is dominated by the interests of the ruling class and utilized to subjugate other classes in order to protect and legitimize the existing economic system after a workers revolution the state would initially become the instrument of the working class conquest of the state apparatus by the working class must take place to establish a socialist system as socialism is built the role and scope of the state changes as class distinctions based on ownership of the means of production gradually deteriorate due to the concentration of means of production in state hands from the point where all means of production become state property the nature and primary function of the state would change from one of political rule via coercion over men by the creation and enforcement of laws into a scientific administration of things and a direction of processes of production that is the state would become a coordinating economic entity rather than a mechanism of class or political control and would no longer be a state in the marxian sense see alsoedit capitalist mode of production communism economic

portal communism portal philosophy portal v t e in marxist theory socialism also called lowerstage communism or the socialist mode of production refers to a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that supersede capitalism in the schema of historical materialism the marxist definition of socialism is a mode of production where the sole criterion for production is usevalue and therefore the law of value no longer directs economic activity marxist production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning while distribution of economic output is based on the principle of to each according to his contribution the social relations of socialism are characterized by the working class effectively owning the means of production and the means of their livelihood either through cooperative enterprises or by public ownership or private artisanal tools and selfmanagement so that the social surplus accrues to the working class and society as a whole this view is consistent with and helped to inform early conceptions of socialism where the law of value no longer directs economic activity and thus monetary relations in the form of exchangevalue profit interest and wage labor would not operate and apply to marxist socialism the marxian conception of socialism stands in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism most notably early forms of market socialism based on classical economics such as mutualism and ricardian socialism unlike the marxian conception these conceptions of socialism retained commodity exchange markets for labor and the means of production seeking to perfect the market process the marxist idea of socialism was also heavily opposed to utopian socialism although karl marx and friedrich engels wrote very little on socialism and neglected to provide any details on how it might be organized numerous social scientists and neoclassical economists have used marxs theory as a basis for developing their own models of socialist economic systems the marxist view of socialism served as a point of reference during the socialist calculation debate contents  mode of production  intermediate phases  social relations  role of the state  see also  notes mode of productionedit socialism is a postcommodity economic system meaning that production is carried out to directly produce usevalue to directly satisfy human needs or economic demands as opposed to being produced with a view to generating a profit the stage in which the accumulation of capital was viable and effective is rendered insufficient at the socialist stage of social and economic development leading to a situation where production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a supposedly planned fashion although karl marx and friedrich engels understood planning to involve the input and decisions of the individuals involved at localized levels of production and consumption planning has been interpreted to mean centralized planning by marxistleninists during the th century however there have been other conceptions of economic planning including decentralizedplanning and participatory planning in contrast to capitalism which relies upon the coercive market forces to compel capitalists to produce usevalues as a byproduct of the pursuit of profit socialist production is to be based on the rational planning of usevalues and coordinated investment decisions to attain economic goals as a result the cyclical fluctuations that occur in a capitalist market economy will not be present in a socialist economy the value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labor cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system socialism would make use of incentivebased systems and inequality would still exist but to a diminishing extent as all members of society would be workerowners this eliminates the severity of previous tendencies towards inequality and conflicts arising over ownership of the means of production and property income accruing to a small class of owners the method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic meritocracy along the principle of from each according to his ability to each according to his contribution the advanced stage of socialism referred to as upperstage communism in the critique of the gotha programme is based on the socialist mode of production but is differentiated from lowerstage socialism in a few fundamental ways while socialism implies public ownership by a state apparatus or cooperative ownership by a worker cooperative enterprise communism would be based on common ownership of the means of production class distinctions based on ownership of capital cease to exist along with the need for a state a superabundance of goods and services are made possible by automated production that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit intermediate phasesedit the period in which capitalism becomes increasingly insufficient as an economic system and immediately after the proletarian conquest of the state an economic system that features elements of both socialism and capitalism will probably exist until both the productive forces of the economy and the cultural and social attitudes develop to a point where they satisfy the requirements for a full socialist society one that has lost the need for monetary value wage labor and capital accumulation specifically market relations will still exist but economic units are either nationalized or reorganized into cooperatives this transitional phase is sometimes described as state capitalism or market socialism china is officially in the primary stage of socialism social relationsedit the fundamental goal of socialism from the view of marx and engels was the realization of human freedom and individual autonomy specifically this refers to freedom from the alienation imposed upon individuals in the form of coercive social relationships as well as material scarcity whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive to reproduce his or herself the aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests creative freedom and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the surplus product as a set of social relationships socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the associated producers so that the surplus product produced by socialized assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes the sale of labor power would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social division of labor which is to be distinguished from a nonsocial technical division of labor which would still exist in socialism the incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment so that an individual laborers work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder role of the stateedit in marxist theory the state is the institution of organised violence which is used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule thus it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists the state is thus seen as a mechanism that is dominated by the interests of the ruling class and utilized to subjugate other classes in order to protect and legitimize the existing economic system after a workers revolution the state would initially become the instrument of the working class conquest of the state apparatus by the working class must take place to establish a socialist system as socialism is built the role and scope of the state changes as class distinctions based on ownership of the means of production gradually deteriorate due to the concentration of means of production in state hands from the point where all means of production become state property the nature and primary function of the state would change from one of political rule via coercion over men by the creation and enforcement of laws into a scientific administration of things and a direction of processes of production that is the state would become a coordinating economic entity rather than a mechanism of class or political control and would no longer be a state in the marxian sense see alsoedit capitalist mode of production communism economic

money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare under conditions of backwardness the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technologyit seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing usevalue of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist it would seem easier to rely on the planning of usevalues in a rational way which because there is no

abstract goals the repair of doublestranded dna breaks in drosophila mitotic cells will be analyzed genetically such breaks can be repaired by two main classes of mechanisms recombinational and endjoining these classes differ significantly in the kinds of repair products that are produced within each class multiple individual pathways are thought to exist the goal is to perform a genetic dissection of these mechanisms for each major pathway the genetic consequences and the structure of the repair products will be determined examination of these parameters in a series of mutations at loci involved in the repair processes will reveal how the pathways differ and the type of repair that is affected approach excision of p transposable elements provides a useful way to produce doublestrand breaks at specific known locations in the genome these excisions can be regulated by p transposase in addition two sitespecific endonucleases ho and iscei have been shown to function in drosophila these three methods will be used to generate specific doublestrand breaks in vivo under welldefined genetic conditions a series of tests using these sitespecific breaks will be applied in different genetic backgrounds to provide a detailed description of the consequences of doublestrand break repair different pathways for repair will be distinguished by mutating genes thought to be involved with one or more mechanism seven genetic loci involved with repair were selected to include a variety of such functions two recentlydeveloped methods will be used to obtain mutations the first generates p insertions in or near the targeted genes and the second uses these insertions to obtain flanking deletions which knock out the genes medical significance dna repair is recognized as crucial to maintaining the stability of the genome especially in species with complex genomes human mutations in many dna repair genes including the human homologs of several of the loci in the present study cause predisposition to cancer a better understanding of these repair processes can come from studies using drosophila which like humans has a relatively complex genome and multicellular organization thus requiring a high level of genomic stability at the same time drosophila gives researchers the genetic tools needed to analyze the multipathway repair system   funding agency

elisabeth elise franziska mauritia von haar  his parents were pietistic protestantcitation needed and engels was raised accordingly as he grew up however he developed atheistic beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained his mother wrote to him of her concerns she said that he had really gone too far and begged him to proceed no further she continued you have paid more heed to other people to strangers and have taken no account of your mothers pleas god alone knows what i have felt and suffered of late i was trembling when i picked up the newspaper and saw therein

palatinate revolutionary uprising at  friedrich had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances he spent a year in barmen in  his father sent the young man to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in bremen his parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business his revolutionary activities disappointed them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation he wrote under a pseudonym friedrich oswald to avoid connecting his life in a pietist industrialist family with his provocative writings in  engels joined the prussian army as a member of the household artillery he was assigned to berlin where he attended university lectures at the university of berlin and began to associate with groups of young hegelians he anonymously published articles in the rheinische zeitung exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers the editor of the rheinische zeitung was karl marx engels did not meet marx until late november  engels acknowledged the influence of german philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his life he also wrote to get the most out of life you must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr eugen dührings revolution in science edit main article antidühring popularly known as antidühring herr eugen dührings revolution in science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of eugen dühring a german philosopher and critic of marxism in the course of replying to dühring engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work dialectics of nature three chapters of antidühring were later edited and published under the separate title socialism utopian and scientific socialism utopian and scientific edit main article socialism utopian and scientific in what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece engels critiques the utopian socialists such as fourier and owen and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of historical materialism dialectics of nature edit dialectics of nature german dialektik der natur is an unfinished  work by engels that applies marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science it was first published in the ussr in  the origin of the family private property and the state edit main article the origin of the family private property and the state the origin of the family private property

german cotton textile manufacturer friedrich sr  and elisabeth elise franziska mauritia von haar  his parents were pietistic protestantcitation needed and engels was raised accordingly as he grew up however he developed atheistic beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained his mother wrote to him of her concerns she said that he had really gone too far and begged him to proceed no further she continued you have paid more heed to other people to strangers and have taken no account of your mothers pleas god alone knows what i have felt and suffered of late i was trembling when i picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my sons arrest when his mother wrote engels was in hiding in brussels belgium soon to make his way to switzerland in  he returned to the kingdom of bavaria for the baden and palatinate revolutionary uprising at  friedrich had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances he spent a year in barmen in  his father sent the young man to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in bremen his parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business his revolutionary activities disappointed them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles

must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr eugen dührings revolution in science edit main article antidühring popularly known as antidühring herr eugen dührings revolution in science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of eugen dühring a german philosopher and critic of marxism in the course of replying to dühring engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work dialectics of nature three chapters of antidühring were later edited and published under the separate title socialism utopian and scientific socialism utopian and scientific edit main article socialism utopian and scientific in what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece engels critiques the utopian socialists such as fourier and owen and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of historical materialism dialectics of nature edit dialectics of nature german dialektik der natur is an unfinished  work by engels that applies marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science it was first published in the ussr in  the origin of the family private property and the state edit main article the origin of the family private property and the state the origin of the family private property and the state is a work connecting capitalism with what engels argues is an everchanging institution – the family it was written when engels was  years of age and at the height of his intellectual power it contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class female subjugation and private property

them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles

hegelians he anonymously published articles in the rheinische zeitung exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers the editor of the rheinische zeitung was karl marx engels did not meet marx until late november  engels acknowledged the influence of german philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his life he also wrote to get the most out of life you must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr eugen dührings revolution in science edit main article antidühring popularly known as antidühring herr eugen dührings revolution in science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of eugen dühring a german philosopher and critic of marxism in the course of replying to dühring engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work dialectics of nature three chapters of antidühring were later edited and published under the separate title socialism utopian and scientific socialism utopian and scientific edit main article socialism utopian and scientific in what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece engels critiques the utopian socialists such as fourier and owen and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of historical materialism dialectics of nature edit dialectics of nature german dialektik der natur is an unfinished  work by engels that applies marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science it was first published in the ussr in  the origin of the family private property and the state edit main article the origin of the family private property and the state the origin of the family private property and the state is a work connecting capitalism with what engels argues is an everchanging institution – the family it was written when engels was  years of age and at the height of his intellectual power it contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class female subjugation and private property

no further she continued you have paid more heed to other people to strangers and have taken no account of your mothers pleas god alone knows what i have felt and suffered of late i was trembling when

young man to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in bremen his parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business his revolutionary activities disappointed them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles

must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr eugen dührings revolution in science edit main article antidühring popularly known as antidühring herr eugen dührings revolution in science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of eugen dühring a german philosopher and critic of marxism in the course of replying to dühring engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work dialectics of nature three chapters of antidühring were later edited and published under the separate title socialism utopian and scientific socialism utopian and scientific edit main article socialism utopian and scientific in what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece engels critiques the utopian socialists such as fourier and owen and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism and an outline of the progression of social and

german cotton textile manufacturer friedrich sr  and elisabeth elise franziska mauritia von haar  his parents were pietistic protestantcitation needed and engels was raised accordingly as he grew up however he developed atheistic beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained his mother wrote to him of her concerns she said that he had really gone too far and begged him to proceed no further she continued you have paid more heed to other people to strangers and have taken no account of your mothers pleas god alone knows what i have felt and suffered of late i was trembling when i picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my sons arrest when his mother wrote engels was in hiding in brussels belgium soon to make his way to switzerland in  he returned to the kingdom of bavaria for the baden and palatinate revolutionary uprising at  friedrich had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances he spent a year in barmen in  his father sent the young man to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in bremen his parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business his revolutionary activities disappointed them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation he wrote under a pseudonym friedrich oswald to avoid connecting his life in a pietist industrialist family with his provocative writings in  engels joined the prussian army as a member of the household artillery he was assigned to berlin where he attended university lectures at the university of berlin and began to associate with groups of young hegelians he anonymously published articles in the rheinische zeitung exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers the editor of the rheinische zeitung was karl marx engels did not meet marx until late november  engels acknowledged the influence of german philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his life he also wrote to get the most out of life you must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr eugen dührings revolution in science edit main article antidühring popularly known as antidühring herr eugen dührings revolution in science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of eugen dühring a german philosopher and critic of marxism in the course of replying to dühring engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work dialectics of nature three chapters of antidühring were later edited and published under the separate title socialism utopian and scientific socialism utopian and scientific edit main article socialism utopian and scientific in what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece engels critiques the utopian socialists such as fourier and owen and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of historical materialism dialectics of nature edit dialectics of nature german dialektik der natur is an unfinished  work by engels that applies marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science it was first published in the ussr in  the origin of the family private property and the state edit main article the origin of the family private property and the state the origin of the family private property and the state is a work connecting capitalism with what engels argues is an everchanging institution – the family it was written when engels was  years of age and at the height of his intellectual power it contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class female subjugation and private property

german cotton textile manufacturer friedrich sr  and elisabeth elise franziska mauritia von haar  his parents were pietistic protestantcitation needed and engels was raised accordingly as he grew up

no further she continued you have paid more heed to other people to strangers and have taken no account of your mothers pleas god alone knows what i have felt and suffered of late i was trembling when i picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my sons arrest when his mother wrote engels was in hiding in brussels belgium soon to make his way to switzerland in  he returned to the kingdom of bavaria for the baden and palatinate revolutionary uprising at  friedrich had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances he spent a year in barmen in  his father sent the young man to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in bremen his parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business his revolutionary activities disappointed them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation he wrote under a pseudonym friedrich oswald to avoid connecting his life in a pietist industrialist family with his provocative writings in  engels joined the prussian army as a member of the household artillery he was assigned to berlin where he attended university lectures at the university of berlin and began to associate with groups of young hegelians he anonymously published articles in the rheinische zeitung exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers the editor of the rheinische zeitung was karl marx engels did not meet marx until late november  engels acknowledged the influence of german philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his life he also wrote to get the most out of life you must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr eugen dührings revolution in science edit main article antidühring popularly known as antidühring herr eugen dührings revolution in science is a detailed critique of the philosophical positions of eugen dühring a german philosopher and critic of marxism in the course of replying to dühring engels reviews recent advances in science and mathematics seeking to demonstrate the way in which the concepts of dialectics apply to natural phenomena many of these ideas were later developed in the unfinished work dialectics of nature three chapters of antidühring were later edited and published under the separate title socialism utopian and scientific socialism utopian and scientific edit main article socialism utopian and scientific in what he presented as an extraordinarily popular piece engels critiques the utopian socialists such as fourier and owen and provides an explanation of the socialist framework for understanding capitalism and an outline of the progression of social and economic development from the perspective of historical materialism dialectics of nature edit dialectics of nature german dialektik der natur is an unfinished  work by engels that applies marxist ideas – particularly those of dialectical materialism – to science it was first published in the ussr in  the origin of the family private property and the state edit main article the origin of the family private property and the state the origin of the family private property and the state is a work connecting capitalism with what engels argues is an everchanging institution – the family it was written when engels was  years of age and at the height of his intellectual power it contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class female subjugation and private property

german cotton textile manufacturer friedrich sr  and elisabeth elise franziska mauritia von haar  his parents were pietistic protestantcitation needed and engels was raised accordingly as he grew up however he developed atheistic beliefs and his relationship with his parents became strained his mother wrote to him of her concerns she said that he had really gone too far and begged him to proceed no further she continued you have paid more heed to other people to strangers and have taken no account of your mothers pleas god alone knows what i have felt and suffered of late i was trembling when i picked up the newspaper and saw therein that a warrant was out for my sons arrest when his mother wrote engels was in hiding in brussels belgium soon to make his way to switzerland in  he returned to the kingdom of bavaria for the baden and palatinate revolutionary uprising at  friedrich had dropped out of high school due to family circumstances he spent a year in barmen in  his father sent the young man to work as a nonsalaried office clerk at a commercial house in bremen his parents expected that he would follow his father into a career in business his revolutionary activities disappointed them it would be some years before he joined the family firm whilst at bremen engels began reading the philosophy of hegel whose teachings dominated german philosophy in september  he published his first work a poem entitled the bedouin in the bremisches conversationsblatt no  he also engaged in other literary and journalistic work also while at bremen engels began writing newspaper articles critiquing the societal ills of industrialisation he wrote under a pseudonym friedrich oswald to avoid connecting his life in a pietist industrialist family with his provocative writings in  engels joined the prussian army as a member of the household artillery he was assigned to berlin where he attended university lectures at the university of berlin and began to associate with groups of young hegelians he anonymously published articles in the rheinische zeitung exposing the poor employment and living conditions endured by factory workers the editor of the rheinische zeitung was karl marx engels did not meet marx until late november  engels acknowledged the influence of german philosophy on his intellectual development throughout his life he also wrote to get the most out of life you must be active you must live and you must have the courage to taste the thrill of being young   citation needed manchesteredit in  his parents sent the yearold engels to manchester england a manufacturing centre he was to work in weaste in the offices of ermen and engelss victoria mill which made sewing threads engelss father thought that working at the manchester firm might make his son reconsider some of his liberal opinions on his way to manchester engels visited the office of the rheinische zeitung and met karl marx for the first time they were not impressed with each other marx mistakenly thought that engels was still associated with the berliner young hegelians with whom marx had just broken off ties in manchester engels met mary burns a fierce young working woman with radical opinions they began a relationship that lasted  years until her death in  the two never married as both were against the institution of marriage while engels regarded stable monogamy as a virtue he considered the current state and churchregulated marriage as a form of class oppression burns guided engels through manchester and salford showing him the worst districts for his research while in manchester between october and november  engels wrote his first economic work entitled outline of a critique of political economy engels sent the article to paris where marx published it in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher in  while observing the slums of manchester in close detail engels took notes of its horrors notably child labour the despoiled environment and overworked and impoverished labourers he sent a trilogy of articles to marx these were published in the rheinische zeitung and then in the deutsch–französische jahrbücher chronicling the conditions among the working class in manchester he later collected these articles for his influential first book the condition of the working class in england  written between september  and march  the book was published in german in  in the book engels described the grim future of capitalism and the industrial age noting the details of the squalor in which the working people lived the book was published in english in  archival resources contemporary to engelss stay in manchester shed light on some of the conditions he describes including a manuscript mmm held by special collections at the university of manchester which recounts cases seen in the manchester royal infirmary where industrial accidents dominate and which resonates with his comments on the deformed persons seen walking round manchester as a result of such accidents engels continued his involvement with radical journalism and politics he frequented areas popular among members of the english labour and chartist movements whom he met he also wrote for several journals including the northern star robert owens new moral world and the democratic review newspaper parisedit a famous early photograph of engels which has been asserted as showing him at age  in  at age  in  at age  in  in his twenties and at other ages in other years according to other claimants or guessers engels decided to return to germany in  on the way he stopped in paris to meet karl marx with whom he had an earlier correspondence marx had been living in paris since late october  after the rheinische zeitung was banned in march  by prussian governmental authorities prior to meeting marx engels had become established as a fully developed materialist and scientific socialist independent of marxs philosophical development in paris marx was publishing the deutsch–französische jahrbücher engels first met marx at the café de la régence on the place du palais  august  the two quickly became close friends and remained so their entire lives marx had read and was impressed by engelss articles on the condition of the working class in england marx adopted engelss idea that the working class would lead the revolution against the bourgeoisie as society advanced toward socialism and incorporated this as part of his own philosophy in late may  engels published the english version of his new book he wrote a class which bears all the disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages … who can demand that such a class respect this social order engels stayed in paris to help marx write the holy family it was an attack on the young hegelians and the bauer brothers and was published in late february  engelss earliest contribution to marxs work was writing for the deutsch–französische jahrbücher edited by both marx and arnold ruge in paris in  during this time in paris both marx and engels began their association with and then joined the secret revolutionary society called the league of the just the league of the just had been formed in  in france to promote an egalitarian society through the overthrow of the existing governments in  the league of the just participated in the  rebellion fomented by the french utopian revolutionary socialist louis auguste blanqui however as ruge remained a young hegelian in his belief marx and ruge soon split and ruge left the deutsch–französische jahrbücher nonetheless following the split marx remained friendly enough with ruge that he sent ruge a warning on  january  that the paris police were going to execute orders against him marx and others at the deutsch–französische jahrbücher requiring all to leave paris within  hours marx himself was expelled from paris by french authorities on  february  and settled in brussels with his wife and one daughter having left paris on  september  engels returned to his home in barmen germany to work on his the condition of the working class in england which was published in late may  even before the publication of his book engels moved to brussels in late april  to collaborate with marx on another book german ideology while living in barmen engels began making contact with socialists in the rhineland to raise money for marxs publication efforts in brussels however these contacts became more important as both marx and engels began political organising for the german workers party brusselsedit from  to  engels and marx lived in brussels spending much of their time organising the citys german workers shortly after their arrival they contacted and joined the underground german communist league the communist league was the successor organisation to the old league of the just which had been founded in  but had recently disbanded influenced by wilhelm weitling the communist league was an international society of proletarian revolutionaries with branches in various european cities the communist league also had contacts with the underground conspiratorial organisation of louis auguste blanqui many of marxs and engelss current friends became members of the communist league old friends like georg friedrich herwegh who had worked with marx on the rheinsche zeitung heinrich heine the famous poet a young doctor by the name of roland daniels heinrich bürgers and august herman ewerbeck all maintained their contacts with marx and engels in brussels georg weerth who had become a friend of engels in england in  now settled in brussels karl wallau and stephen born real name simon buttermilch were both german immigrant typesetters who settled in brussels to help marx and engels with their communist league work marx and engels made many new important contacts through the communist league one of the first was wilhelm wolff who was soon to become one of marxs and engelss closest collaborators others were joseph weydemeyer and ferdinand freiligrath a famous revolutionary poet while most of the associates of marx and engels were german immigrants living in brussels some of their new associates were belgians phillipe gigot a belgian philosopher and victor tedesco a lawyer from liège both joined the communist league joachim lelewel a prominent polish historian and participant in the polish uprising of – was also a frequent associate the communist league commissioned marx and engels to write a pamphlet explaining the principles of communism this became the manifesto of the communist party better known as the communist manifesto it was first published on  february  and ends with the worldfamous phrase let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletariat have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win  working men of all countries unite return to prussiaedit there was a revolution in france in  that soon spread to other western european countries this event caused engels and marx to go back to their homeland of the prussian empire specifically the city of cologne while living in cologne they created and served as editors for a new daily newspaper called the neue rheinische zeitung besides marx and engels other frequent contributors to the neue rheinische zeitung included karl schapper wilhelm wolff ernst dronke peter nothjung heinrich bürgers ferdinand wolf and carl cramer friedrich engelss mother herself gives unwitting witness to the effect of the neue rheinische zeitung on the revolutionary uprising in cologne in  criticising his involvement in the uprising she states in a  december  letter to friedrich that nobody ourselves included doubted that the meetings at which you and your friends spoke and also the language of neue rhz were largely the cause of these disturbances at the time of this letter friedrich engelss even more dangerous involvement in the revolutionary uprisings in baden and the palatinate in  still lay ahead of him engelss parents hoped that young friedrich would decide to turn to activities other than those which you have been pursing sic in recent years and which have caused so much distress at this point friedrichs parents felt the only hope for their son was to emigrate to america and start his life over they told him that he should do this or he would cease to receive money from us however the problem in the relationship between friedrich and his parents was worked out without engels having to leave england or being cut off from financial assistance from his parents in july  friedrich engelss father arrived to visit him in manchester england during the visit his father arranged for friedrich to meet peter ermen of the office of ermond  engels to move to liverpool and to take over sole management of the office in manchester starting with an article called the magyar struggle written on  january  friedrich engels himself began a series of reports on the revolution and war for independence of the newly founded hungarian republic engelss articles on the hungarian republic became a regular feature in the neue rheinische zeitung under the heading from the theater of war however during the june  prussian coup détat the newspaper was suppressed after the coup marx lost his prussian citizenship was deported and fled to paris and then london engels stayed in prussia and took part in an armed uprising in south germany as an aidedecamp in the volunteer corps of august willich engels also brought two cases of rifle cartridges with him when he went to join the uprising in elberfeld on  may  later when prussian troops came to kaiserslautern to suppress an uprising there engels joined a group of volunteers under the command of august willich who were going to fight the prussian troops when the uprising was crushed engels was one of the last members of willichs volunteers to escape by crossing the swiss border marx and others became concerned for engelss life until they finally heard from him engels traveled through switzerland as a refugee and eventually made it to safety in england on  june  prussian authorities issued an arrest warrant for friedrich engels which contained a physical description as height  feet  inches hair blond forehead smooth eyebrows blond eyes blue nose and mouth well proportioned beard reddish chin oval face oval complexion healthy figure slender special characteristics speaks very rapidly and is shortsighted as to his shortsightedness engels admitted as much in a letter written to joseph weydemeyer on  june  in which he says he was not worried about being selected for the prussian military because of my eye trouble as i have now found out once and for all which renders me completely unfit for active service of any sort once he was safely in switzerland engels began to write down all his memories of the recent military campaign against the prussians this writing eventually became the article published under the name the campaign for the german imperial constitution back in britainedit friedrich engelss house in primrose hill london in order to help marx with the new publishing effort in london neue rheinische zeitung politischökonomische revue engels sought ways to escape the continent and travel to london on  october  engels arrived in the italian port city of genoa there engels booked passage on the english schooner cornish diamond under the command of a captain stevens the voyage across the western mediterranean around the iberian peninsula by sailing schooner took about five weeks finally on  november  the cornish diamond sailed up the river thames to london with engels on board once engels made it to britain he decided to reenter the manchester company in which his father held shares in order to be able to support marx financially so that marx could work on his masterpiece das kapital engels didnt like the work but did it for the good of the cause unlike his first period in england  engels was now under police surveillance he had official homes and unofficial homes all over salford weaste and other innercity manchester districts where he lived with mary burns under false names to confuse the police little more is known as engels destroyed over  letters between himself and marx after the latters death so as to conceal the details of their secretive lifestyle despite his work at the mill engels found time to write his monumental work on martin luther the protestant reformation and the  revolutionary war of the peasants this work was entitled the peasant war in germany engels also wrote some important newspaper articles such as the campaign for the german imperial constitution which he finished in february  and on the slogan of the abolition of the state and the german friends of anarchy written in october  in april  engels wrote the pamphlet conditions and prospects of a war of the holy alliance against france when louis bonaparte carried out a coup against the french government and made himself president for life on  december  marx and engels like many people were shocked in condemning this action engels wrote to marx about the coup on  december  engels characterised the coup as comical and referred to it as occurring on the th brumaire—the date of the coup according to the  republican calendar of france under napoleon i marx was later to incorporate this comically ironic characterisation of louis bonapartes coup into his essay about the coup indeed marx even called the essay the eighteenth brumaire of louis bonaparte again using engelss suggested characterisation marx also borrowed engels characterisation of hegels notion of the world spirit that history occurred twice once as a tragedy and secondly as a farce in the first paragraph of his new essay meanwhile at the mill owned by his father in manchester engels started working as an office clerk the same position he held in his teens while in germany where his fathers company was based however friedrich worked his way up to become a partner of the firm in citation needed five years later engels retired from the business and could focus more on his studies at this time marx was living in london but they were able to exchange ideas through daily correspondence one of the ideas that engels and marx contemplated was the possibility and character of a potential revolution in the russias as early as april  engels and marx anticipated an aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia which would begin in st petersburg with a resulting civil war in the interior the model for this type of aristocraticbourgeois revolution in russia against the autocratic czarist government in favour of a constitutional government had been provided by the decembrist revolt of  although an unsuccessful revolt against the czarist government in favour of a constitutional government both engels and marx anticipated a bourgeois revolution in russia would occur which would bring about a bourgeois stage in russian development to precede a communist stage by  both marx and engels began to contemplate a course of development in russia that would lead directly to the communist stage without the intervening bourgeois stage this analysis was based on what marx and engels saw as the exceptional characteristics of the russian village commune or obshchina although doubt was cast on this theory by georgi plekhanov plekhanovs reasoning was based on the first edition of das kapital  which predated marxs interest in russian peasant communes by two years later editions of the text demonstrate marxs sympathy for the argument of nikolay chernyshevsky that it should be possible to establish socialism in russia without an intermediary bourgeois stage provided that the peasant commune were used as the basis for the transition in  engels moved to london where he and marx lived until marxs death in  his london home during this period and until his death was  regents park road primrose hill nw marxs first london residence was a cramped apartment at  dean street soho from  he lived at  grafton terrace kentish town and then in a tenement at  maitland park road from  until his death mary burns suddenly died of a heart disease in  after which engels became close with her younger sister lydia lizzie they lived openly as a couple in london and married on  september  hours before lizzies death later yearsedit after marxs death engels devoted much of his remaining years to editing marxs unfinished volumes of capital however he also contributed significantly in other areas engels made an argument using anthropological evidence of the time to show that family structures changed over history and that the concept of monogamous marriage came from the necessity within class society for men to control women to ensure their own children would inherit their property he argued a future communist society would allow people to make decisions about their relationships free of economic constraints one of the best examples of engelss thoughts on these issues are in his work the origin of the family private property and the state engels died of throat cancer in london  following cremation at woking crematorium his ashes were scattered off beachy head near eastbourne as he had requested personalityedit friedrich engels in  engelss interests included poetry fox hunting and hosting regular sunday parties for londons leftwing intelligentsia where as one regular put it no one left before two or three in the morning his stated personal motto was take it easy while jollity was listed as his favourite virtue tristram hunt author of marxs general the revolutionary life of friedrich engels sums up the disconnect between engelss personality and those soviets who later utilised his works stating this great lover of the good life passionate advocate of individuality and enthusiastic believer in literature culture art and music as an open forum could never have acceded to the soviet communism of the th century all the stalinist claims of his paternity notwithstanding as to the religious persuasion attributable to engels hunt writes in that sense the latent rationality of christianity comes to permeate the everyday experience of the modern world—its values are now variously incarnated in the family civil society and the state what engels particularly embraced in all of this was an idea of modern pantheism or rather pandeism a merging of divinity with progressing humanity a happy dialectical synthesis that freed him from the fixed oppositions of the pietist ethos of devout longing and estrangement through strauss i have now entered on the straight road to hegelianism the hegelian idea of god has already become mine and thus i am joining the ranks of the modern pantheists engels wrote in one of his final letters to the soontobediscarded graebers wilhelm and friedrich priest trainees and former classmates of engels engels was a polyglot and was able to write and speak in languages including russian italian portuguese irish gaelic spanish polish french english and milanese dialect legacyedit vladimir lenin wrote after his friend karl marx who died in  engels was the finest scholar and teacher of the modern proletariat in the whole civilised world in their scientific works marx and engels were the first to explain that socialism is not the invention of dreamers but the final aim and necessary result of the development of the productive forces in modern society all recorded history hitherto has been a history of class struggle of the succession of the rule and victory of certain social classes over others but labour party politician tristram hunt argues that engels has become a convenient scapegoat too easily blamed for the state crimes of the soviet union communist southeast asia and china engels is left holding the bag of th century ideological extremism hunt writes while marx is rebranded as the acceptable postpolitical seer of global capitalism hunt largely exonerates engels stating that in no intelligible sense can engels or marx bear culpability for the crimes of historical actors carried out generations later even if the policies were offered up in their honor other writers while admitting the distance between marx and engels and stalin are less charitable noting for example that the anarchist bakunin predicted the oppressive potential of their ideas it is a fallacy that marxisms flaws were exposed only after it was tried out in power marx and engels were centralisers while talking about free associations of producers they advocated discipline and hierarchy paul thomas of the university of california berkeley claims that while engels had been the most important and dedicated facilitator and diffuser of marxs writings he significantly altered marxs intents as he held edited and released them in a finished form and commentated on them engels attempted to fill gaps in marxs system and extend it to other fields he stressed historical materialism in particular assigning it a character of scientific discovery and a doctrine indeed forming marxism as such a case in point is antidühring which supporters of socialism like its detractors treated as an encompassing presentation of marxs thought and while in his extensive correspondence with german socialists engels modestly presented his own secondary place in the couples intellectual relationship and always emphasised marxs outstanding role russian communists like lenin raised engels up with marx and conflated their thoughts as if they were necessarily congruous soviet marxists then developed this tendency to the state doctrine of dialectical materialism in  engelss magnificent beard inspired a climbing wall sculpture in salford the  feet  m high beard statue — a symbol of wisdom and learning — was planned to stand on the campus of the university of salford the arts company behind the piece engine said that the idea came from a s plan to relocate an eastern bloc statue of the thinker to manchester major worksedit cover of the st edition of engelss the origin of the family private property and the state first published in  the holy family edit the holy family was a book written by marx and engels in november  the book is a critique on the young hegelians and their trend of thought which was very popular in academic circles at the time the title was a suggestion by the publisher and is meant as a sarcastic reference to the bauer brothers and their supporters the book created a controversy with much of the press and caused bruno bauer to attempt refuting the book in an article published in wigands vierteljahrsschrift in  bauer claimed that marx and engels misunderstood what he was trying to say marx later replied to his response with his own article published in the journal gesellschaftsspiegel in january  marx also discussed the argument in chapter  of the german ideology the condition of the working class in england edit main article the condition of the working class in england the condition of the working class in england is a detailed description and analysis of the appalling conditions of the working class in britain during engelss stay in manchester and salford the work also contains seminal thoughts on the state of socialism and its development it was considered a classic in its time and must have been an eyeopener for most germans the work initially made rather little impact in england as it was not translated until the end of the nineteenth century it was however very influential with historians of british industrialisation throughout the twentieth century herr
