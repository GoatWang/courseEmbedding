table of contents overview during the first three quarters of fiscal  demand for new homes continued to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we experienced across most of our operating markets in fiscal  we continue to see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each markets economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we have focused on expanding our product offerings to consistently include a broad range of homes for entrylevel moveup and luxury buyers across most of our markets our affordable entrylevel homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers as the entrylevel segment of the new home market remains underserved with low inventory levels relative to demand since the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have been introducing affordable homes in communities designed for active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle we plan to continue to expand our product offerings across more of our operating markets during the third quarter of fiscal  the number and value of our net sales orders increased  and  respectively compared to the prior year quarter and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased  and  respectively our pretax income in the third quarter was  million compared to  million in the prior year quarter and our pretax operating margin was  compared to  we believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings our ample supply of finished lots land and homes our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced personnel across our operating markets we remain focused on growing our profitability generating positive annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each markets economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets if the us economy continues to improve we expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards   table of contents strategy our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk this strategy includes the following initiatives • maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt • allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk • offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entrylevel moveup active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market • modifying product offerings sales pace home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand • managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold completed homes in inventory • investing in land and land development and pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets relative to the local new home demand • increasing the amount of land and finished lots controlled through option purchase contracts by expanding relationships with land developers across the country • controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors • improving the efficiency of our land development construction sales and other key operational activities • controlling our selling general and administrative sga expense infrastructure to match production levels we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to maintain and improve our competitive position financial performance and balance sheet strength however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions   table of contents key results key financial results as of and for the three months ended june   as compared to the same period of  were as follows homebuilding •

activity the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in the three and nine months ended june   the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased  and  respectively primarily as a result of the  increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in both periods combined with a slight increase in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the

million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively from  million and  million in the prior year periods while the number of loan originations increased  and  during the same periods revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume in the ninemonth period primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and increased revenue from title operations our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by  million and  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively and by  million and  million in the prior year periods to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated loan repurchase requests received actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates which may result in future changes to our loss reserves general and administrative ga expense from financial services and other operations increased  to  million and  to  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively from  million and  million in the prior year periods these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs due to both increased volume and the cost of compliance with mortgage industry regulations our financial services and other operations employed  and  employees at june   and  respectively as a percentage of financial services and other revenues ga expense was  and  in the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the prior year periods fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some

periods our effective tax rate was  and  for the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the prior year periods the effective tax rate for all periods includes an expense for state income taxes reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits we previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method with the internal revenue service irs relating to changes in the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes we agreed to and signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended june   the impact of the approved tax accounting method changes on our consolidated financial statements as of june   was a reduction in income taxes payable of  million a reduction in deferred tax assets of  million and income tax expense of  million the third request for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method will be recognized in the period in which a consent agreement is issued by the irs and agreed to and signed by us at june   and september   we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of  million and  million respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of  million and  million respectively the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance for both periods relates to our state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards as of june   we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards   table of contents capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other operations with

september   and  at june   over the long term we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below  and we expect it to remain significantly lower than  throughout fiscal  and

homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient

table of contents overview during the first three quarters of fiscal  demand for new homes continued to reflect the stable to moderately improved trends we experienced across most of our operating markets in fiscal  we continue to see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each markets economy as measured by job growth household incomes household formations and consumer confidence our position as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales in recent years we have focused on expanding our product offerings to consistently include a broad range of homes for entrylevel moveup and luxury buyers across most of our markets our affordable entrylevel homes have experienced very strong demand from homebuyers as the entrylevel segment of the new home market remains underserved with low inventory levels relative to demand since the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have been introducing affordable homes in communities designed for active adult buyers seeking a lowmaintenance lifestyle we plan to continue to expand our product offerings across more of our operating markets during the third quarter of fiscal  the number and value of our net sales orders increased  and  respectively compared to the prior year quarter and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased  and  respectively our pretax income in the third quarter was  million compared to  million in the prior year quarter and our pretax operating margin was  compared to  we believe our business is well positioned for the future because of our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings our ample supply of finished lots land and homes our strong balance sheet and liquidity and our experienced personnel across our operating markets we remain focused on growing our profitability generating positive annual cash flows from operations and managing our product offerings pricing sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each markets economy therefore we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets if the us economy continues to improve we expect to see slow to moderate growth in housing demand concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions decreases in the level of employment and housing demand decreased home affordability significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards   table of contents strategy our operating strategy focuses on leveraging our financial and competitive position to increase the returns on our inventory investments and generate strong profitability and cash flows while managing risk this strategy includes the following initiatives • maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position and controlling our level of debt • allocating and actively managing our inventory investments across our operating markets to diversify our geographic risk • offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entrylevel moveup active adult and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market • modifying product offerings sales pace home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand • managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand and actively controlling the number of unsold completed homes in inventory • investing in land and land development and pursuing opportunistic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets relative to the local new home demand • increasing the amount of land and finished lots controlled through option purchase contracts by expanding relationships with land developers across the country • controlling the cost of goods purchased from both vendors and subcontractors • improving the efficiency of our land development construction sales and other key operational activities • controlling our selling general and administrative sga expense infrastructure to match production levels we believe our operating strategy which has produced positive results in recent years will allow us to maintain and improve our competitive position financial performance and balance sheet strength however we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions   table of contents key results key financial results as of and for the three months ended june   as compared to the same period of  were as follows homebuilding •

revenues land sales and other revenues were  million and  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively and  million and  million in the comparable periods of  we continually evaluate our land and lot supply and fluctuations in revenues and profitability from land sales occur based on how we manage our inventory levels in various markets we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them however some of the land that we purchase includes commercially zoned parcels that we may sell to commercial developers we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our supply or for other strategic reasons as of june   we had  million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months   table of contents inventory and land option charges at june   we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our communities and land inventories for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities and land inventories with a combined carrying value of  million and recorded impairment charges of  million

were  million and  million of impairment charges recorded in the three and nine months ended june   respectively as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows we may modify our pricing and incentives construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment also if housing or economic conditions weaken in specific markets in which we operate or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges during the three and nine months

sga expense decreased  basis points to  and  in the three and nine months ended june   respectively from  and  in the prior year periods this improvement in sga expense as a percentage of revenues was

attempt to control our sga costs while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our operations we expect our sga expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to be lower in fiscal  than in fiscal  interest incurred we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction active inventory capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer interest incurred decreased  to  million and  to  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to the prior year periods these

activity the volume of loans originated by our mortgage operations is directly related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in the three and nine months ended june   the volume of firstlien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased  and  respectively primarily as a result of the  increase in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations in both periods combined with a slight increase in our mortgage capture rate the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers financing in the ninemonth period our mortgage capture rate was  and  in the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the prior year periods home closings from our homebuilding operations constituted  of dhi mortgage loan originations in both the three and nine months ended june   compared to  in both prior year periods these rates reflect dhi mortgages consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations the number of loans sold increased  and  in the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to the prior year periods virtually all of the mortgage loans held for sale on june   were eligible for sale to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or the government national mortgage association ginnie mae approximately  of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during the nine months ended june   were sold to three major financial entities one of which purchased  of the total loans sold financial services and other revenues and expenses revenues from our financial services and other operations increased  to  million and  to  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively from  million and  million in the prior year periods while the number of loan originations increased  and  during the same periods revenues increased at a higher rate than origination volume in the ninemonth period primarily due to improved loan sale execution in the secondary market and increased revenue from title operations our mortgage operations revenues were reduced by  million and  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively and by  million and  million in the prior year periods to increase our loss reserves for estimated future recourse obligations and other mortgage loans and to adjust certain mortgage loans held for sale to fair value our loss reserves for loan recourse obligations are estimated based upon analysis of the volume of mortgages originated loan repurchase requests received actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests and discussions with our mortgage purchasers actual losses on mortgage loans may differ from our estimates which may result in future changes to our loss reserves general and administrative ga expense from financial services and other operations increased  to  million and  to  million in the three and nine months ended june   respectively from  million and  million in the prior year periods these increases were primarily due to increases in employee related costs due to both increased volume and the cost of compliance with mortgage industry regulations our financial services and other operations employed  and  employees at june   and  respectively as a percentage of financial services and other revenues ga expense was  and  in the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the prior year periods fluctuations in financial services ga expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned interest and other income net of other expense included in our financial services and other operations consists primarily of the interest income of our mortgage subsidiary   table of contents results of operations  consolidated income before income taxes pretax income for the three and nine months ended june   was  million and  billion respectively compared to  million and  million for the prior year periods the increase in our operating income is primarily due to higher revenues from increased home closings income taxes our income tax expense for the three and nine months ended june   was  million and  million respectively compared to  million and  million in the prior year periods our effective tax rate was  and  for the three and nine months ended june   respectively compared to  and  in the prior year periods the effective tax rate for all periods includes an expense for state income taxes reduced by tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction and federal energy tax credits we previously filed three requests for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method with the internal revenue service irs relating to changes in the timing of income and expense recognition for tax purposes we agreed to and signed consent agreements for two of the three requests during the quarter ended june   the impact of the approved tax accounting method changes on our consolidated financial statements as of june   was a reduction in income taxes payable of  million a reduction in deferred tax assets of  million and income tax expense of  million the third request for advance consent for a change in tax accounting method will be recognized in the period in which a consent agreement is issued by the irs and agreed to and signed by us at june   and september   we had deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities of  million and  million respectively partially offset by valuation allowances of  million and  million respectively the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position also changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance for both periods relates to our state deferred tax assets for net operating loss nol carryforwards as of june   we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets we will continue to evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to our remaining state nol carryforwards   table of contents capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services and other operations with cash flows from operating activities borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities our current levels of cash borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to changes in homebuilding market conditions and allow us to increase our investments in homes finished lots land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability at june   our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital homebuilding notes payable divided by total equity plus homebuilding notes payable was  compared to  at september   and  at june   over the long term we intend to maintain our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital below  and we expect it to remain significantly lower than  throughout fiscal  and  we believe that the ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase facility is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities we believe that our existing cash resources our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our nearterm working capital needs we expect to have the cash on hand and other immediately available capital to fund the approximately  million cash consideration for the proposed

evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august  registering debt and equity securities

covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity in addition the credit agreement

cash and cash equivalents  at june   cash and cash equivalents of our financial services and other operations totaled  million mortgage repurchase facility  our mortgage subsidiary dhi mortgage has a

repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to thirdparty purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from  to  days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase

credit facility at a sufficient capacity and on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain
