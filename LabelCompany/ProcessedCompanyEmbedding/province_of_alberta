river is the peace river with an average flow of  ms the peace river originates in the rocky mountains of northern british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river a tributary of the mackenzie river moraine lake in banff national park albertas capital city edmonton is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately  km  mi south of edmonton and  km  mi north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost  of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta

and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climateedit winter scene at banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from − °c − °f in northern alberta to − °c − °f in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from  °c  °f in the mountains to over  °c  °f in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over  km  mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from  mm  in in the southeast to  mm  in in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach  mm  in annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  °c  °f in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around  °c  °f in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding köppen climate types in alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between  up to just under  hours per year northern alberta gets about  hours of daylight in the summer in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from − to  °c − to  °f in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging  to  chinook days per year calgary has a  chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an  chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north after saskatchewan alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of  verified per year thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgary–edmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada which is caused by orographic lifting from

prairie in the summer months between july and september the southern and east central parts of alberta are covered by short prairie grass which dries up as summer lengthens to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower fleabane and sage both yellow and white sweet clover can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides these are largely deciduous typically aspen poplar and willow many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain on the

the four climatic regions alpine boreal forest parkland and prairie of alberta are home to many different species of animals the south and central prairie was the land of the bison commonly known as buffalo its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement but since then buffalo have made a comeback living on farms and in parks all over alberta alberta is home to many large carnivores among them are the grizzly and black bears which are found in the mountains and wooded regions smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes wolves fox lynx bobcat and mountain lion cougar herbivorous animals are found throughout the province moose mule deer elk and whitetail deer are found in the wooded regions and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern alberta bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains rabbits porcupines skunks squirrels and many species of

found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta alberta is the only province in canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of norwegian rats since the early s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in  alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in  several rats were found and captured in small pockets in southern alberta putting albertas ratfree status in jeopardy a colony of

the most thoroughly studied dinosaurbearing strata in alberta dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments historyedit alexander c rutherford albertas first premier view from morants curve beside the bow valley parkway and the bow river within banff national park main article history of alberta paleoindians arrived in alberta at least  years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in  the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier on june   during the  alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries a dozen municipalities in southern alberta declared local states of emergency on june  as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under

approximately in the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately  km  mi south of edmonton and  km  mi north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost  of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climateedit winter scene at banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from − °c − °f in northern alberta to − °c − °f in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from  °c  °f in the mountains to over  °c  °f in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over  km  mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from  mm  in in the southeast to  mm  in in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach  mm  in annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  °c  °f in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around  °c  °f in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding köppen climate types in alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between  up to just under  hours per year northern alberta gets about  hours of daylight in the summer in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from − to  °c − to  °f in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging  to  chinook days per year calgary has a  chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an  chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the

salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta alberta is the only province in canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of norwegian rats since the early s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in  alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in

dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to

article history of alberta paleoindians arrived in alberta at least  years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in  the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier on june   during the  alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries a dozen

british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river a tributary of the mackenzie river moraine lake in banff national park albertas capital city edmonton is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately  km  mi south of edmonton and  km  mi north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost  of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climateedit winter scene at banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from − °c − °f in northern alberta to − °c − °f in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from  °c  °f in the mountains to over  °c  °f in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over  km  mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from  mm  in in the southeast to  mm  in in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach  mm  in annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  °c  °f in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around  °c  °f in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding köppen climate types in alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between  up to just under  hours per year northern alberta gets about  hours of daylight in the summer in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from − to  °c − to  °f in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging  to  chinook days per year calgary has a  chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an  chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north after saskatchewan alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of  verified per year thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgary–edmonton corridor is notable

whitefish rainbow speckled brown trout and sturgeon bull trout native to the province is albertas provincial fish turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta alberta is the only province in canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of norwegian rats since the early s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in  alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in

dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to

article history of alberta paleoindians arrived in alberta at least  years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in  the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier on june   during the  alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries a dozen

estimated to be  trillion barrels  km many companies employ both conventional strip mining and nonconventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands as of late  there were over  billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since  have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss by mid however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the athabasca region in may  with concerted effort and support from the provincial government

approximately in the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately  km  mi south of edmonton and  km  mi north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost  of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climateedit winter scene at banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from − °c − °f in northern alberta to − °c − °f in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from  °c  °f in the mountains to over  °c  °f in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over  km  mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from  mm  in in the southeast to  mm  in in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach  mm  in annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  °c  °f in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around  °c  °f in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding köppen climate types in alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between  up to just under  hours per year northern alberta gets about  hours of daylight in the summer in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from − to  °c − to  °f in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging  to  chinook days per year calgary has a  chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an  chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the

early s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in  alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in

dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to

article history of alberta paleoindians arrived in alberta at least  years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in  the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier on june   during the  alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries a dozen

billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since  have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss by mid however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening

approximately in the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately  km  mi south of edmonton and  km  mi north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost  of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climateedit winter scene at banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from − °c − °f in northern alberta to − °c − °f in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from  °c  °f in the mountains to over  °c  °f in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over  km  mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from  mm  in in the southeast to  mm  in in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach  mm  in annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  °c  °f in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around  °c  °f in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding köppen climate types in alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between  up to just under  hours per year northern alberta gets about  hours of daylight in the summer in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from − to  °c − to  °f in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging  to  chinook days per year calgary has a  chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an  chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the

early s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in  alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in

dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to

article history of alberta paleoindians arrived in alberta at least  years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in  the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier on june   during the  alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries a dozen

billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since  have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss by mid however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening

british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river a tributary of the mackenzie river moraine lake in banff national park albertas capital city edmonton is located approximately in the geographic centre of the province it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately  km  mi south of edmonton and  km  mi north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost  of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park near brooks alberta showcases the badlands terrain desert flora and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape climateedit winter scene at banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from − °c − °f in northern alberta to − °c − °f in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from  °c  °f in the mountains to over  °c  °f in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over  km  mi from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from  mm  in in the southeast to  mm  in in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach  mm  in annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around  °c  °f in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around  °c  °f in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions sometimes persisting for several years although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation and sometimes resulting in flooding köppen climate types in alberta alberta is a sunny province annual bright sunshine totals range between  up to just under  hours per year northern alberta gets about  hours of daylight in the summer in southwestern alberta the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period during one chinook recorded at pincher creek temperatures soared from − to  °c − to  °f in just one hour the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks averaging  to  chinook days per year calgary has a  chance of a white christmas while edmonton has an  chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north after saskatchewan alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of  verified per year thunderstorms some of them severe are frequent in the summer especially in central and southern alberta the region surrounding the calgary–edmonton corridor is notable

salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta alberta is the only province in canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of norwegian rats since the early s the government of alberta has operated a ratcontrol program which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail in  alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos universities and colleges and recognized research institutions in

dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to

article history of alberta paleoindians arrived in alberta at least  years ago toward the end of the last ice age they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a living after the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in  the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britain fur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territories the district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier on june   during the  alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow elbow highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries a dozen

the east of edmonton the athabasca oil sands surrounding fort mcmurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be  trillion barrels  km many companies employ both conventional strip mining and nonconventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands as of late  there were over  billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since  have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss by mid however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the athabasca region in may  with concerted effort and support from the provincial government

carbon levy and rebates putting a price on carbon is the most costeffective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change alberta’s carbon levy provides a financial incentive for families businesses and communities to lower their emissions economists agree that a price on carbon is the most costeffective way to reduce emissions it drives innovation and changes behaviour by encouraging individuals and businesses to become more energy efficient and shift away from higher emission fuels the levy will also help diversify our energy industry and create new jobs and is

marked gas and diesel used on farms will be exempt from the levy the levy doesnt apply to electricity all revenue from the levy will be reinvested back into alberta to grow and diversify our economy

considerably average high temperatures in january range from  °c  °f in the southwest to − °c − °f in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain

other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation

siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples including the plains indian tribes of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree who generally lived by hunting buffalo american bison and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted trapped and fished for a livingafter the british arrival in canada approximately half of the province of alberta south of the athabasca river drainage became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company hbc in  and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it after the arrival of french canadians in the west around  they settled near fur trading posts establishing communities such as lac la biche and bonnyville fort la jonquière was established near what is now calgary in the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay and they were prime habitat for furbearing animals the first explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond who learned of the methye portage which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land fur traders formed the north west company nwc of montreal to compete with the hbc in  the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in  roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in  his cousin sir alexander mackenzie followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton then setting northward on foot trekked to the athabasca river which he followed to lake athabasca it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean returning to lake athabasca he followed the peace river upstream eventually reaching the pacific ocean and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexicothe extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french and spanish territory of louisiana sold to the united states in  in  the portion of louisiana north of the fortyninth parallel was ceded to great britainfur trade expanded in the north but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc and in  the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until  when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land northern alberta was included in the northwestern territory until  when it and ruperts land became canadas northwest territoriesthe district of alberta was created as part of the northwest territories in  as settlement increased local representatives to the northwest legislative assembly were added after a long campaign for autonomy in  the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premieron
