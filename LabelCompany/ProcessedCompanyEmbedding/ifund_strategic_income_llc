“manager research group” in the united states that subsidiary is morningstar research services llc which is registered with and governed by the us securities and exchange commission the manager research group evaluates funds based on five key pillars which are process performance people parent and price the manager research group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark or in the case of exchangetraded funds and index mutual funds a relevant peer group over the long term on a riskadjusted basis they consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research and the weight of each pillar may vary the analyst rating scale is gold silver bronze neutral and negative a morningstar analyst rating of gold

overseen by an analyst rating committee and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to globalmorningstarcommanagerdisclosures the morningstar analyst rating i should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund ii involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected and iii should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost
