french fries soft drinks milkshakes and desserts after being acquired by its miami florida franchisees and renamed in  bk began expanding its menu by adding the whopper sandwich in  and has since added nonbeef items such as chicken fish and vegetarian offerings including salads and meatless sandwiches other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as icees juices and bottled waters as the company expanded both inside and outside the united states it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs to generate additional sales bk occasionally introduces limitedtime offers of special versions of its products or brings out completely new products intended for either long or shortterm sales not all of these products and services have been successful in  burger king introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued the company introduced the first iteration of its breakfast menu along with the companys specialty sandwich product line in a  menu expansion the products were some of the first designed by a fast food restaurant chain that were intended to capture the adult market members of which would be willing to spend more on a higherquality product the expanded burger king menu was part of a plan by thencompany president donald n smith to reach the broadest possible demographic market to better compete with mcdonalds and to fend off then newcomer wendys who had a growing market share the plan was successful the companys sales increased by  percent despite another menu expansion in  the companys market gains diminished due to neglect of the brand at the hands of thenparent pillsbury and its successors grand metropolitan and diageo when the company was sold to a group led by tpg capital in  the trend of targeting an expanded audience was renewed under a plan by its thenceo brad blum during blums tenure the company added several products that featured higherquality ingredients and other menu fare that again attempted to appeal to the adult palate and demographic as in the past not all of these products met corporate sales expectations or in the case of several of its larger offerings resulted in negative publicity due to nutritional concerns with the purchase of the company in  by g capital the company again began another revamp of its product line by phasing out some products introducing new ones and redesigning others including its flagship whopper sandwich like its menu the equipment the company cooks its hamburgers with has also evolved as the company grew the burgers have always been broiled mechanically the original unit called an instabroiler was one of two pieces of equipment the founders of instaburger king purchased before opening their new restaurant the instabroiler worked by cooking  burger patties in a wire basket allowing the patties to be cooked from both sides simultaneously with the acquisition of the chain by its miami franchisees came an improved unit dubbed a flame broiler designed by the new owners it featured stationary burners that cooked the meat on a moving chain the unit broke down less often while maintaining a similar cooking rate the cooking format remained for the next  years until burger king developed a new variable speed broiler that could handle multiple items with different cooking rates and times these new unit began testing in  and eventually evolved into the two models the company deployed systemwide in – accompanying these new broilers was new foodholding equipment and a computerbased product monitoring system for its cooked products the new system allows for more concise tracking of product quality

signature product when the predecessor to the modern burger king instaburger king opened in  in jacksonville florida the companys menu consisted predominantly of hamburgers french fries soft drinks and desserts instaburger king was acquired in  by two of its franchisees james mclamore and david edgerton who renamed it burger king under its new ownership the company continued to develop its core menu cooking techniques and equipment in  mclamore and edgerton created bks signature item the whopper as a way to differentiate bk from other burger outlets at the time the whopper is a  oz  g hamburger with lettuce tomato mayonnaise pickle and ketchup that was priced at ¢ the sandwich was designed to give the customer a larger product with better value than competitors who were selling burgers with an average price of ¢ as burger kings flagship product the whopper has been expanded beyond the original sandwich into a line of sandwiches all made with the same ingredients the whopper sandwich has undergone several modifications in its recipe over the years with a change from a plain bun to a sesame seed roll in the early s and a change in patty size in the mids being two of the most notable since its inception the whopper has become synonymous with burger king and become the focus of much of its advertising the company has even named its kioskstyle restaurants whopper bars in  donald n smith was hired from mcdonalds to help restructure the corporate operations of burger king to better compete against his former company as well as the then upandcoming chain wendys as part of an operational overhaul he dubbed operation phoenixnotes  one of his first changes to the companys menu was to add the burger king specialty sandwich line in  this line—with many nonhamburger sandwiches including chicken and fish—significantly expanded the breadth of the bk menu it was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic in this case adults aged between  and  years members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher quality productnotes  the new products were successful and the companys sales increased by  percent while most of the line has since been discontinued the companys original chicken sandwich is still offered in all of its global markets and the ham and cheese sandwich is a regional offering bk chicken tenders made their debut in a menu revision and expansion in  to address the absence of a chickenbased finger product akin to mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets the product had to be temporarily withdrawn because of limited availability of chicken meat it was reintroduced about six months later originally made with sliced fillets of chicken the product was changed to a formed choppedchicken product several years later in  bk rolled out the burger bundles a pack of six mini burger sliders similar to white castle was brought back later as the burger buddy fish tenders were introduced to complement chicken tenders during a menu expansion in  the new fish product sold in the same style of container as the chicken tenders was an order of fish sticks with tartar sauce for dipping portion sizes were similar to those of the chicken tenders fish tenders were discontinued in notes  a bk original chicken sandwich one of the products introduced under operation phoenix in  the company introduced its first broiled chicken sandwich the bk broiler in  the sandwich included a dillranch mayonnaise and was served on an oatbran roll in  bk reformulated the bk broiler into a larger more maleoriented sandwich a larger chicken patty with mayonnaise served on a whopper bun in  bk changed the name of the sandwich to chicken whopper and added a smaller chicken whopper jr sandwich the company replaced the chicken whopper line with another broiled sandwich line in  the bk baguette line the chicken sandwich served on a fresh cooked baguette roll and came in several varieties all of which were topped with a series of ingredients that were low in fat they were sold in the united states at one time but are now sold only in the european market the failed baguette line was replaced in north america with the current grilled chicken iteration the tendergrill sandwich although wendys was the first to have a value menu in  burger king decided to offer its own value menu in  this menu featured seven products the whopper jr a fivepiece chicken tenders a bacon cheeseburger mediumsized french fries medium soft drink medium onion rings and a small milkshake – all priced at ¢ usd in  and  bk revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the rodeo cheeseburger many of these items such as chili tacos the sourdough burger a product similar to the whopper jr but with sourdough bread and chicken tender sandwiches have since been discontinued modified or relegated to regional menu options returning to the practice of targeting the adult demographic as it had in  bk introduced several new products to its menu in  the new products included new or revamped chicken sandwiches a new salad line and its bk joe brand of coffee the first of these items was the tendercrisp chicken sandwich an entirely new sandwich which featured a fried  oz  g wholemuscle chicken breast on a corndusted roll the sandwich was part of thenceo greg brennemans plans to bolster the companys revived have it your way advertising program which was designed to draw younger people to its stores some items including the enormous omelet sandwich line and the bk stacker line brought negative attention due the large portion size amounts of unhealthy fats and the presence of transfats at the time many of the products featured higherquality ingredients like whole chicken breast angus beef cheddar cheese and pepper jack cheese not all the products new products introduced under blums tenure met corporate sales expectations the baguette chicken sandwiches being an example others products such as burger kings line of indulgent burgers originally called the angus burger have undergone multiple reformulations the angus steak burger was originally based around a  oz  g frozen patty despite high expectations from the company the sandwich fared poorly after a reformulating program it was relaunched in  as the  oz  g angus steakhouse burger with the introduction of a new multifunction broiler capable of cooking a more diverse set of products burger king replaced the angus steakhouse burger with the  oz  g steakhouse xt burger in notes  in  the company discontinued selling the product in the north american market replacing it with the chefs choice burger the chefs choice burger was removed in   saw the introduction of the newest attempt at introducing a premium burger to the companys portfolio with the introduction of the a ultimate cheeseburger in north america the burger bundles returned in  with beef and chicken patty options ancillariesedit a package of burger kings zesty onion ring dipping sauce during  bk revamped its french fries in north america the improved fries were coated with a layer of potatobased starch giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer the company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than mcdonalds fries in consumer taste comparisons other ads featured mr potato head in a series of demographicallytargeted commercials the fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began in europe bk also sells potato wedges a type of french fry that is thickcut and wedgeshaped in  the company introduced twister fries spiralcut fries with a spicy coating as part of a promotional push part of the products appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton the product was designed as a shortterm promotion that would be periodically reintroduced in  burger king offered shake em up fries which included a bag of fries and a packet of spices the customer would add the spices to the fries and then shake the bag until the fries were coated beyond french fries the company has introduced several other side products over the course of its existence onion rings have been part of the menu for the majority of bk history originally made from whole sliced onions they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in  as part of a menu revamp in the same  menu revamp the company added an onion ringspecific dipping sauce

broiler unit developed by burger king and duke manufacturing one of two models the company deployed in the united states the predecessor to burger king instaburger king began deploying the original broiling device in  when its owners matthew burns and kieth kramer acquired the rights to george reads instshake and instabroiler machines the instabroiler cooked the burgers in a wire basket between two broilers allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously the machine was capable of cooking over  patties per hour which allowed the company to grow rapidly when mclamore and edgarton opened their first instaburger king location in miami they revamped the unit into what they called a flame broiler – the forerunner of the modern unit used by burger king today after the acquisition of instaburger king in  the pair contracted the construction of the newly designed flame broilers to the saniserv company of indianapolis indiana for the initial run of broilersnotes  eventually the company moved the manufacturing contract for the broiler units to nieco automatic broilers of windsor california who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the s when the time came for the company to develop a new broiler it turned to its equipment manufacturer nieco and st louis missouribased duke manufacturing burger kings goal was to maintain the companys trademark flame broiling method while allowing more product options on a flexible cooking platform the solutions that nieco and duke devised met that goal by using control features during cooking the cooking methods employed by the two manufacturing companies vary in their methods nieco employed two chains one that maintained a single speed and cooking temperature and another that had a flexible speed setting and variable temperature control dukes solution utilizes an oven that cooks according to preset parameters for time and temperature one heterogeneous product batch at a timenotes  the first batchstyle broiler was introduced in april  and was tested instore in central wisconsin during the summer of  a nieco mbp flexible broiler another model the company deployed in the united states beyond the flexibility of the new broilers the new equipment has several features intended to decrease operational costs a more efficient design of the burners in the nieco units produces a  percent reduction in energy consumption the duke units produce a   annual savings on energy compared to the original units which ran approximately at full capacity all day the units are so fuelefficient that in many us states the company and its franchises qualify for energyefficiency rebatesnotes  however and issue arose in september  when the state of washington department of health warned burger king of issues with the duke units in multiple incidents in seven counties throughout the state the duke units were found to have cracked heat spreaders which resulted in under cooked products additionally there was foreign material contamination caused by loose insulation resulting from the cracks as well as other issues upon notification burger king released a statement that the company has notified

kitchen minder monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products initially developed from  to  the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by duke the initial test designs were timeconsuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually this meant several minutes were required for each product which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each when bk finally deployed the system in  the updated units utilized a palm pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via infrared or serial port a kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system

concerns the superfanedit see also the burger king one particular market target that was of importance to the company was identified as the superfan the superfan was a demographic group that included individuals that are  to  years old primarily male who would visit a fastfood restaurant five times a month and eat fast food  times a month burger king and their competitors hope to attract this group because of the large sums of money that they represent an increase in sales to this group could drive an increase in global sales while superfans accounted for less than  percent of burger kings customer base they accounted for nearly  percent of the companys business by focusing on this demographic group the company could increase sales more readily it was easier to generate more repeat visits by this demographic than it was to coax new customers to switch from other chains the company has used advertising featuring its mascot the burger king in tandem with new product rollouts such as its bk wrapper product to help generate an increased number of visits by this client segment with the slowing of the global economy due to the financial crisis of  the company experienced a downside of focusing so much on this demographic group the high unemployment of the recession coupled with healthier eating habits drove many customers away from fast food towards the fastcasual segment or forced them to stop eating out analysts have stated that by focusing its marketing and advertising programs on men bk alienated women and children morgan stanley analyst john glass stated maybe catering to the super fan was the correct strategy to kickstart the business but maybe they relied on that for too long to help counter the perceived male bias of its superfan target group the company expanded the definition in early  to cover individuals of both sexes all ages and households who frequent fast food within the stated time frame throughout  the company added newer

its salad line again in  with the introduction of its fire grilled salad products burger king sought to differentiate this line of salads by packaging the warm meat toppings—a choice of grilled shrimp

in the united states that changed with the sale of the company in  the new owners relaxed the mandated hours for stores to be open from  am to midnight monday through saturday and  am to midnight on sundays franchises were encouraged to stay open later or for  hours in markets that could support the business packagingedit burger kings product packaging has undergone many changes over the years unlike mcdonalds the company never used the clamshell style box made of styrofoam so when the environmental concerns over styrofoam came to a head in the late s the company touted its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches when mcdonalds moved to eliminate its styrofoam packaging burger king ran several sarcasticallyworded ads in national newspapers stating that it had always wrapped its sandwiches in waxed paper they welcomed mcdonalds to the clubnotes  to cut back on the amount of paper that the company used the paperboard box was mostly eliminated in  it was replaced with waxed papernotes  paperboard boxes are still used for its finger food products like chicken tenders and fries french toast sticks and desserts in  the company committed itself to a redesign of its entire packaging line that tied the packaging into its irreverent advertising campaign created by crispin porter  bogusky each products packaging included a tongueincheek commentary about the product itself alex bogusky partner and executive creative director of cpb stated that bk decided to create a dialogue with the consumer by utilizing the large areas of white space found on its packaging at the time all of its sandwich wrappers cartons tray liners bags breakfast platters chili cups condiments and regional product packaging received what was described as quirky ad copy specifically targeting the –yearold male demographic segment besides the humorous commentary the company also created sniglettype names for things that would appear in its products such as a ringer – a single onion ring that had been accidentally included in an order of fries the frypod and bk chicken fries products two examples of burger kings packaging designed to fit in a cup holder starting with the introduction of its bk chicken fries product in  bk began adapting some of its product packaging so that it could be placed in an automotive cup holder the bk chicken fry box while square in shape will sit comfortably in the cup holder and its top when opened forms a small tray that is designed to hold dipping sauce burger king credits the design of this box with helping to make its chicken fries the most popular adultoriented chicken product in the united states it has since added a trademarked and patented round french fry container which it calls the frypod which is a paper cup made from  percent recycled materials that is designed to fit in an automotive cup holder the package design won an honorable mention at a packaging industry design competition bks large and king sized beverage containers are made from molded hdpe plastic with a funnellike shaped bottom that allows the oversized cups to fit in cup holders union packaging a minorityowned philadelphiabased paper products

covered  bk locations in the united statesnotes  union was instrumental in the development of the frypod carton and its efforts earned the company a supplier of the year award from burger king in  reformulationsedit over time the company reformulates various products in an attempt to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste appearance or physical consistency of the product one such example of this is the bk big fish the companys fish sandwich offering in north america burger kings original fish sandwich introduced as early as the late s in some markets was called the whaler it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll bk used for their hamburgers when burger king introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in  the bk broiler it changed the fish sandwichs breading to a panko style began serving it on an oatmealdusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich and renamed the product the ocean catch sandwich when bk reformulated the bk broiler the company also reformulated the ocean catch as the bk big fish in its current configuration the sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phaseout of the baguette sandwiches and was reintroduced as the big fish in  one of the companys larger product reformulations came in march  the company updated the recipe of its  yearold chicken tender product line by reformulating the breading and spice mixture while updating the shape the new formulation was described by the company as being more broadly appealing to the palate of its customers according to statement released by the company nations restaurant news analyst john barone stated that the change may also be due to an industry wide move to chickenbased product as a result of raising commodity prices forcing restaurants to turn towards chickenbased offerings due to the elevated pork and beef prices occurring during the previous year he added that chicken breast costs have been down or flat during the same period making it a more appealing choice to companies the new product push was accompanied with a product tiein with the movie hop aimed at the youth market an

this can be seen in some of its former products the companys first wrap product called a bk wrapper was introduced in north america as a breakfast option in april  with a lunchdinner version offered in september  these products were in response to industry trends towards products that are easier to consume on the go and to trends that began in  regarding smaller foods originally a limited time
