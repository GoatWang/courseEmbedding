compensation wrongful termination see all practice areas how to find and hire a great lawyerdo i need a lawyerwhat do lawyers do exactlylawyers also called attorneys or counsel serve as advocates for people and organizations they represent clients both to the court and to opposing parties lawyers can represent clients in criminal cases where a law has been broken and in civil cases in which one party is suing anotherlawyers are also important partners in situations that don’t involve the courtroom advising clients about their legal rights and obligations for personal or business issues they are trained to interpret complicated systems of laws and navigate the court systemwhat can a lawyer do for mefirst a lawyer will advise you as to whether or not you actually need legal help it’s not always obvious whether an issue is a legal matter or something that can be resolved without involving the court system a lawyer will help you answer these initial questionsonce you’ve decided to hire a lawyer then they have the power to represent you to the court and to opposing parties your lawyer is your most important ally in any legal matter they provide advice on how to proceed with your legal issue and prepare important documents for youif your issue involves going to court your lawyer will accompany you and can speak for you if your legal matter involves mediation or arbitration your lawyer will negotiate with the opposing party on your behalflets find your lawyerwhat type of lawyer do i needwhat practice area should i choosemany lawyers tend to focus only on one area or several related areas of law in your search for the right lawyer you should look for a lawyer who understands and has experience in the specific area of law for your issue for example a divorce lawyer may not be able to help you if you are considering declaring bankruptcy for your business but a bankruptcy lawyer who understands bankruptcy and business law would be a perfect match reputable lawyers will be upfront about their experience and specific focus but it will save you some time by narrowing your search beforehandtop  practice areas for   attorneysavvo attorneys handle cases in over  practice areas including divorce criminal defense and bankruptcyfind the practice area that fits your issueis practice size and type something i should consider when i’m looking for a lawyerpractice size is definitely something you should take into account some firms consist of only one lawyer while some firms retain hundreds there are many different types of law firms some of which focus on very specific issues while others may be more general for instance a large corporate firm may not help if you only need a lawyer to review a contract or a few documents but may be the right choice if you are filing a personal injury suit against a large company if your legal issue involves only small sums of money or a few documents a small firm may be more costeffective the size of a practice may also determine how quickly you will be able to actually speak to your potential lawyer larger offices may require you to schedule your initial consultation through a lawyer’s assistant or secretarynumber of avvo attorneys who offer free consultationslets find your lawyerhow do i narrow the list of possible lawyers to contactshould location be a major factor in my search for a lawyerlocation is an important factor in looking for a lawyer to represent you since your issue will likely depend on state or local laws and regulations you will want an attorney who understands the regulations for your location on the practical side you will also want a lawyer who has an office that is convenient for you to travel to some lawyers are willing to travel to meet you but may also charge for travel time it’s usually a good idea to find a lawyer located in your geographical area besides legal knowledge of state and local laws lawyers also have practical local knowledge lawyers in specific cities or towns will also have connections to helpful agencies in that city which will expedite the process of resolving your issuewhat are other clients saying about themone of the best ways to know if an attorney is right for you are reviews read what previous clients have said about specific attorneys and their experiences once you choose an attorney to contact read all the reviews about that particular lawyer to get an idea of how they may handle your case and interact with youlets find your lawyerwhat fees and costs should i expectwhat types of payment do lawyers usually
