loginschwab client loginwealth management sitecontactnavigation fairview capital prudent stewardship of significant wealth risk investors recognize the inverse relationship between risk and reward the greater the potential reward the greater the inherent risk the reward component generally is well understood specifically investors experience reward when an asset serves the intended function of preserving value or generating income andor capital appreciationrisk though is more nuanced frequently investors associate risk with volatility we counsel clients to differentiate between the two concepts volatility simply represents the change in the value of an asset on a daytoday or monthtomonth basis nearly all asset prices fluctuate some asset values change more than others stocks v bonds for example and some periods present more volatility than others epitomized by the sharp ascent and steep decline of the “dot com” era volatility usually proves to be a temporary phenomenonwe view risk on the other hand as the potential for a permanent loss of capital unlike the temporary decline in value resulting from periodic volatility the permanent impairment of capital can structurally disrupt progress toward investment goals as long as one doesn’t need to sell when prices are low then volatility can be endured—thus the rationale for establishing liquidity needs at the inception of the relationship volatility actually is the friend of longterm investors who seek to acquire assets when prices are low then dispose of them when prices are high a little about usfairview capital
