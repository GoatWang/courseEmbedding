person  asset location submit an account debt settlement debt settlement also known as debt arbitration debt negotiation or credit settlement is an approach to debt reduction in which the debtor and creditor agree on a reduced balance that will be regarded as payment in full debt settlement is often confused with debt consolidation in debt consolidation the consumer makes monthly payments to the debt consolidator who takes a small fee and passes the rest on to the creditors this way creditors continue to receive payments each month in debt settlement the consumer makes one reduced payment or several monthly payments on an agreed upon reduced amount until the debt is settled in full the creditors get nothing until they decide to settle furthermore the debt settlement company usually instructs the consumer not to make any payments to creditors the intended effect is to scare creditors into settling the debt for less than the full amount in addition to recovering funds on behalf of clients for over  years hf holdings inc also negotiates on behalf of companies that owe money to creditors we charge a fee of  of the amount by which the outstanding balance owed is reduced its that

small business business cash flow problems  bankruptcy liability for business debts are you personally liable for your businesss debts learn whether a business creditor can come after your house bank account or other personal property by beth laurence jd share on google plus share on facebook if your business is having trouble paying its bills you may be worried about whether a creditor can come after your personal assets can a creditor raid your personal bank account garnish your wages foreclose on your house to answer these questions you need to understand whether you are personally liable for your businesss debts there is a huge difference between debts that only your business is liable for and those that you are legally responsible to pay from your personal assets if you arent personally liable for your businesss debts you have a lot less to worry about a creditor can only go after your businesss bank account and assets if your business doesnt pay its bills creditors cant take your home or other personal property but if you find out you are personally liable for your businesss debts you have a lot more to lose which debts are you personally liable for most important know that every business owner who has employees no matter whether the business is organized as a corporation llc partnership or sole proprietorship is personally liable if the business doesnt pay the taxes it withheld from employees paychecks for more about why paying these taxes is always your first priority see nolos article on prioritizing debt payments for other types of business debts your business structure as well as what kind of contract or purchase order you signed usually determines whether or not youre personally liable for a business debt lets take a look sole proprietorships and partnerships if youre operating your business as a sole proprietorship or dba or as an independent contractor you and your business are legally the same which is another way of saying that you personally owe every penny that your business cant pay so if your business doesnt have enough cash or assets to pay its debts creditors can and sometimes will take your personal assets  or at least the assets that arent protected by state exemption laws see nolos article what can creditors do if you dont pay this is also generally true for general partnerships  the partnership debt belongs to each partner personally  with this added twist each partner is personally liable for  of the businesss debts this means that if there arent enough business assets to pay the partnerships debts and your partners are broke creditors can take your partners personal assets to pay all of the businesss debts not just your pro rata share of the debts corporations and llcs if your business is organized as a corporation or llc you and your business are separate legal entities as such in theory you could have no personal liability for the debts of your business meaning that creditors cant take your house or other personal assets to pay your businesss debts even if your business cant pay them example jeans book shoppe inc orders books from  publishers and three wholesalers before the business tanks unable to pay its expenses the corporation declares bankruptcy the publishers and wholesalers bills are all unsecured debts of the corporation and jean the corporations sole shareholder is not personally responsible for paying any of them in the bankruptcy the stores inventory will be sold to the highest bidder the proceeds will be used to pay the costs of bankruptcy and the book shoppes creditors who may be fortunate to receive a few cents on the dollar however there are many ways for a shareholder or llc member to become personally liable for business debts in fact most owners of small businesses are personally liable for at least some business debts here are the most common ways the owner of a corporation or llc can become personally liable signing a personal guarantee because most suppliers banks and landlords know that shareholders or llc members dont have personal liability for the corporation or llcs debts they often wont extend credit or loan money to a small llc or corporation without the owners personal guarantee if you signed a personal guarantee for a particular loan lease or contract you promised that you would pay it personally if your business did not put another way every time you personally guaranteed that you would repay a debt you deliberately gave up your limited liability for that debt you volunteered to let the creditor sue you to take your personal assets if the business couldnt pay the debt check to see if you signed a personal guarantee on all of your business contracts for example a loan for a business vehicle or business equipment trade terms with a supplier a bank line of credit or a commercial lease offering your property as collateral banks typically require the owners of small corporations or llcs to put up their house or other real estate as security for a loan if you secured a business loan or debt by pledging property such as a house boat or car you are personally liable for the debt and if your business defaults on the loan the lender or creditor can sue you to foreclose on the property and use the proceeds to repay the debt signing a contract in your own name you may also have given up your limited liability if you were careless about signing purchase agreements and service contracts sometimes these agreements display the personal name of the business owner without the name of the corporation or llc if you signed an agreement in your personal name and not on behalf of the corporation or llc youre personally liable for the underlying debt even if it was the suppliers mistake if youre not sure whether you have given a personal guarantee on an agreement or loan check both the language of the agreement and the signature block to see whether you signed it in your name or in your capacity as an owner or officer example talia signs a loan contract as talia finke ceo of book nook inc so only her business is liable to repay the loan but she signs her commercial lease as just talia finke so she will be personally liable to the landlord if her business cant pay the rent using credit cards or personal loans to fund the business you may have used credit cards or home equity loans to obtain funds for your business which definitely means you are personally liable for those debts you are almost always personally responsible for making payments on your credit cards even if they have your business name on them under the terms of the application you signed fraud misrepresentations or sloppy recordkeeping if you personally misrepresented or lied about any facts when you were applying for a loan or credit on behalf of your corporation or llc you could be held personally liable for the debt likewise if you failed to maintain a formal legal separation between your business and your personal financial affairs creditors could try to hold you personally responsible for the businesss debts under a theory known as piercing the corporate veil this happens when a court finds that your corporation or llc is really just a sham and that it is you personally operating the business one way creditors try to pierce the corporate veil is by showing that you didnt observe the formalities imposed on corporations and llcs by state law for instance you may have made important corporate or llc decisions without recording them in minutes of a meeting or you may have paid a number of the businesss bills out of your personal checkbook or with a personal credit card even corporations or llcs owned by a single individual or a married couple have to obey these rules and formalities what can you do if you cant pay debts youre personaly liable for if youve determined youre personally liable for all or some of your businesss debts you risk being sued personally for the debt what are the chances of this for more information see nolos article what can creditors do if you dont pay if you think its likely youll be sued youll want to make sure that your business pays the debts off either

settlement is an approach to debt reduction in which the debtor and creditor agree on a reduced balance that will be regarded as payment in full debt settlement is often confused with debt consolidation in debt consolidation the consumer makes monthly payments to the debt consolidator who takes a small fee and passes the rest on to the creditors this way creditors continue to receive payments each month in debt settlement the consumer makes one reduced payment or several monthly payments on an agreed upon reduced amount until the debt is settled in full the creditors get nothing until they decide to settle furthermore the debt settlement company usually instructs the consumer not to make any payments to creditors the intended effect is to scare creditors into settling the debt for less than the full amount in addition to recovering funds on behalf of clients for over  years hf holdings inc also negotiates on behalf of companies that owe money to creditors we charge a
