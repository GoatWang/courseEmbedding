revlon strives to create and develop the most consumerpreferred brands to be the most valuable partner to our retail customers and to profitability grow the business and its value for our stakeholders history of revlon inc revlon inc operates as one of the worlds leading cosmetics companies and markets its products in over  countries under such familiar brands as revlon colorstay age defying almay and skinlights revlon also sells skin care products ultima ii vitamin c absolutes eterna  fragrances charlie and personal care products high dimension flex mitchum colorsilk ronald perelman who gained control of the company in a nasty hostile takeover in  owns approximately  percent of revlon a nail polish company is founded in  revlons first beauty item was nail enamel opaque and longlasting it was an improvement over the more transparent dyebased products of other manufacturers revlons nail polish owed its superiority to the use of pigments which also allowed a wider color range than the light red medium red and dark red then available initially the revolutionary cream enamel came from the tiny elka company in newark new jersey a polish supplier to beauty salons for whom charles revson began to work as a sales representative in  charles revson and his older brother joseph distributed elka nail polish as revson brothers within a year however charles revson decided to open his own nail polish company going into partnership with his brother and a nail polish supplier named charles r lachman who contributed the l to the revlon name revlon was formed on march   revson had a keen fashion instinct honed by his seven years of sales experience at the pickwick dress company in new york coupling this with his experience at elka he noted that the permanent wave boom was making beauty salons more popular and that demand for manicures was rising in tandem he therefore targeted beauty salons as a market nichea fortunate choice whose importance would grow within its first nine months the company boasted sales of  there was a sharp rise in sales to  in  the year the company incorporated as revlon products corporation at the end of  the company had grossed  by  sales multiplied more than  times in that year revson decided to enlarge his market by retailing his nail polish through department stores and selected drugstores this gave him access to more affluent customers as well as those with a moderate amount of money to spend on beauty products formulating a maxim he followed for the rest of his life revson steered clear of cutrate stores selling his product only at premium prices advertising helped revson stick to this rule its use was a fateful step for the industry never again would major cosmetics companies attempt to sell beauty items without it revson began by labeling his nail enamels with evocative names such as fatal apple and kissing pink which served both to describe a particular color while offering the promise of novelty at the same time the companys first commercial advertisement appeared in the new yorker in  aimed carefully at the upperincome clientele revson was trying to attract the advertisement came with a price tag of  constituting revlons entire advertising budget for the year by  revlon had a whole line of manicure products lipstick revlons next major item appeared in  a perfectionist by nature revson made sure that its quality was the best he could produce its introduction was marked by a fullcolor advertising campaign stressing the importance of cosmetics as a fashion accessory and featuring the novel idea of matching lips and fingertips the campaigns success showed in the  sales figures reaching  million they more than doubled those of  world war ii brought shortages of glass bottles and metal lipstick cases paper had to be substituted also in short supply were aromatic oils fixatives and packaging materials which had previously been imported from italy ethiopia and france since the shortages affected the entire industry secrecy was replaced by mutual cooperation new synthetics and domestic sources of supply were shared and a new us aromatics industry was born during wartime patriotic activities replaced expansion in addition to cosmetics revlon turned out firstaid kits dye markers for the navy and hand grenades for the army characteristically revsons military products were the best his company could produce his attention to detail was rewarded in  with an armynavy production award for excellence by the end of the war revlon listed itself as one of americas top five cosmetic houses expanding its capabilities the company bought graef  schmidt a cutlery manufacturer seized by the government in  because of german business ties costing  this acquisition made it possible for revlon to produce its own manicure and pedicure instruments instead of buying them from outside supply sources postwar promotions and growth postwar sales strategy too was influenced by increases in spending and department store credit sales returning interest in dress sparked the companys twiceyearly nail enamel and lipstick promotions which were crafted in anticipation of the seasons clothing fashions each promotion featured a descriptive color name to tempt the buyer fullcolor spreads in fashion magazines color cards showing the range of colors in the promotion and display cards reproducing or enlarging consumer ads packaging was designed specifically for each line the fire and ice promotion for fall  was one of the most successful its features included the cooperation of vogue magazine which planned its november issue around the lipstick and nail enamel push money given to demonstrators in stores without revlon sales staff to insure full retail coverage and radio endorsements written into scripts for performers such as bob hope and red skelton these efforts produced excellent publicity and helped to raise  net sales to almost  million the company received its next boost from its  sole sponsorship of the cbs television show the  question though initially reluctant to go ahead with this project revson was persuaded by the success of rival hazel bishop whose sponsorship of this is your life was providing serious competition for revlons lipsticks attracting a weekly audience of  million people the  question topped the ratings within four weeks of its debut revlons advertising budget for the year  million proved charles revsons adage that publicity had to be heavy to sell cosmetics as a result of the television show sales of some products increased  percent and net sales for  grew to  million from  million one year previously in november  an allegation of wiretapping was filed against revlon by hazel bishop in testimony given in a hearing before the new york state legislative committee to study illegal interception of communications the charge was denied by revlon controller william heller who nevertheless admitted monitoring employees telephones for training purposes underscoring the denial of hazel bishops charges a revlon attorney added a denunciation of wiretapping for industrial espionage and promised cooperation in efforts to stop it also in november  revlon reorganized as revlon inc a month later in december  the company went public initially offered at  per share revlon stock reached  within weeks and the company was listed on the new york stock exchange at the end of  meanwhile the success of the  question soon spurred a spinoff called the  challenge the two shows helped to raise the companys net sales figures to  million in  and to  million in  the threeyear bonanza came to an end however in  amid charges that both shows had been rigged at the resulting congressional hearings the shows producers and the revsons blamed each other nevertheless the committees verdict cleared revlon of any blame in this matter a segmented product line in the s as the s began charles revson became aware that his company was in danger of locking itself into a narrow uppermiddleclass image that could restrict sales to avoid this he borrowed a technique from general motors and segmented his product line into six principal cosmetics houses each with its own price range advertising program and image princess marcella borghese aimed for international flair revlon was the popularpriced house etherea was the hypoallergenic line natural wonder served youthful consumers moon drops catered to dry skins and ultima ii offered the most expensive products toppriced lines were sold only in department stores while others were available in other outlets this strategy allowed the company to cover a wide market area without inhouse conflict early attempts to diversify into other fields were unsuccessful for instance knomark a shoepolish company bought in  sold its shoepolish lines in  other poorly chosen acquisitions such as tydbol the maker of toiler cleansers and a  percent interest in the schick electric shaver company were also soon discarded evan picone a womens sportswear manufacturer which came with a price tag of  million in  was sold back to one of the original partners four years later for  million the companys first successful acquisition came in january  when revson bought us vitamin  pharmaceutical corporation in exchange for  million in revlon stock the buyout brought revlon a company with annual sales of  million most of them coming from a drug used to treat diabetes within a year us vitamin proved its worth with its acquisitions of laboratorios grossman a mexican pharmaceutical company as well as comparable concerns in argentina and chile in  revson traded us vitamins diabetes drug and  million cash for a group of drugs cibageigy was required to divest for antitrust reasons another us vitamin acquisition was nysco laboratories and its nyscap process for timedrelease medication this in turn led to the introduction of vasodilation drugs fully disposable injectables introduced in  also came from us vitamin the company had begun to market its products overseas at the end of the s by  when revlon debuted in japan there were subsidiaries in france italy argentina mexico and asia revlons entrance into the japanese market was typical of its international sales strategy instead of adapting its ads and using japanese models revlon chose to use its basic us advertising and models japanese women loved the american look and the success of this bold approach was reflected in the  sales figures which were almost  million by  expanding worldwide markets produced sales of  million showing a  percent increase over the figure of almost  for  planning further expansion revlon spent  million on improvements to existing facilities plus a new cosmetics and fragrance manufacturing plant in phoenix arizona during the s the company consisted of four divisions international professional products princess marcella borghese and usv pharmaceutical in  revson decided to add two more divisions cosmetics and fragrances headed by joseph anderer and the revlon development corporation which was headed by evan william mandel and concerned chiefly with longrange planning concepts and strategies for marketing opportunities acquisitions and restructuring in the s the s began with annual sales of about  million the cosmetics and fragrances division its six lines separately aimed advertised and marketed was the industry leader in all franchised retail outlets revlon fragrances such as norell and intimate for women and braggi and pub for men had also become familiar to us consumers revlon also had a new line of wigmaintenance products called wig wonder an important  acquisition was the mitchum company of tennessee makers of antiperspirants and other toiletries mitchum joined the thayer laboratories subsidiary formerly knomark mitchumthayer divisions widely publicized products required a  advertising budget of  million in  revlon introduced charlie a fragrance designed for the working womans budget geared to the under market charlie models in ralph lauren clothes personified the independent woman of the s charlie was an instant success helping to raise revlons net sales figures to  million for  and to almost  million the following year high profits notwithstanding  was a difficult year charles revson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer determined to leave a worthy successor he picked michel bergerac a president of international telephone and telegraphs european operations terms of bergeracs contract included a  million signing bonus an annual salary of  for five years bonuses and options on  shares company profitability was bergeracs chief interest impressed with revsons experienced management team he induced them to stay by introducing the performance incentive profit sharing plan which allotted each executive points based on profit objectives achieved for the years  to  he also cut company spending with tighter inventory controls and instituted an annual savings of  million by the elimination of  jobs bergerac installed a managementinformation system requiring that all managers report monthly on problems sales and competition through acquisitions bergerac tried to reduce revlons dependence on the increasingly crowded cosmetics market his first major purchase came in  coburn optical industries was an oklahomabased manufacturer of ophthalmic and optical processing equipment and supplies which cost  revlon common shares barneshind the largest us marketer of hard contact lens solutions was bought in  and strengthened revlons share of the eyecare market other acquisitions included the lewishowe company makers of tums antacid acquired in  and armour pharmaceutical company makers of thyroid medicines acquired in  these healthcare operations helped sales figures to pass the  billion mark in  bringing total sales to  billion in  by the late s company pharmaceutical research and development had extended into plasma research and new drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis and hypertension the markets for soft contact lenses and their rinsing solutions were also growing bergerac compounded a successful  by buying technicon corporation a leading maker of diagnostic and laboratory instruments for both domestic and international markets in  during the mids bergerac also organized the six cosmetics lines into three groups for easier administration revlon moon drops natural wonder and charlie now belonged to group one group two was comprised of flex haircare products and other toiletries while group three included princess marcella borghese and ultima ii the prestige cosmetic brands sold in upscale department stores the domestic cosmetics operations also included the government sales division carrying almost all the beauty lines through military exchanges and commissaries in the united states and overseas by the mids revlons healthcare companies rather than revlons beauty concerns were innovating and expanding reluctant to initiate beautyproduct development or department store promotions revlon lost ground to estée lauder a privately held company whose marketing strategy of high prices with accompanying gifts had earned it almost universal centeraisle department store space this caused revlons share to drop from  percent to  percent of department store cosmetics sales drugstore and supermarket sales were also suffering natural wonder a lowpriced line lost  percent of its supermarket volume in  alone and competitor noxells inexpensive cover girl line was claiming more drugstore sales comparisons of profits from total operations told the story  million in  sank to  million in  which fell to  million by   takeover by  industry analysts believed that revlon would be worth more if it were broken up and sold within a year this opinion was borne out by a takeover bid from the much smaller pantry pride a subsidiary of ronald perelmans macandrews  forbes holdings in defense bergerac accepted a  million offer for the cosmetics businesses from adler and shaykin a new york investment company the rest of revlon was to go to forstmann little  company a management buyout corporation for about  billion these sales however were disallowed by a delaware judge who ruled that the deal was not in revlons shareholders best interests on november   at a price of  per share totaling  billion revlon was sold to pantry pride becoming a private company and giving the name of revlon group to the former pantry pride the highly leveraged buyoutengineered with the help of junk bond king michael p milkensaddled revlon with a huge  billion debt load which was an albatross around the companys neck for years to come perelman immediately began to divest the company of the healthcare businesses by  only national health laboratories remained by the end of  perelman had recovered  billion of his borrowed funds partly by selling the eyecare businesses to the british firm of pilkington for  million divested companies were replaced with others geared to the perelman objectiverestoring the luster to the original beauty business costing about  million max factor joined the revlon lineup in  along with its halston perfume and its almay toiletries other newcomers were yves saint laurent fragrances and cosmetics charles of the ritz germaine monteil and alexandre de markoff followed soon after in  perelman spent another  million to acquire betrix a german makeup and fragrance maker other innovations of the s meshed with national trends the concern of a burgeoning older population with health and fitness led to wider company research on skincare products as well as on makeup international concerns for animal rights found a response in perelmans revlon which abandoned the draize test in  after closing its animal testing center in  revlon also sought to improve the company image when it signed supermodels cindy crawford and claudia schiffer for its advertising in the late s and early s during the late s fears of an approaching recession made bankers generally wary of highly leveraged transactions and revlons junk bonds began to lose value internal problems stemmed partly from the department store market where an attempt by revlon to economize by grouping its ritz monteil and borghese prestige brands at one counter failed other problems included the introduction of no sweat a deodorant which despite its  million introductory advertising budget failed to garner market share the reformulation of flex a popular shampoo which lost market share when revlon introduced a new formula with new packaging and a higher price and a  percent shrinkage in the fragrance market that affected the entire industry turning the corner in mids by  revlon held only  percent of the us massmarket cosmetics market losses were mounting year after year thanks in large part to the money that had to be spent each year to service the debt in  alone  million went toward debt service contributing to an operating loss of  million  million of which stemmed from extraordinary restructuring charges perelman was forced to sell still more assets to keep revlon from defaulting on its loans in addition to selling  percent of national health laboratories by  perelman had to also sell off some assets from the core cosmetics area in  max factor and betrix were sold to procter  gamble for  billion in cash sold off the following year were the highend halston and princess marcella borghese brands unfortunately for perelman such moves were not enough to gain the confidence of wall street in  perelman tried to sell  million shares of revlon stock in an initial public offering ipo at about  to  per share the ipo failed a victim of a sluggish stock market poor revlon earnings and the huge debt that continued to weigh down the cosmetics giant to shore up sagging sales revlon ceo jerry levin boosted revlons advertising budget by  percent in  to  million much of this money was spent on television advertising with less spent on print ads and instore promotions than in the past while the revlon line was promoted in this fashion and through massmarket retailers the companys only remaining premium brand ultima ii was shifted down from upscale stores to jc penney and dillards department stores early indications were positive for these moves as overall market share for the revlon group hit  percent in  by  the company was finally able to report operating income millionalthough debt service remained high at  million meanwhile the company started to develop successful new products the colorstay line of longlasting cosmetics was introduced in  with the debut of colorstay lipsticks which soon captured the top spot in its category the age defying line of cosmetics for women over  soon followed and also proved popular by  overall market share had reached  percent and what advertising age called the reborn cosmetics juggernaut unseated maybelline from the number one position in cosmetics net sales were improving steadily from  billion in  to  billion in  to  billion in  in addition while debt service remained high  million in  it was finally exceeded by operating income  million backed by what was clearly a remarkable though longincoming turnaround perelman felt confident enough to try another initial public offering in early  this time he succeeded and revlon once again became a public company although perelman retained  percent of the voting stock about  percent of overall shares were sold in the initial public offering raising about  million financial woes in the late s and beyond revlons turnaround was shortlived however and by the late s the company was plagued with problems losses began to pile up due in part to intense competition dwindling shelf space in stores inventory overstock and problems overseas saddled by over  billion in debts perelman announced that he was looking for a buyer for revlon he was unable to strike a deal however and instead began selling off parts of the company he sold revlons professional products business and its plusbelle line in  and divested the colorama brand the following year ceo jeff nugent resigned in  leaving cocacola executive jack stahl at the helm of revlon losses continued to mount as the new ceo and his team worked to save revlon from bankruptcy overall sales had fallen by  percent since  as competitors stole market share to make matters worse cosmetic sales at drugstores supermarkets and discount stores had slowed significantly over the past several years perelman set plans in motion to bail out the company offering a cash infusion of  million in  to help eliminate some of the firms debt in an attempt to bolster revlons sales the company launched an expensive marketing campaign featuring hollywood stars halle berry and julianne moore market share for revlon and almay increased slightly and the company posted a  percent increase in sales as a result while the company focused on strengthening its brands restoring growth building stronger relationships with its retail partners and revamping the organization as a whole stahl continued to have his work cut out for him a november  business week article stated today the company isnt making a dimeand stahl cant get away with that for long sales may be rising but only because of a pricey ad blitz that some outside revlon think is unsustainable indeed without the financial backing of perelman and potential debtforequity transactions that would reduce revlons debt the company faced a long road of financial difficulties in late  the company launched destination model a business plan designed to get profits back on track the models strategies were based on improving promotional and advertising success reducing manufacturing and supply chain costs and developing successful new products while effectively managing current products despite its financial position revlon management remained optimistic about its future regardless of what happened in the years to come revlons brands would no doubt continue to be
