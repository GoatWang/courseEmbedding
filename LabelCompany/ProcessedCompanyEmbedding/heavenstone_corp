analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements for the three months ended september   unaudited and  unaudited included elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q the results shown herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future periods   this discussion contains forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are based on our managements current expectations with respect to future events financial performance and operating results which statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus the risks and uncertainties discussed herein could cause our actual results to differ from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements   basis of presentation – true inception date   while our company was incorporated in the state of nevada in june  we undertook no activities until july   due to our having less than one year of actual operations we determined for financial statement purposes our true inception date to be july   the date of first activities the following discussion as well as the accompanying financial statements is presented in accordance with such determination   background and recent developments   we are a developmentstage company that was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on june   we intend to become a large real estate development and construction company with operations in the luxury vineyard estate home construction industry our ranch segment and the hospitality industry our resort segment          until such time as the results of our operations require us to do so this discussion will not present separate segment information   ranch segment  since our inception we have acquired approximately  acres of unimproved real estate located in temecula california we intend to construct our first vineyard estate home development on this land however we do not currently possess sufficient capital to complete these objectives recently we started the permitting process necessary to begin construction on our first estate home development   resort segment  we have identified one or more parcels totaling approximately  acres located in temecula on which we intend to build and operate our planned sorrento resort vineyard  winery however we do not have a contract to purchase this property and we do not currently possess sufficient capital to complete these objectives   principal factors affecting our financial performance   we expect that our operating results will be primarily affected by the following factors      •   our ability to obtain capital    •   our ability to attract buyers for our estate homes    •   our ability to attract guest to our planned resort property and    •   our ability to contain our costs and maintain our low overhead   expected financial performance   based on our current business plan we expect to incur operating losses through at least the first quarter of  however because we do not yet possess capital to commence operations in the ranch segment we cannot predict whether we will have any estate home sales prior to the end of such period   we are still required to obtain approximately  million in order to begin fullscale operations in our ranch segment and approximately  million in order to begin fullscale operations in our resort segment which includes the construction of our planned resort property there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining this needed funding   results of operations   for the three months ended september   and   during the three months ended september   the current period and the three months ended september   the prior period we generated no revenues we do not expect to generate any revenues until the second quarter of  at the earliest   for the current period we incurred a net loss of  unaudited for the prior period we incurred a net loss of  unaudited had we not experienced a reimbursement of approximately  in consulting and related fees our net loss for the current period would have been approximately  until we begin full scale business operations we expect the level of our quarterly expenses to be approximately         plan of operations   general  we require significant funding to achieve our objectives sources of funding are expected to be from sources of equity or debt financing as well as from sales of our estate homes as with any startup company that offers unproven products there is no assurance that our company will be successful with any level of additional funding   ranch segment  since our inception our ranch segment has acquired approximately  acres of unimproved real estate located in temecula california our ranch segment intends to construct our first vineyard estate home development on these properties   since acquiring these properties we have taken and will take the following actions towards obtaining needed permits and approvals for the subdivision planning construction and delivery of vineyard estate homes   completed    •   completed the preliminary application for subdivision of property    •   successfully addressed comments and concerns from county agencies with jurisdiction    •   completed required environmental and physical studies with respect to property    •   completed design of tract map and submitted for approval and    •   completed initial land development hearing county   still to complete   • submit complete improvement plans to county for review and approval – expected time for approval is between four and six months   • three months after approval of improvements plan commence street and other property improvements – approximately three months to complete   • record final tract map upon completion of improvements   • submit grading and building plans for approval upon recording final tract map – expected time for approval is approximately three months and   we expect to have obtained all of the necessary permits and approvals by early  at which time we will commence construction of our first vineyard estate home however due to the nature of this process we cannot assure you that we will be able to accomplish these objectives by such date   in addition our ranch segment plans to offer a wide array of personal services to the owners of the estate homes during and after their being built because we believe that a prompt and courteous response to an estate home purchasers needs during construction will reduce postclosing repair costs enhance our reputation for high quality service and ultimately lead to referral business from our estate home purchasers our personnel will be trained to provide exceptional service throughout the construction process which service will be provided as part of the estate home purchase price   following the completion of construction and in conjunction with the sale of homes our company is planning to provide to purchasers of our estate homes a wide array of personal services designed to enhance the luxury estate home lifestyle for additional fees the following services among others
