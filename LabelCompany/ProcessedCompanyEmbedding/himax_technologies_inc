on facebook tweet on twitter himax technologies inc nasdaqhimx through its subsidiary himax imaging has developed a new image sensor called ultrasenseir the product appears to have what it takes to get a socket in autonomous vehicles according to himax ultrasenseir is a low noise low power image sensor boasting quantum efficiency of more than  himax is portraying ultrasenseir as an advanced sensor for enabling computer and machine vision as such sensor could find use in d cameras pattern recognition and autonomous navigation one of the reasons himax believes it has a great product for machine vision applications is that integrating existing sensors presents challenges on multiple fronts ultrasenseir on the other hands offers a way to overcome those challenges “with our breakthrough ultrasenseir technology himax combines the advantages of our highly integrated low power and low noise bsi sensor technologies with nir and visible sensitivity in a very small micron pixel size to enable high resolution computer vision and nir imaging applications” said amit mittra cto of himax imaging himax’s ultrasenseir operates at  frames per second with energy consumption below mw furthermore himax said its new image sensor is easy to program and integrate autonomous vehicle market the market for vehicles capable of driving themselves is forecast to be huge in the coming years

positive on the longterm prospect of our wlo and lcos product lines judging by the expanding customer list that covers some of the worlds biggest tech names ceo jordan wu said on the q earnings call additionally theres the chance that the companys d sensing technologies may be chosen for the next iphone iteration morgan stanleys charlie chan believes that not only will the iphone incorporate himaxs d sensor tech but that its adoption in that device will spur other smartphone makers to follow suit chan believes this could end up contributing  of himaxs  revenue the case for nvidia nvidia is by far the leader in the graphics processing unit market with more than  of the discrete desktop gpu market share right now thats great news for the company as  of its revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal  came from sales to gpus for the gaming market the company had a tremendous q which ended in jan  its gaming revenue increased by  year over year data center revenue spiked  automotive revenues jumped  and professional visualization revenue ticked up  that growth is flowing from nvidias accurate belief that it can take its classleading gpus and apply their power to other uses and new markets that mentality has for example allowed the company to expand into the driverless car segment with its drive px  supercomputer and into artificial intelligence with its dgx server toshiya hari of goldman sachs believes that nvidia could take  billion to  billion in the ai space with its gpus and the company has already proved it can hold its own in the semiautonomous car market   automakers and suppliers are already using the companys drive px computer the verdict  if you step back and a take a highlevel view of these companies theres not much of a comparison sure himax has some prospects within ar and winning a spot in the next iphone could certainly help the company but himax seems to playing the same tune that it always has  trying to win a place in the next great device  and that strategy has left investors disappointed in the past   the first bet was on google glass which caused himaxs stock to pop  and later to crash then it was the prospect of making huge gains because of microsofts hololens which has since fizzled at least for now now according to morgan stanley its the iphone the potential of gains from a victory with that already hugely popular device may seem less speculative than betting on the success of an ar device but the story of small companies flying too close to apple and then getting burned is all too familiar  meanwhile nvidia is consistently growing its core gpu gaming business while successfully expanding its footprints in new markets sure the companys  share price jump over the past  months might scare off some investors who think that the stock has little room left to rise but adriverless cars and ai systems are only beginning to take off and i think nvidias solid prospects in those markets easily make it a better
