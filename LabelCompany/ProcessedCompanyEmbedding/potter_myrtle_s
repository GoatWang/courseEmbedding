killed in  by salazar slytherins basilisk under lord voldemorts tom riddle orders now she is a ghost who haunts the firstfloor girls bathroom and occasionally other bathroom facilities at hogwarts biography early life myrtle was a witch born circa late  to early  to a muggle mother and father making her a muggleborn hogwarts years she started her education at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry in  or  when she arrived at hogwarts she was sorted into the house of ravenclaw while at hogwarts she was unable to make any friends and was constantly teased and bullied because of this and her physical appearance which included glasses and acne opening of the chamber of secrets ooooh it was dreadful it happened right in here id hidden because olive hornby was teasing me about my glasses the door was locked and i was crying and then i heard somebody come in they said something funny a different language i think it mustve been anyway what really got me was that it was a boy speaking so i unlocked the door to tell him to go and use his own toilet and then i died —myrtle recounting her deathsrc in  some time into myrtles education the chamber of secrets was opened for the first time the chamber of secrets was a legendary chamber built by salazar slytherin and inside was a beast that only his heir could control it was believed that gryffindor student rubeus hagrid had opened the chamber because he was caught raising aragog an acromantula but it was actually tom marvolo riddle a slytherin student hogwarts was soon facing closure as muggleborn students were being mysteriously attacked by the mythical beast thought to be down inside the chamber death nobody missed me even when i was alive took them hours to find my body — i know i was sitting there waiting for them —myrtle regarding the finding of her bodysrc on her final day of life  june  myrtle was teased by student olive hornby she had made fun of myrtles glasses and as a result left myrtle sobbing myrtle then ran into one of the bathrooms stalls and started crying shortly after myrtle had entered the bathroom riddle entered and started speaking in parseltongue in order to open the chamber of secrets the entrance of which was hidden behind the bathroom sinks the monster of slytherin a basilisk then emerged from the entrance to the chamber of secrets the monster had been using the pipes as a means of transportation as to not be seen and therefore never being caught myrtles body being removed from school grounds myrtle still in one of the stalls recognised the voice as being from a boy opening the stalls door she planned to yell at riddle to go away on riddles command the basilisk stared at myrtle and her eyes met with the monsters since looking into a basilisks eyes is a fatal act myrtle was killed instantly and her body fell to the bathroom floor becoming toms first victim tom later known as lord voldemort used her murder to make his first horcrux the diary myrtles body was later found by hornby something that hornby did not soon forget as seen to by myrtle herself postmortem s moaning myrtle sulking in her first floor bathroom following her death myrtle returned as a ghost so she could haunt student olive hornby in revenge for her teasing and insults olive went to the ministry of magic to restrain myrtle who was thereafter obliged to remain at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry myrtle haunted the bathroom where she had died although she was sometimes seen in other bathrooms and was even flushed into the lake occasionally as a result of her haunting her favourite lavatory was rarely used and was thus available for clandestine activities such as illegal potionbrewing as long as one did not mind the company  school year harry potter did you see anyone near here that night myrtle i wasnt paying attention peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that im — that im — ronald weasley already dead — the trio ask myrtle about the attack on mrs norrissrc the true importance of myrtles bathroom was that it contained an entrance to the chamber of secrets the home of the basilisk of salazar slytherin in the – school year the chamber was opened again fifty years after its previous opening by a gryffindor first year ginny weasley who was possessed by the diary of the earlier opener tom riddle the diary was a horcrux though it was described as a memory at the time myrtle later flooded her bathroom in a fit of pique when ginny tried to dispose of the diary by flushing it down one of myrtles toilets ron weasley sees myrtle for the first time hermione granger used myrtles bathroom in  to brew polyjuice potion which harry potter and ron weasley used to impersonate slytherin students gregory goyle and vincent crabbe thus disguised they entered the slytherin common room to interrogate draco malfoy about the chamber of secrets they learned only that according to dracos father lucius malfoy the last time the chamber was open a mudblood was killed and that contrary to their suspicions draco was not the heir of slytherin myrtle speaking with harry in her bathroom about her murder harry and ron later learned from aragog the acromantula that the murdered student had been killed in a bathroom and harry realised that the student must have been myrtle myrtle was flattered by harrys request that she tell the story of her death the manner of which was one of the most important and interesting events of her short life it is possible that harry was the first person to treat it as something worth asking about myrtle remembered only having seen a pair of enormous eyes but neither harry nor ron recognised this as a clue that the monster was a basilisk hermione had already deduced the monsters nature by library research before she was petrified so myrtles clue was of no practical importance  school year oh hello harry long time — no — see hmm i was circling a blocked drain the other day and i swear i saw some polyjuice potion not being a bad boy again are you harry id put it in the water if i were you —myrtle helping harry potter with his golden egg cluesrc myrtle speaking to harry whilst he takes a bath and helping him solve the golden egg riddle during the – school year hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry hosted the triwizard tournament before the second task the champions had to solve the mystery behind their golden eggs which when opened emitted a harsh screeching sound the secret was that the noise became speech when heard underwater one champion cedric diggory decided to meditate upon the clue in the prefects bathroom myrtle spied on cedric in the tub admitting to harry that it took cedric a long time to figure it out nearly all the bubbles in the bath were gone by the time he cracked it cedric later suggested to harry potter that he take his egg the prefects bathroom with myrtles hints harry was able to decipher the riddle myrtle also appeared to harry whilst he was in the black lake and pointed him in the right direction to find the village of the merpeople thereby helping him to reach the tournament hostages before the other champions  school year hes sensitive people bully him too and he feels lonely and hasnt got anybody to talk to and hes not afraid to show his feelings and cry —moaning myrtle regarding draco malfoysrc in  draco malfoy confided in moaning myrtle about his failed attempts to assassinate albus dumbledore myrtle comforted him feeling that she understood him though in fact his situation was nothing like hers when draco and harry engaged in a violent duel myrtle as usual enjoyed the spectacle the last time myrtle was seen by harry potter was when she was ordered to leave the bathroom by severus snape alternate  myrtle sulking in her first floor bathroom contemplating being a ghost in  in an alternate reality created when interference from albus potter and scorpius malfoy resulted in cedric diggorys badly losing the first task of the triwizard tournament the two sought a way to reach hogwartss great lake unsatisfied with the changes they had made they hoped to interfere with diggory in the second task as well but in order to do so needed a means to reach the grounds they realised that they could do so from the pipes in moaning myrtles bathroom upon seeing them myrtle said it had been a while since there had been boys in her bathroom but noted that she had a soft spot for potters and was once partial to a malfoy as well as such she helped them by showing them how they could access a pipe to reach the lake after they did so harry potter draco malfoy professor mcgonagall and ginny weasley arrived in the bathroom at harrys request myrtle explained to him what the boys had told her about their plans to save the life of cedric diggory noting that she could never keep anything from him she also described him as becoming handsomer as he had aged and taller as well physical appearance myrtle dont you think i know what people say behind my back — fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable… peeves dont forget pimply — a teasing exchange between myrtle and peevessrc myrtle was a squat student with pimples and thick glasses she died in  and became a ghost wearing her school uniform as well as her glasses for eternity personality and traits shes a little sensitive —hermione grangersrc myrtle was constantly bullied during her education at hogwarts for both her physical appearance and her personality myrtle hardly ever smiled and took great offence at the smallest slight crying rivers of tears and wailing she was often upset so badly that she tried to kill herself until she realised that she was already dead myrtle did tend to be happy when something bad happened to other students like when hermione granger accidentally gained cat fur ears and a tail after taking a contaminated polyjuice potion she did however seem to warm to some male students including harry potter and draco malfoy myrtle also appeared to be a desperate flirt she constantly flirted with harry potter and showed her desperation to find love by spying on students such as cedric diggory whilst he bathed in the prefects bathroom myrtle liked to take bubble baths when she was alive due to all those pretty bubbles relationships harry potter harry if you die down there youre welcome to share my toilet —myrtle to harry before he enters the chamber of secretssrc harry potter her crush during his education at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry harry was nice to myrtle so she developed a crush on him harry wasnt exactly known to stay out of lifethreatening trouble so myrtle offered to share her toilet with him if the event that he died she also was more than happy to help harry during his studies at hogwarts with any task during his second year she helped him solve the mystery of the chamber of secrets by telling him how she died in his fourth year she helped him solve the mystery of the triwizard tournaments second task during his fourth year myrtle acted to an extent sexually towards harry while he bathed in the prefects bathroom causing him to feel uncomfortable as he did not reciprocate her attraction she acts coldly to harry when he has not visited her for a while but still remains friendly towards him it is founded that despite harrys departure from hogwarts myrtle continued to have a soft spot for harry and even commented that she could never have kept anything from him including secrets furthermore she claims that he has grown more handsome as he aged and got taller when he visited her in  to save his son draco malfoy myrtle dontdonttell me whats wrongi can help you draco malfoy no one can help me — myrtle and malfoy in the boys bathroomsrc draco malfoy her crush myrtle also got on well with draco malfoy who was harry potters enemy whilst at hogwarts despite draco being prejudiced against muggleborns and constantly bullying and threatening hermione granger for being muggleborn the two managed to become close as both needed company for comfort although it is possible that he is unaware of her status as a muggleborn prior to her demise they became friends whilst she comforted him during his sixth year at hogwarts that year draco had become a death eater and was feeling the strains of it as he was required to murder albus dumbledore he shared his feelings and thoughts with myrtle who listened and comforted him also she seems to have taken preference of draco to harry as harry never visits myrtle when she asks him to when harry saw their dots representing draco and myrtle together in the bathroom on the marauders map he ended crashing into something as he didnt pay too much attention due to the sight of the unlikely couple he was seeing on the map in  myrtle is shown to still have a partial soft spot for draco and that was always attracted to bad boys who disobeyed the rules of hogwarts olive hornby olive hornby and myrtle were very much enemies olive teased myrtle about her glasses during school and constantly bullied her when myrtle was crying in the bathroom and then got killed by the basilisk it was olive who first saw her dead body myrtle wanted revenge on olive so she stalked her wherever she went reminding her that it was her fault she was dead and how horrible she was myrtle even went so far as to interrupt her brothers wedding though that was enough for olive who went to the ministry of magic the ministry of magic demanded that myrtle stay at hogwarts myrtle claimed she didnt let olive forget her until her dying day peeves peeves both peeves and myrtle resided at the school and were known as bothersome myrtle did not like peeves who took enjoyment in bothering her as he did to everyone at nearly headless nicks death day party both peeves and myrtle attended when peeves heard hermione granger complaining about myrtle he found it as the perfect time to cause trouble peeves called myrtle over myrtle did not look happy to see him but peeves informed her that hermione was talking about her myrtle assuming she was talking behind her back ran off crying peeves seemed to enjoy her pain and began pelting her with peanuts myrtle later told harry ron and hermione that peeves made her so upset she wanted to kill herself but then of course she reminded herself that she was already dead ronald weasley maybe tom riddle got thirty owls or saved a teacher from the giant squid maybe he murdered myrtle that wouldve done everyone a favour —ronald weasley unknowingly correctly guesses that tom riddle murdered myrtlesrc ron weasley ronald weasley and myrtle seemed to not have a very good relationship ron was very blunt to her in which she would usually get upset and start to cry an example of this is when she tells them that someone threw a diary at her in which he reminds her it cant hurt her and she yells at him ron seemed to think myrtle was weird but was scared of her when she stood up to him and punched through his stomach and head to prove her point ron also bugged her about keeping a secret for a person draco malfoy claiming where would she take it to the grave or the sewers ron also made a comment saying tonks was starting to look like myrtle since sirius died this was probably not a compliment to tonks as myrtle always looked sad and angry hermione granger hermione granger it was shown that myrtle did not like hermione in the least at nearly headless nicks death day party hermione told harry and ron how horrible and whiny myrtle was peeves who overheard this called myrtle over peeves told myrtle that hermione was talking about her myrtle knew she must be talking about her meanly like most students did hermione however who never wanted to hurt myrtles feelings tried to tell myrtle how she was only saying how pretty myrtle was looking tonight however myrtle did not buy this and yelled at hermione for lying to her and left the party crying to brew the polyjuice potion hermione was in myrtles bathroom quite a lot as she knew nobody would want to go there because of myrtles presence myrtle seemed cold to hermione probably because of hermione talking bad about her at the death day party myrtle did take great enjoyment in hermione being upset though also probably because of her talking behind her back at the party when hermiones potion turned her into a cat myrtle teased and laughed at hermione only making hermione feel worse about her cat like appearance harry had never seen myrtle happier than when she was teasing hermione nearly headless nick nearly headless nick myrtles relationship with nick is unknown though he did invite her to his death day party nick probably invited her because either he liked her felt bad for her or because she is also a ghost nick and myrtle seem not to have the same point of view on death nick of course celebrates it while myrtle is highly offended and touchy about it although she sometimes likes to talk about it at length cedric diggory on the year of the triwizard tournament diggory was watched by myrtle in the prefects bathroom on the th floor when harry took his golden egg into the bathroom to have a bath myrtle talked about diggory and said that he was the handsome one media harry potter and the chamber of secrets  moaning myrtlemoaning myrtleharry potter and the chamber of secrets  myrtles storya pair of great big yellow eyesharry potter and the chamber of secrets  myrtles whiningmyrtles whiningharry potter and the goblet of fire  myrtle appearsmyrtles helping hand etymology myrtle elizabeth warren–a pretty name–my name–no need for the moaning —myrtle in an alternate src moaning myrtle myrtle is a type of evergreen shrub that is often overlooked because of its plainness native to southern europe and north africa myrtle is a variety of the colour green it is immoderately dark slightly more so than the colour spinach it is possible she was named myrtle to continue jk rowlings tradition of naming characters after flowers behind the scenes the inspiration for moaning myrtle was the frequent presence of a crying girl in communal bathrooms especially at the parties and discos of my youth this does not seem to happen in male bathrooms so i enjoyed placing harry and ron in such uncomfortable and unfamiliar territory in harry potter and the chamber of secrets and harry potter and the halfblood prince —j k rowling on her inspiration for moaning myrtle myrtle as a lego minifigure moaning myrtle was portrayed by shirley henderson in the film adaptations of harry potter and the chamber of secrets and harry potter and the goblet of fire being  ½  m and  years old when she first played moaning myrtle she is the oldest actress to play a teenage hogwarts student in the harry potter films annabel baldwin played moaning myrtle in the original west end production of harry potter and the cursed child chika sakamoto voiced myrtle in the japanese dubs the myrtle tree is a close relative of the willow tree moaning myrtle is a similar phrase to weeping willow her name is also possibly related to the moaning minnie the british name for a german wwii artillery shell that made a distinctive moaning whine before it hit myrtle is omitted from the film adaptation of harry potter and the halfblood prince according to j k rowlings early drafts for harry potter and the chamber of secrets this character was supposed to have been called wailing wanda though never seen or mentioned ron and hermione may have seen myrtle when they went back down the chamber of secrets to destroy hufflepuffs cup in deathly hallows the myrtle myrtus is a flowering plant of southern europe and north africa in greek mythology it was sacred to aphrodite goddess of love and beauty and to demeter goddess of grain and fertility pausanias relates it to the tragedy of adonis the roman poet virgil relates the myrtle to venus and used them in wedding rituals something that jewish liturgy which deemed it sacred also used myrtle has also uses in wiccan rituals and was considered medicinal by the ancients including hippocrates pliny galen and arabian writers shirley henderson playing myrtle myrtles surname was never mentioned in the novels however in  after being asked by a fan over twitter jk rowling announced it was warren and that myrtle also had a middle name elizabeth rowling also referred to the middle name of elizabeth as just one of those classic british middle names the name was later used in the play harry potter and the cursed child in one scene of chamber of secrets ron jokingly suggests that tom riddle earned his special award for services to the school for killing myrtle this foreshadows the fact that riddle did indeed kill her myrtle is shown to have a crush on harry throughout the series in the goblet of fire film the bathroom scene shows her acting sexually towards harry myrtle was also the first person to be killed by lord voldemort shirley hendersons first scene in the film bridget joness diary involves her character jude crying in a womens toilets in lego harry potter years  harry and ron battle myrtle hermione and myrtle have a lot in common they are both muggleborn and both hermione and myrtle run to the girls lavatory upon being teased by classmates a move that puts both in mortal danger from a troll and basilisk respectively but while hermione is saved by a repentant ron and harry myrtle is killed by the unfeeling riddle myrtle is similar to hanakosan a japanese legend talking about a girl who haunts school bathrooms at the wizarding world of harry potter moaning myrtle haunts the restrooms though only her voice is heard shirley henderson and kelly macdonald who played another hogwarts ghost the grey lady played sisters in the film intermission apparently she never informed anyone about her death until she told harry ron and lockhart its unknown why she never told armando dippet or albus dumbledore about the cause of her death it is possible that shortly after her death she was too distraught or traumatised to talk about it and was not asked for fear of upsetting her depending on the month she was born in she may have been in the same year as gryffindor rubeus hagrid who was accused of killing her with his acromantula aragog in te film adaptation of harry potter and the goblet of fire myrtle mentioned to harry that she briefly spotted some polyjuice potion in the drains and asked him if he had been doing any more illicit brewing which he denied had harry investigated
