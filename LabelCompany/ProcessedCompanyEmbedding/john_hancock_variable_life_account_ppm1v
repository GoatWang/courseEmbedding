substitution in accordance with section  of the act and rule c thereunder each substitution will be effected by having each subaccount that invests in a replaced fund redeem its shares of the replaced fund at the net asset value calculated on the date of the substitution and purchase shares of the appropriate replacing fund at the net asset value calculated on the same date  john hancock and jhvlico will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including all legal accounting and brokerage expenses relating to the substitutions the belowdescribed disclosure documents and this application no costs will be borne directly or indirectly by contract owners  affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the substitutions and the substitutions will result in no change in their accumulated values under their contracts nor will the rights or the obligations of john hancock or jhvlico under the contracts or the insurance benefits to contract owners be altered in any way the substitutions will not cause the fees and charges under the contracts currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions start printed page   the substitutions requested in this application will be described in supplements to the applicable prospectuses for the contracts filed with the commission or in other supplemental disclosure documents collectively “supplements” and mailed to all affected contract owners each supplement will give the relevant contract owners notice of each substitution that would affect their respective contracts and will describe the reasons for engaging in that substitution the supplements will also inform existing contract owners with values allocated to a subaccount investing in a replaced fund that no additional amounts may be allocated to the subaccounts that invest in that fund on or after the date of substitution  in addition the affected contract owners will have and the supplements will inform them that they have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value prior to a substitution from the subaccount investing in the replaced fund in that substitution or for  days after a substitution from a subaccount investing in the replacing fund in that substitution to one or more subaccounts investing in other funds available under the applicable contract without the reallocation resulting in any transfer charge or limitation counting toward the lifetime cap or diminishing the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given contract year  each affected contract owner will also be provided with a prospectus for each relevant replacing fund which will accompany or precede the supplement discussed above  within five days after a substitution john hancock and jhvlico each will send to its affected contract owners written confirmation that the substitutions have occurred the confirmations will also identify the shares of the replaced portfolios that have been eliminated and the shares of the replacing portfolios that have been substituted that confirmation will reiterate the free transfer rights disclosed in the supplements that such owners will have previously received  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions applicants legal analysis  according to applicants the legislative history makes it clear that the purpose of section c is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer applicants state that section c does this by preventing unscrutinized substitutions which might in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the replacing security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring either a loss of any sales load deducted from their original investment an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption proceeds or both  applicants submit that all of the substitutions will benefit contract owners by moving them to funds with lower overall expenses and equal or better performance record and prospects  applicants also contend that the investment characteristics of each replacing fund are very similar to those of the corresponding replaced fund in this connection applicants point out that the hancock international opportunities fund is somewhat more conservative than the templeton developing fund and that the aim vi premier equity fund is somewhat more conservative than the aim vi growth fund however applicants assert that the hancock international fund should not be considered to be either more or less conservative than the templeton foreign fund  applicants assert that the substitutions will be effected in a manner that has no adverse economic consequences for contract owners in this regard applicants will afford affected contract owners protection against increased expenses and changes under terms described in applicants condition  below  applicants note that contract owners who do not wish to participate in a replacing fund will have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value among other available subaccounts without the imposition of any charge or limitation  the substitution from aim vi growth fund is to the much larger aim vi premier equity fund which according to applicants has potential advantages to contract owners in terms of economies of scale and diversification of portfolio investments applicants acknowledge that the templeton developing fund is larger than the hancock international opportunities fund and that the templeton foreign fund is larger than the hancock international fund which would replace it nevertheless applicants point out that even without any reimbursement arrangement the expense ratio of each replaced fund is higher than that of the corresponding replacing fund  to summarize applicants submit a that the substitutions will benefit the affected contract owners and will not entail any of the abuses against which section c is addressed and b that the approvals applicants request under section c are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants conditions as conditions to the approvals that applicants seek  for each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the  months following the date of substitution into the hancock international fund and the hancock international opportunities fund each of john hancock and jhvlico will adjust the contract values invested in either of such funds as a result of the substitutions to the extent necessary to effectively reimburse the affected owners for their proportionate share of any amount by which the annual rate of the replacing funds total operating expenses after any expense waivers or reimbursements for that fiscal period as a percentage of the funds average daily net assets plus the annual rate of any assetbased charges excluding any such charges that are for premium taxes deducted under the terms of the owners contract for that fiscal period exceed the sum of the annualized rate of the corresponding replaced funds total operating expenses as a percentage of such replaced funds average daily net assets for the twelve months ended december   plus the annual rate of any assetbased charges excluding any such charges that are for premium taxes deducted under that contract for such twelve months  for a period of three years following the date of the substitution of the aim vi premier equity fund for the aim vi growth fund neither john hancock nor jhvlico will receive any direct or indirect benefits from aim vi premier equity fund any investment adviser or underwriter to that fund or any “affiliated person” as that term is in section a of the act of any of them that exceed the rate of any benefits that such insurance company directly or indirectly has been receiving from aim vi growth fund any investment adviser or underwriter to that fund or any affiliated person of any of them for this purpose “benefits” shall be construed to include any investment advisory fees payments pursuant to rule b plans shareholder or other service fees start printed page administrative fees revenue sharing payments or other similar payments in connection with assets subject to the substitution whether such benefits are with
