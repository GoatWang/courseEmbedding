diamond client portal faq what is the difference between netxinvestor and the black diamond client portal the difference is that the black diamond portal will show your account here at bc in a format that closely mirrors our quarterly reports that is to say the portal is much easier to view and understand how your money is invested and also includes historical performance the portal also has a “document vault” where we will upload documents you might need including quarterly reports and this vault can also be used by you to upload documents to us in a nut shell the black diamond portal is more userfriendly and works on all types of devices phones tablets etc the only thing netxinvestor has that the portal does not are the monthly brokerage statements trade confirmations and endofyear
