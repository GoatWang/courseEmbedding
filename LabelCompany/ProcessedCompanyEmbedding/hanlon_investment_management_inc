financial institutions we are pleased to now offer access to this investment approach in a portable mutual fund vehicle that will be available on all of the industry’s leading fund platforms” hanlon’s

benefits of market appreciation by moving back into the markets during periods of market strength “in today’s more volatile market environment advisors and their clients need more sophisticated investment strategies to meet their financial goals and objectives” hanlon said “our tactical overlay approach combined with the academic and private sector research on the benefits of dividends and momentum as notable factors in generating alpha over the long term are part of that approach and our new mutual fund products will provide the industry with broader access to these strategies” to
