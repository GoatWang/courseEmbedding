performer  performance growing up in the pacific northwest leavitt was influenced by the woodcraft and engineering of native american scandinavian and industrial craft in the region his parents practiced education graphic design and environmentalism formulating leavitts early interests in both art and sociology as a child he taught himself to build miniature hydroplanes in balsa wood my mom had some drawing skills she started as a graphic designer at boeing leavitt says i would have her draw my action figures and i would watch her draw he attended the pratt institute in new york in  and completed a selfdesigned bachelor of arts at the evergreen state college in olympia wa in  leavitt began crafting a motley variety of apartment friendly popcultthemed art after dropping out of pratt

confrontations in public in the same period leavitts studio became known as the intuition kitchen artshop in seattle evolving as a selfproduced gallery space his artshop sold his trading cards and first handmade action figures it closed in  as leavitt showed his work in retail galleries since then leavitt has continued noncommercial side projects political activity and community activism  portable homeless sheltersedit mleavitt portable homeless shelters   tent city three small wheeled housing units were built for seattlearea tent cities the first two units made from salvaged pallet wood served these tent cities for  years beginning at the  wto protests in seattle as the homeless faced the threat of street sweeps during wto leavitts creations were used as a honeymoon sweet sic for one couple and as a headquarters for the seattle housing and resource effort share log cabins for the homeless it is an odd invention indeed but it may also be a solutions of sorts for homelessness in seattlereal change a third unit was built in  using vinyl siding scraps salvaged from construction debris though designed for domestic dwelling the units were most often been used for

painted small portraits of famous and lesserknown artists reprinted like traditional baseball trading cards i had so many ideas too many ideas the opposite of writers block says leavitt i started doing trading cards of work i had already done ideas for things i hadnt built and famous people my influences who inspired me artcard subjects were drawn from varied genre similar to his successive art army action figures as described by leavitt the trading cards were the direct precursor to the action figures the trading cards were like singular figures in action why not d why not an action figure a toy printed and sold in limited editions packaged in wrappers with bubble gum art cards were also exhibited as art objects leavitt said its a way i created to compare people and what they do across all kinds of different areas many massproduced trading cards are based on original pieces that are shrunken down to fit the space i take great pride that that is the size i drew them leavitt says its one of the challenges i like its like a game to create art that small and make it work the artists magazine seattlebased independent media advocacy group reclaim the media collaborated with

art army series is more commonly considered fine art these are art toys with a capital a jason atomic pimp magazine leavitt is interested mainly in the figure as sculpture and less as a pure platform dot dot dash die gestalten verlag the toy definition simply describes the figures engineering leavitt says  action figures are ours they are particular to the early s boom in mainstream toy business that predated the antisocial video game boom and i like the connotations of the words action and figure movement and motion and figurative realism the mixed media and wood figures range from  cm to  meter tall and articulate with moving body parts and removable accessories more of a goodnatured joke than a stern commentary on the commodification of art david stoesz seattle weekly the biographic series depicts subjects in an array of genres though most often contemporary visual artists leavitt perceives the potential for his figures to act as bridges between pop culture and art history dot dot dash die gestalten verlag in over  different figures subjects include jeff koons ai weiwei kara walker cindy sherman takashi murakami frida kahlo david byrne björk and tupac shakur the tributes to leavitts heroes will do nothing more than put a big dopy grin on your face seattle magazine when it comes to art icons michael leavitt has a deep set of beliefs about who deserves a reserved parking space in the annals of history juxtapoz magazine leavitt has said i wanted to pay respect to peoples work i love and give them a little taste of their own medicine exploring the concept of an artists body being consumed by their work the enemy of the art army the man included martha stewart britney spears and the john tesh michael bolton kenny g headed monster the project is clearly aligned against the forces of imperialism and cultural suckiness but leavitt makes his points with a light touch being too highspirited and incorrigibly silly to get bogged down in another dreary leftist critique david stoesz seattle weekly leavitt succeeds in art’s most important function — to not only help us recognize and articulate our values but participate in a dialog that validates them as well at its best art connects our best selves with each other and he has done that i’m grateful to artists who address the subject of what is it about fighting and glorifying fighting and power anyway in a way that gets our minds thinking and lips moving polymer clay daily mleavitt barack obama  mixed media with various political action figure projects leavitt has collaborated with the toy company fctry

michael does an incredible job of recreating the colors and logos of these classicsnicekickscom the shoes are to not carry of course but to admire as an art object nunllifestyle by creating cardboard sculptures of some of the most popular models in footwear he is essentially riding the commercial train and exercising his meticulous craft of making these wearable cardboard replicas the demographic that would buy these may not usually buy a piece of art but they would buy this and call it art cyanatrendlandcom leavitt says i might dabble in satire of other essentials in a bad economy eye glasses winter coats food items… but shoes are so intimately linked to our visual culture they’re a necessity that we still get to have fun buying and wearing i’ve always believed that fine art high quality

onscreen characters creative boom leavitt carved the  scale  inch sculptures in wood and finished the carvings with acrylic paint king cuts furthered the central themes in leavitts art of exposing tastemakers behind the scenes and work consuming a creators body the lives of many great film directors are undoubtedly consumed by their work intertwined with the stories characters and settings they seek to convey leavitt said i’m good at sculpting the likeness of a face so it gets interesting when it’s a face maybe you wouldn’t recognize off the bat but you know who it is you know that person’s work it’s the face behind the mask the person behind the camera the wizard behind the curtain  critical responseedit entertainment weekly pokes fun at a piece depicting the television and film
