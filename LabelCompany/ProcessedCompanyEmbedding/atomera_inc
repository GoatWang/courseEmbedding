of this offering towards development engineering which will consist primarily of our further development and qualification of mst® and the evaluation testing and engineering involved in the formal product qualification process undertaken by our potential customers as our marketing and business development efforts lead to a significant indication of interest on the part of a potential customer we will engage in development engineering for purposes of characterizing our solution to the goals and needs of the customer and work with customer to tune our mst® to their unique production process and equipment we intend to apply approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering towards business development marketing and sales in the initial stages of our marketing and business development we expect to spend a significant amount of time and capital in defining the benefits of mst® for each target customer including simulation modeling data collection marketing costs market research partnership development and business development efforts we intend to apply approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering towards research spending including longterm investigation into additional advanced materials and techniques for our platform efforts with our academic and scientific partners and maintenance of our patent portfolio the net proceeds allocated towards working capital will be applied towards our costs of facilities information technology public company related costs including accounting and legal along with normal recurring general and administrative expenses our estimated use of proceeds is based on our current assumptions and estimates concerning the costs and timelines of securing one or more idms or fabless semiconductor manufacturers to qualify and license mst®technology and start fullscale industrial production of a device that incorporates our mst® technology if our assumptions or estimates prove to be inaccurate we may require additional funds in order to carry out the activities described above in addition the expected allocation of net proceeds set forth above represents our best estimates based upon our present plans and our assumptions regarding industry conditions and our anticipated future revenues and expenditures we may find it necessary to reallocate some of the proceeds within the abovedescribed categories or to use portions thereof for other purposes in order to carry out our business plan if those assumptions change if the underwriter exercises its right to purchase additional  shares of common stock to cover overallotments we may receive up to an additional  after deducting  for underwriting discounts we intend to apply any net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option to working capital pending the uses described above we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing securities such as money market accounts certificates of deposit commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the us government our lead product mst® is a proprietary and patent protected performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry we compete with idms oems foundries fabless manufacturers of semiconductors and semiconductor ip licensing companies for the development and commercialization of technologies that improve the performance of semiconductors historically when a new fabrication process proves to be a lowcost improvement to the standard fabrication process and is additive rather than in place of other performance technologies it has been successfully adopted industrywide good examples of such advances have been strained silicon such as sige we believe that mst® has the potential to be one of these lowcost additive technologies in which case mst® would not be subject to significant direct competition from other technologies company description we are engaged in the business of developing commercializing and licensing proprietary processes and technologies for the  billion semiconductor industry our lead technology named mears silicon technology™ or mst® is a thin film of reengineered silicon typically  to  angstroms or approximately  to  silicon atomic unit cells thick mst® can be applied as a transistor channel enhancement to cmostype transistors the most widely used transistor type in the semiconductor industry mst® is our proprietary and patentprotected performance enhancement technology that we believe addresses a number of key engineering challenges facing the semiconductor industry we believe that by incorporating mst® transistors can be smaller with increased speed reliability and energy efficiency in addition since mst® is an additive and low cost technology it can be deployed on an industrial scale with machines commonly used in semiconductor manufacturing we believe that mst® can be widely incorporated into the most common types of semiconductor products including analog logic optical and memory integrated circuits we do not intend to design or manufacture integrated circuits directly instead we intend to develop and license technologies and processes that will offer the designers and manufacturers of integrated circuits a lowcost solution to the industry need for greater performance and lower power consumption in the mids our founder dr robert mears was part of a team that reengineered silica optical fiber to invent the erbiumdoped fiber amplifier or edfa a technology that increased the bandwidth of optical fiber more than  times the invention of edfa helped to revolutionize the development of broadband and to this day remains a key technology in the optical communications industry dr mears anticipated scaling problems for silicon semiconductors and founded atomera incorporated in order to address those problems for the semiconductor industry over the last ten years we have undertaken significant laboratory testing and engaged with a range of semiconductor industry and academic technology leaders to evaluate mst® performance on test chips in industrial fabrication environments we believe this testing has demonstrated that mst®offers performance benefits beyond and in most cases additive to those provided by already successful semiconductor performance enhancement technologies such as dual stress liners and sourcedrain channel stressors such as esigeesic and can be implemented without significant additional cost or significant modification to the current semiconductor fabrication process we are now in the process of transitioning mst® technology toward commercial adoption we are currently in the early stages of process qualification with leading integrated device manufacturers or idms and foundries the idms and foundries are our intended customers and by way of the process qualification stage they test and evaluate the potential incorporation of our mst® technology into the integrated circuits they produce we are also partnering with manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication equipment and developers of modeling tools these parties are part of a semiconductor infrastructure supporting the industry with manufacturing capital equipment for transistor production and transistor process modeling software and we are in discussions with certain equipment manufacturers and tool developers concerning their incorporation of our mst® technology into the equipment and tools they offer to the industry assuming the timely and successful completion of process and subsequent product qualification by customers and partners we expect mst®enabled product revenue in
