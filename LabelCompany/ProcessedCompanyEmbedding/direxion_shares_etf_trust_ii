described in item  in the annual report on form k the direxion shares etf trust ii the trust was organized as a delaware statutory trust on july   and is currently organized into twelve separate series each a fund and collectively the funds direxion daily gold bull x shares direxion daily gold bear x shares direxion daily silver bull x shares direxion daily silver bear x shares direxion daily japanese yen bull x shares direxion daily japanese yen bear x shares direxion daily dollar bull x shares direxion daily dollar bear x shares direxion daily euro bull x shares direxion daily euro bear x shares direxion daily gold bear x shares and direxion daily silver bear x shares each series of the trust listed above issues common units of beneficial interest which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of that respective fund shares direxion asset management llc the sponsor serves as the trusts commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the us commodity futures trading commission cftc and is a member of the national futures association nfa wilmington trust company serves as the trustee of the trust the trustee the funds are commodity pools as defined under the commodity exchange act the cea and the applicable regulations of the cftc are operated by the sponsor the trust is not an investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended each fund seeks to provide daily leveraged investment results before fees and expenses which correspond to the performance of a particular index commodity or currency on a given day groups of funds are collectively referred to in the annual report on report k in several different ways the funds with the word bull in their name attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results before fees and expenses that correlate positively to the return of an index or benchmark the funds with the word bear in their name attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results that correlate negatively to the return of an index or benchmark the bull x funds attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results before fees and expenses that correlate positively to three times  the daily return of its target benchmark the bear x funds attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results before fees and expenses that correlate to three times the inverse  of the daily return of its target benchmark the bear x funds attempt to provide daily investment results before fees and expenses that correlate negatively to the return of an index or benchmark these bear funds seek  of the returns of their benchmark indices none of the funds seek to achieve their stated objective over a period greater than one day each fund intends to obtain exposure to its benchmark by taking long or short positions in futures contracts on its underlying commodity or currency as applicable in the event position accountability rules or position limits are reached with respect to the futures contracts the sponsor may in its commercially reasonable judgment cause the effected fund to obtain exposure to its benchmark through cashsettled exchangedtraded swaps and other overthecounter transactions that are based on the price of the futures contracts financial instruments if such instruments tend to exhibit trading prices or returns that correlate with the related futures contract and will further the investment objective of such fund each fund seeks investment results for a single day only not for longer periods a single day is measured from the time a fund calculates its respective net asset value per share to the time of the funds next nav calculation this is different from most exchangetraded funds and means that the return of such fund for a period longer than a single trading day will be the result of each days returns compounded over the period which will very likely differ from  time  times or  times of the return of the index to which such fund is benchmarked for that period in periods of higher market volatility the volatility of the benchmark may be at least as important to a funds return for the period as the return of the benchmark these funds are riskier than table of contents similarly benchmarked exchangetraded funds that are not leveraged or inversed accordingly these funds may not be suitable for all investors and should be used only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged inverse or inverse leveraged investment results shareholders who invest in the funds should actively manage and monitor their investments as frequently as daily each fund continuously offers and redeems its shares in blocks of  shares only authorized participants may purchase and redeem shares from a fund and then only in creation units an authorized participant is an entity that has entered into an authorized participant agreement with one or more of the funds shares of the funds are offered to authorized participants in creation units at each funds respective nav authorized participants may then offer to the public from time to time shares from any creation unit they create at a pershare market price that varies depending on among other factors the trading price of the shares of each fund on the nyse arca the nav and the supply of and demand for the shares at the time of the offer shares from the same creation unit may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors the form of authorized participant agreement and related authorized participant handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an authorized participant may purchase or redeem a creation unit authorized participants do not receive from any fund the sponsor or any of their affiliates any underwriting fees or compensation in connection with their sale of shares to the public liquidity and capital resources a significant portion of the nav of each fund is likely to be held in cash andor us treasury securities or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or similar securities as described above a portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements andor used as margin for each funds trading in futures margin requirements in respect of swap agreements are the subject of pending rule proposals issued by the cftc and the us bank regulators it is possible that increased margin will apply to swap agreements upon adoption of the new requirements by these regulators the percentage that us treasury bills and other shortterm fixedincome securities will bear to the total net assets of each fund will vary from period to period as the market values of the underlying swaps futures contracts and forward contracts change during the period ended june   each of the funds earned interest income as follows interest income period ended june   direxion daily gold bull x shares   direxion daily gold bear x shares   funds commenced investment operations on april   each funds underlying futures and swaps as the case may be will be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions regulatory considerations and other reasons for example swaps are not presently traded on an exchange do not have uniform terms and conditions and in general are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty additionally at the present time most swaps are not centrally cleared and vary in terms of standardization which may further contribute to their lack of liquidity in the case of futures contracts commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily limits during a single day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit such positions can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures contract prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading such market conditions could prevent a fund from promptly liquidating its futures positions entry into noncleared swap agreements or forward contracts will further impact liquidity because these contractual agreements are executed on a principaltoprincipal basis between private parties and therefore the time required to offset or unwind these positions may be greater than that for cleared andor exchangetraded instruments this potential delay could be exacerbated to the extent a counterparty is not a united states person table of contents the large size of the positions in which a fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making their positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the funds will typically invest in financial investments related to one benchmark which in many cases is highly concentrated because each fund will enter trade futures and may enter into swap agreements its capital will be at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts market risk or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts credit risk credit risk is greater for noncleared swaps than for futures or cleared swaps market risk trading in futures contracts will involve each fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a commodity underlying a funds benchmark at a specified date and price should it hold such futures contract into the deliverable period should a fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity it would be required to make delivery of that commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash since the repurchase price to which the value of a commodity can rise is unlimited entering into commitments to sell commodities would expose a fund to theoretically unlimited risk each funds exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors including the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held the inherent uncertainty of each funds trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors capital for more information see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form k credit risk when a fund enters into futures contracts swap agreements or forward contract the fund will be exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations the counterparty for futures contracts traded on exchanges is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange in general clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and as such should significantly reduce this credit risk in cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions certain swap and forward agreements are contracted for directly with counterparties there can be no assurance that any counterparty clearing member or clearing house will meet its obligations to a fund forward agreements do not involve the delivery of assets at the onset of a transaction but may be settled physically in the underlying asset if such contracts are held to expiration particularly in the case of currency forwards thus prior to settlement if the counterparty to a forward contract defaults a funds risk of loss will generally consist of the net amount of payments that the fund is contractually entitled to receive if any however if physically settled forwards are held until expiration presently there is no plan to do this at the time of settlement a fund may be at risk for the full notional value of the forward contracts depending on the type of settlement procedures used swap agreements do not generally involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets either at the outset of a transaction or upon settlement accordingly if the counterparty to a swap agreement defaults the funds risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the fund is contractually entitled to receive if any table of contents the sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties as determined by the sponsor limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the funds not posting margin directly with a counterparty limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the fcm and ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for the fcm for each fund in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts will be required by cftc regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the fund all assets of the fund relating to domestic futures trading and the fcm will not be allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the fcm on november   the cftc proposed new regulations that would require enhanced customer protections risk management programs internal monitoring and controls capital and liquidity standards customer disclosures and auditing and examination programs for fcms the proposed rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the fcms with which they may choose to do business fcms are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner the capital and liquidity of fcms are strengthened to safeguard their continued operations and the auditing and examination programs of the cftc and the selfregulatory organizations sros are monitoring the activities of fcms in a thorough manner the final regulations have not yet been adopted offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of june   the funds have not utilized nor do they expect to utilize in the future special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements and have no loan guarantee arrangements or off balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the funds while each funds exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on a funds financial position each funds contractual obligations are with the sponsor certain service providers and with any counterparty to a financial instrument management fee payments made to the sponsor are calculated as a fixed percentage of each funds nav as such the sponsor cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as navs are not known until a future date historical expenses are shown in the statement of income and expenses the agreement with the sponsor may be terminated by either party upon  days written notice to the other party critical accounting policies preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates the sponsors application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used each fund expects to have significant exposure to financial instruments the funds hold a significant portion of their assets in futures swaps or forward contracts all of which are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial statements with changes in fair value reported in the statement of income and expenses assets of each fund not invested in financial instruments will be invested in cash andor us treasury securities or other high credit quality shortterm fixedincome or table of contents similar securities such as shares of money market funds bank deposits bank money market accounts certain variable ratedemand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities whether denominated in us or the applicable foreign currency with respect to a currency fund or other interestbearing securities approved by the cftc for investment of customer funds each of which will be held at fair value the use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the trusts and the funds financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price for financial reporting purposes the gold silver yen and euro funds value transactions based upon the daily last sale price value occurring on or before  pm et of a standard futures contract for the current active month published by the cme on or before  shortterm investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value for daily nav purposes for financial reporting purposes shortterm investments are valued at their market price using information provided by a thirdparty pricing service or market quotations derivatives eg futures swaps and forward agreements are generally valued using independent sources andor agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined by the sponsor futures contracts except for those entered into by the gold silver yen euro and dollar funds are generally valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades for financial reporting purposes all futures contracts are valued at last settled price if there was no sale on that day and for nonexchangetraded derivatives the sponsor may in its sole discretion choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market value of such position for such day such fair value prices would be generally determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards when market closing prices are not available the sponsor may fair value an asset of a fund pursuant to the policies the sponsor has adopted which are consistent with normal industry standards the funds disclose the fair value of their investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value see note  in the financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information discounts on shortterm securities purchased are amortized and reflected as interest income in the statement of income and expenses realized gains losses and changes in unrealized gain loss on open positions are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the statement of income and expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur respectively each fund pays its respective brokerage commissions including applicable exchange fees nfa fees giveup fees pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities for each funds investment in us commodity futures trading commission regulated investments brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a halfturn basis section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period provided in section ab of the  act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies the trust has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period the trust and the funds financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards table of contents results of operations for the period ended june

levels are at alltime highs and what this means for your investment decisions going forward but first a few comments about last week i recently returned from the oxford club’s private wealth seminar held at the historic grand hotel on michigan’s mackinac island the hotel which some of you might remember as the setting for the  film “somewhere in time” starring christopher reeve and jane seymour took a mere  days to build in the s—impossible by today’s standards especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at  feet while there i had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts including alex green the oxford club’s chief investment strategist you might have read some of his wonderful work for investment u the group’s educational arm alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between democrats and republicans in his view is that democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions while republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions i prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics but alex has a point i’m convinced that donald trump a republican won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both whitecollar and bluecollar americans who felt as if the us economy was no longer working for them us corporate taxes are among the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas and outofcontrol regulations threaten to strangle business growth but just as green insinuated the trump administration has enacted or has hinted at enacting policies that rankle americans of all political stripes precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties take attorney general jeff sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals the operative word here is “suspected” many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials it could in fact violate the fourth amendment which of course protects americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures” this is just one among numerous policymaking decisions that have members of both political parties as well as independents scratching their heads trump was elected to reform taxes slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly it’s unclear how privateasset seizures fit into that picture if this administration resolved to stay on message and on course and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday americans it might receive greater support from those who voted for trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t us dollar in bear market a boon for gold since the start of the year the fiveyear treasury yield adjusted for inflation has risen about  percent normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period the us dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market because gold is priced in dollars this has been supportive for prices yeartodate the yellow metal is up more than  percent as i said the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far but it slumped to a month low against the euro last week following european central bank ecb president mario draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the european union eu until at least the end of the year “we need to be persistent and patient and prudent because we’re not there yet” draghi said referring to the fact that eu inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis indeed the june purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging european markets were all above the key  mark for the first time in recent memory ubs we’re still constructive on gold that gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging” that’s one of the key takeaways from a ubs note last week in which the swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal investor demand this year has been slower than expected but ubs analyst joni teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in india this summer could help push consumption in the world’s secondlargest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year with india having imported a phenomenal  metric tons in the first half of  alone teves writes that “we expect gold demand in india this year to be around historic averages” which would be very supportive for prices etps attracted a record  billion in the first half of  like gold in india exchangetraded products etps also had a knockout first half as deutsche bank reports etps attracted a record

record amount following ’s  billion we could see etp inflows climb as high as  billion by the end of this year deutsche estimates of course runaway demand for etps and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold having said that though bullionvault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record  metric tons as of the beginning of july that’s enough gold to make more than  million carat wedding rings bullionvault says or to supply the microchips for  billion iphones the site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices following three months of “light liquidation” global debt on alert all of what i’ve said so far pertains to the nearterm gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentioned in a note last week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they continue forever plus nearzero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place you can probably tell where i’m headed with all of this another crisis could be in the works savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen according to seabridge gold i always recommend a  percent weighting in gold— percent in bars and coins  percent in gold stocks

gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentioned in a note last week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they continue forever plus nearzero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place you can probably tell where i’m headed with all of this another crisis could be in the works savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen according to seabridge gold i always recommend a  percent weighting in gold— percent in bars and coins  percent in
