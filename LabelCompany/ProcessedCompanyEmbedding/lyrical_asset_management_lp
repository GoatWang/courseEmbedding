intrinsic value should create a margin of safety and allow for uncommon return generation we believe that the greater the discount the greater the potential for investment return while attractive valuation is the most important thing it is not the only thing we require in an investment we will only invest in quality companies we seek businesses that we believe will generate attractive returns on their invested capital we seek resilient businesses those with reasonable debt levels positive growth attractive margins competent management and the flexibility to react to all phases of the business cycle our quality discipline leads us to avoid deeply cyclical companies basic materials and commodities and regulated utilities we will only invest in companies we can thoroughly analyze and understand certain businesses do not lend themselves to fundamental analysis either because of complexity or opacity examples include banks pharmaceuticals biotech and high tech we avoid such
