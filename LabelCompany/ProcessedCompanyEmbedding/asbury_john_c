political fame scott became the president of the citizens republican club as the vare machine attempted to gain the black vote in philadelphia scott using his influence as a leader within the citizens republican club became a spokesperson and leader for the africanamerican community in philadelphia the ideal job for scott seemed to be the city magistrate a position typically rewarded by the party for longstanding service and due to scott’s relationship with the vares they placed him on the republican ticket in  however scott’s name was dropped from the republican primary ballot several days before the primary election spurring the loss of  to  black votes in the end j hampton moore won the election for mayor over the vare supported candidate judge john m patterson on november   thanks to
