applications covers topics foundational to understanding spin waves such as the physics of magnetism and electromagnetic waves in anisotropic media as well as both classical and quantum mechanical treatments of spin wave excitations the authors discuss many applications including microwave delay lines spin waveoptical devices and microwave oscillations induced by spin transfer torques in multilayer structures the material provides explanations and developments of concepts that assist students and researchers interested in beginning work on topics related to magnetic excitations the book can be divided into three major parts the first is comprised of chapters  and is concerned with the physics of magnetism and electromagnetic waves in magnetic media the second part chapters  focuses on magnetostatic modes and dipolar spin waves their properties how to excite them and how they interact with light finally chapters  and  treat nonlinear phenomena and advanced applications of spin wave excitations spin waves theory and applications provides an introduction to an active area of research and a handy reference for workers in the field the material is useful for graduate students in physics materials science or electrical engineering as well as active researchers in fundamental and applied magnetism show all reviews from the reviews“the book is a textbook on spin waves it comprises  chapters plus some mathematical appendices which deal respectively with the physics of magnetism in magnetic insulators …  the mathematical prerequisite is standard and the book is quite suitable for graduate students” guy jumarie zentralblatt math vol  “the present text is … based on a fully quantummechanical treatment includes extensive discussions of nonlinear interactions and solitonic excitations and of course incorporates current applications within  pages a careful reader has the opportunity to gain an impressive range of knowledge and understanding of spin waves from the quantummechanical origins of macroscopic magnetism … to the experimental tools to probe their properties and intriguing modern technological applications … each chapter contains several

key idea of the book is that scientific and practical advances can be obtained if researchers working in traditions that have been assumed to be mutually incompatible make a real effort to engage in dialogue with each other comparing and contrasting their understandings of a given phenomenon and how these different understandings can either complement or mutually elaborate on each other this key idea applies to many fields particularly in the social and behavioral sciences as well as education and computer science the book shows how we have achieved this by presenting our study of collaborative learning during the course of a fouryear project through a series of five workshops involving dozens of researchers the  editors and authors involved in this project studied and reported on collaborative learning technology enhanced learning and cooperative work the authors share an interest in understanding group interactions but approach this topic from a variety of traditional disciplinary homes and theoretical and methodological traditions this allows the book to be of use to researchers in many different fields and with many different goals and agendas show all about the
