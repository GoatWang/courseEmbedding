defer all capital gain taxes a  exchanger must meet four  exchange requirements   exchange requirement the investor must reinvest a  of sale proceeds if a  exchanger does not reinvest all proceeds from the sale of the relinquished property the balance received is considered cash boot and the investor will have to pay capital gains taxes on that amount   exchange requirement the investor must acquire property with the same or greater debt if a  exchanger does not acquire a replacement property with an equal or greater amount of debt he or she is relieved of a debt obligation and this is called a mortgage boot the irs considers this reduction in debt a benefit to the  exchanger therefore it is taxable unless it is offset by adding equivalent cash to the replacement property purchase   exchange requirement the investor must use a “qualified  intermediary” also known as a “ facilitator” or “ accommodator” to hold the funds from the first sale until purchase of the new property is closed the “qualified  intermediary” qi acts as the “middleman” in the  exchange providing the paperwork oversight escrow services and expertise necessary to ensure that the transaction legally qualifies as a  exchange under section  of the internal revenue code even though a  exchange is a complicated process a  exchange using a good qi can become a simple transaction and look surprisingly like a standard sale   exchange requirement the new investment must be in “likekind” property irs  exchange rules require the  exchange of likekind relinquished property for other likekind replacement property this doesn’t mean though that  exchanged properties must be of the exact nature as the relinquished property bare land doesn’t have to be exchanged for bare land or income property exchanged for another income property any real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business can be exchanged in a  exchange for any other real property held for investment or real property used in a trade or business get  list what is a qualified  intermediary a qualified intermediary is an independent agent that facilitates a  exchange the taxpayer’s attorney or accountant cannot be a qualified intermediary most intermediaries are affiliated with banks trust companies or title companies using a qualified intermediary is one way of “safe harboring” a  exchange essentially the qualified intermediary takes an assignment of rights in the sale contract for the old property and the purchase contract for the new property these are simple documents that the attorney fills out along with a basic exchange agreement with the intermediary through these three documents the intermediary is brought into the  exchange and subject to compliance with the timing rules discussed below the transaction can qualify as a  exchange rather than a taxable sale ensure your  exchange facilitator is fully qualified       meets the safe harbor requirements of a qualified
