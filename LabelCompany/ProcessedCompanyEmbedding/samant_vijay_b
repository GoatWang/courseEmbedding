and ceo vical incorporatedjul  about vical incorporated vicl theodore cohen long only biotech healthcare midcaptheodore cohen novelswhen venture capitalists seek candidates for startups in which to invest money some of their major concerns as they weigh the many opportunities before them are quality management a competitive or innovative advantage and industry growth for companies of interest importantly these are much the same concerns that should be on the minds of investors as they review potential investments from among the thousands available today on the worlds stock exchanges as readers know one of the companies about which i have been writing on seeking alpha since april  is vical incorporated nasdaqvicl of san diego ca you can find my latest three articles here here and here selling for around  per share the company focuses on vaccines and gene therapies given that we now are approaching a critical time in vicals life cycle  that is the anticipated release of data from the pivotal phase  trial of its lead drug allovectin®i thought this would be a good time to learn a little more about vicals management in general and its president and chief executive officer ceo in particular so i asked vijay samant if he would take a few minutes out of his busy schedule for an interview he readily agreed vijay b samant joined vical as president and chief executive officer in november  he previously had  years of diverse us and international sales marketing operations and business development experience with merck from  to mid mr samant was chief operating officer of the merck vaccine division from  to  he served in the merck manufacturing division as vice president of vaccine operations vice president of business affairs and executive director of materials management mr samant earned a masters degree in management studies from the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology in  he received a masters degree in

member of the board of trustees for the international vaccine institute ivi seoul korea since  a member of the board of trustees for the national foundation for infectious diseases nfid bethesda md since  and a director of the aeras global tb vaccine foundation rockville md from  to  cohen thanks mr samant for taking the time from your busy schedule to answer a few questions today samant my pleasure ted and please call me vijay let me say first that my comments today will essentially repeat material presented previously in public presentations to the investment community such as the one i recently gave at the jmp securities healthcare conference any forwardlooking statements including financial expectations and projections of progress in our research and clinical development programs are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected including the risks set forth in our annual report on form k and quarterly reports on form q filed with the securities and exchange commission sec the company has no intent or obligation to update these statements news releases and information on corporate events and presentations are available on the corporate web site cohen cohen thanks vijay i know one thing on everybodys mind when they think of vical is the status of the pivotal phase  trial for your lead drug for metastatic melanoma known as allovectin are you still looking to complete adjudication of the data in the next few months and announce results for both endpoints at the same time in late  samant thats right ted our primary endpoint is objective response rate at  weeks or more after randomization which is a measure of meaningful longterm tumor shrinkage we have a formal adjudication process in place for this endpoint which i described in detail in our last earnings call so i wont repeat that information today that adjudication is going on right now and should be finished by the fourth quarter around that same time we expect to reach the target number of death events for our secondary endpoint overall survival we plan to unblind the data and announce the results for both endpoints at the same time late this year this is of course only an estimate and timing could change based on the event rate cohen if i recall correctly you recently announced new results for the subset of patients in your phase  study is that correct samant yes it is weve been doing a bit of data analysis looking at results from past allovectin trials to help support our expectations for phase  as we have reported in the past more than  of the patients in our highdose phase  trial received one cycle or less of allovectin most because of progressive disease under standard recist criteria because allovectin typically takes at least two cycles to work we thought the subset of patients who got one cycle or less of allovectin might be a good comparator in terms of survival to patients getting treated with chemotherapy in the control arm in phase  we found the median survival for this subset which included a balanced mix of stage iii and stage iv disease was about  months we believe this result supports our previous expectations cohen have your analyses turned up any additional insights from prior studies samant you may remember our early lowdose  microgram allovectin phase  trial comparing dtic alone vs dtic plus allovectin that trial did not show a statistical difference in survival between the two arms as a reminder our current phase  trial uses a fold higher dose of allovectin but we thought the lowdose trial could provide some insights for the control arm in our current study we looked at patients in the lowdose trial who had normal levels of ldh which is an entry requirement in our current phase  trial i should note that less than  of these patients had stage iii disease while the mix in our current phase  trial is expected to be evenly balanced between stage iii and stage iv whether we looked at the normal ldh patients in the lowdose trial treatment arm in the control arm or in both arms together the median survival was about  months we believe these results also are in line with our expectations cohen you of course had a safety monitoring board monitoring the phase  trial if the results of the phase  trial were so good and postulating that similar results might be seen in the phase  study wouldnt you think that at some point the board would have stopped your current trial and put all patients in the control group on allovectin this was done recently for example by the data and safety monitoring board for jjs nysejnj pivotal phase  trial for zytiga in the prechemo indication when the trial achieved statistical significance on one primary end point progression free survival or pfs but not the other overall survival or os samant let me clarify a key point here ted that unlike the jj trial and many others our phase  trial had a safety monitoring board smb not a data and safety monitoring board dsmb the safety monitoring board looked only at safety data not at efficacy im happy to say that we completed five safety reviews and the board recommended continuation of the trial after each review our phase  trial was designed with no interim analyses for efficacy to keep it as small and costeffective as possible because there were no interim looks at efficacy there would be no basis to allow crossovers from the control group to the treatment group the lack of crossovers also prevents compromise of the survival data bottom line  we need to wait for the data to mature and unblind only at the end of the study cohen you have licensed allovectin to anges mg in asia where they are interested in the treatment primarily for use in head and neck cancer could you tell us a little about the terms of the partnership and how its worked out samant the collaboration with anges has been extremely positive and they have been a terrific partner on both the allovectin program and their independently developed collategene® angiogenesis program for treatment of peripheral arterial disease their financial support paid for the majority of our phase  trial we have established a great working relationship and manage the program under the oversight of a joint steering committee with representatives from both companies if allovectin is successful anges will have commercialization rights in the asian territory which excludes australia new zealand and india and we will receive low doubledigit royalties cohen but other than asia vical has retained rights to commercialize allovectin in north america europe and other regions correct samant thats right ted we have retained rights for the rest of the world outside the defined asian territory ideally we would like to commercialize allovectin in the united states and find a partner to help with commercialization in europe and other regions cohen we recently witnessed the launch of another immunotherapeutic product for cancer  dendreons nasdaqdndn provenge  that was marked by a number of missteps to put it lightly even though that launch ranks in the top  of oncology products there are significant takeaways from dendreons experience im sure have not escaped notice for example how are you going to handle the transition of what basically has been a research and development corporation into a productdriven operation put another way is there anything you can say at this time about the corporations preparations for launching your product in terms of restructuring the corporation marketing secondary offerings and so forth samant well we certainly try to learn as much as we can from those who have gone before us dendreon has done many things very well from the release of its pivotal data through the advisory committee and regulatory approval and on to product launch our current efforts are focused on preparations for the path forward including our manufacturing facility our product configuration our clinical and regulatory package and our commercial considerations we have a strong team driving these efforts at vical and as needed we bring in outside help such as consulting firms and scientific advisors once we have the phase  data we will accelerate the process and add appropriate staff when the time is right cohen i know you have a number of other products under development and in the clinic but frankly the one that excites me the mostand the one that seems to elicit the most comments from my readers is your work in the area of the herpes simplex virus  or hsv to be exact i am constantly getting questions via formal comments beneath my articles as well as private messages via seeking alpha asking when the clinical trial will begin and how patients can enroll in the trial can you talk a little about this disease and your development program samant were very excited by the results we got in our mouse and guinea pig testing of the hsv vaccine and are working now on preparations for the initial human testing herpes simplex type  is a major health problem with one out of every four people worldwide being infected there are antiviral treatments available but  of infected individuals are asymptomatic and typically do not get treated even among those who suffer periodic outbreaks of genital lesions the vast majority do not comply with the rigorous daily treatment regimen that is required to control the disease and even those who do follow the treatment regimen can continue to shed virus and transmit it to others a vaccine that would provide lasting immunity could significantly reduce the spread of the hsv virus we expect to start our phase  trial in  and well announce trial details when it begins cohen another program you have in the clinic is your transvax™ therapeutic vaccine for cytomegalovirus cmv here you are teamed with astellas pharma which has exclusive worldwide royaltybearing license to develop and commercialize the product the last i heard you and astellas were expecting to begin a multinational phase  registration trial of transvax in hematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct recipients in the second half of  as well as a phase  trial in solid organ transplant sot recipients shortly thereafter can you give us an update samant ill tell you ted we have found the ideal partner for the transvax program in astellas their extensive knowledge of the transplant market combined with our expertise in vaccines provides true synergy financially this partnership is a winwin for vical since astellas is covering all program costs moving forward and paying us substantial milestones as the program progresses as well as low doubledigit royalties a lot has happened since we entered into this agreement including transition of program leadership and transfer of the ind to astellas clarity in guidance about trial endpoints from the fda and excellent progress toward completion of trial design details astellas has advised us that they expect to start the phase  trial by year end and the phase  as soon as possible after that cohen i dont want to take too much more of your time vijay but of all the other programs you have under development which one not mentioned above has yet to catch fire in wall streets mind  that is which one is the sleeper in your pipeline samant weve been talking about our vaxfectin® adjuvant for several years now ted but investors havent placed any value on it because we have not yet established its value through a license agreement having said that we have been working with a number of potential licensees who are evaluating vaxfectin with their own product candidates and expanding its use through our independent programs for influenza cmv and hsv as well as our collaborative programs for malaria and dengue but vaxfectin is not really the sleeper in our pipeline id have to assign that status to our infectious disease vaccine platform because success with any one program should have a notable impact on credibility for the rest whether this comes first from one of our independent programs like hsv or cymvectin™ or through one of our government collaborations on programs like hiv dengue or malaria the broad scope of applications should serve to multiply the effect of the initial achievement cohen thanks vijay i sincerely appreciate your taking a little time to talk with me today i know my readers will find what you had to say interesting and we wish you well in all of your endeavors samant thats very kind of you ted we appreciate your interest in vical and your efforts to explain our programs to a broad section of the investment community technical analysis as of the close monday june  the daily chart courtesy stockchartcom shows the stock touching the day and closing just above it at  the relative strength is descending and macd is negative if the stock breaks support at  i would expect it to test the day
