fencedeerliquidproductsgardendamageproductrabbitsplantsresistant deer resistant products we have tried that work an article by julia stewart with  words and  views are you frustrated with deer defoliating your prized plants overnight are you ready to learn about some products that others have used that really do work  this summer we have tested some products that our local garden center and some catalogs offered to see which deer resistant products worked and which ones didnt the following are the deer deterrents that we tried and the results the first product we used was liquid fence this is a natural deer and rabbit repellent it is true what the cover states it really works clark kaskie  the inventor of liquid fence developed this product out of frustration of having his plants eaten by all types of critters after trying many different kinds of homemade remedies and expensive over the counter products he decided to make his own repellent being a chemical engineer for over  years gave him a good idea of where to start he knew he wanted it to be both environmentally safe and safe for the animals after a few years of experimenting he came up with this solution his friends and wife tried it and told him that it worked just like a liquid fence so thats what he named it all you do is spray the liquid liberally onto plants and their perimeter during a dry period repeat the process  week later and then approximately once per month thereafter if areas where feeding pressure from deer and rabbits is intense he suggests spraying it once a week for  weeks and then about once per month after that you are really training the deer and rabbits to stay away we found that this product smells pretty bad when you first apply it but it really does work we had some coneflowers that the rabbits where nipping at the stems after applying this as directed the nibbling stopped we also had success with using it on our hibiscus trees and other annuals perennials as well as our gourds the second product we tested was the wireless deer fence it works like a baited electric fence but without the wires instead it contains individual posts  inches tall and weighing  ounces that are positioned around plants that deer like and on deer paths into your yard or garden the deer in your yard are attracted by a sweet smell to touch a post then the post will deliver a harmless shock which frightens them from the area it is recommended to use this product along with a deer resistant spray while you are training the deer the idea is to put the post between  and  feet apart where the deer will find them the distance varies widely depending on terrain existing barriers landscaping etc we used this product mainly to keep the deer away from my new pinkywinkie hydrangeas we still had a little damage while the deer were being trained but i hadnt used a deer detterent spray on them at the time the directions suggest this just while you are training the deer with this product it helps to read all of the directions i liked the wireless deer fence my pinkywinkies still havent been eaten it gives an added protection to using the liquid fence we tested these products in our  acre garden with a variety of deer resistant perennials such as coneflowers grasses and hellebores plant as many of these types of plants as possible that is your first tactic when gardening with deer for more information on plants that deer dont like visit httpwwwflowersplantsgardeningadvicecomdeerresistantplants even after you have planted several deer proof plants you will still need to protect your other vegetation with some type of product as reported in the book deerproofing your yard and garden by rhonda hart if you take a look at state agricultural reports you will see that deer do millions of dollars of damage each year its not surprising when you realize that one acre of a healthy environment can support  deer per square mile these deer can consume  to  pounds of greenery per day this equates to about half a ton of plants over the growing season so there goes your yard with liquid fence and the wireless deer fence along with planting deer resistant plants you can at least learn to coexist with the deer and make the damage minimal both of these products have a money back guarantee rate this article rate   votes  julia is a master gardener floral designer and garden crafter
