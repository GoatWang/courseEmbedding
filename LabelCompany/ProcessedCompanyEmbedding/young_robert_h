by dr robert and shelley young testimonials the new biology made sense however i declared i am not going to give up my coffee red meat and beer i was in for a surprise on march   i began to take control of my health the amazing changes that occurred with my body and my health have changed my life and my attitude about health and nutrition i began drinking  liters of greens per day after just  liters of the greens on the first day my body began to crave the greens my body knew that the greens were good for me products along with a new way of eating have changed my lifepam schultewagner homestead iowasearching for health the last  years has been like an archeological dig finding a this or a that only to discover they were uselessin  weeks i have lost  pounds of my  lb target amount but of the highest importance is the fact i can feel health seeping back inside once again i have at last found my jewel beyond all pricea great shock was to find my singing voice starting to come back after  years of missing in action and then noticing the age spots on my hands were actually getting lighter elaine boylston our bodies were designed to be healthy slender and energetic we were intended to have smooth supple skin and a quick alert mind instead we are overweight tired and sluggish whyan alkaline diet based on the new biology® dr robert o youngs new biology® most simply stated is that the overacidification of the body is the single underlying cause of all disease in contrast the old biology based on the work of louis pasteur in the late s stems from the idea that disease comes from germs which invade the body from the outside dr young has found that when the body is in healthy alkaline balance germs are unable to get a foothold think of your body as a fish tankthink of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the internal fluids of the body that we swim in daily imagine the fish in this tank are your cells and organ systems bathed in fluids which transport food and remove wastes now imagine we back up a car and put the tailpipe up against the air intake filter that supplies the oxygen for the water in the tank instead of a quality water machine the water becomes filled with carbon monoxide lowering the alkaline ph creating an acidic ph environment and threatening the health of the fish your cells and organs what if we throw in too much food or the wrong kind of food acidproducing food like dairy sugar and animal protein and the fish are unable to consume or digest it all and it starts to decompose and putrefy toxic acid waste and chemicals build up as the food breaks down creating more acidic byproducts altering the optimum alkaline ph of the water basically this is a small example of what we may be doing to our internal fluids every day we are fouling them with pollution smoking drugs excessive intake of food overconsumption of acidforming foods and any number of transgressions which compromise the delicate balance of our internal alkaline fluids some of us have fish tanks bodies that are barely able to support life yet we somehow manage to struggle from day to day building more sever imbalances until there is the inevitable crash and debilitating chronic disturbing and disorganizing symptoms to deal withthe ph level the acidalkaline measurement of our internal fluids affects every cell in our bodies extended acid imbalances of any kind are not well tolerated by the body indeed the entire metabolic process depends on a balanced internal alkaline environment a chronically overacidic ph corrodes body tissue slowly eating into the  miles of veins and arteries like acid eating into marble if left unchecked it will interrupt all cellular activities and functions from the beating of your heart to the neural firing of your brain in summary overacidification interferes with life itself leading to all sickness and disease how do you know if youre overly acidicfat is an acid problem so drink your greensperhaps one of dr youngs most well known discoveries is his theory of the cause of obesity—the overweight he has shown that fat is actually an overacidification problem what does that mean the body creates fat cells to carry acids away from your vital organs so these acids literally dont choke your organs to death fat is saving your life fat is actually a response from the body to an alarming overacidic condition so how do you lose weight alkalize and exercise beginning with the health and diet plan outlined in the ph miracle by enjoying an organic greens drink product that is loaded with chlorophyll like doc broc power plants and by drinking purified alkaline water from one of the quality water ionizers we offer such as the chanson miracle water ionizeralkaline diet—water and food—to maintain a healthy weightat the other end of the health spectrum the yeast and fungus produced within an overly acidic body can feed on your nutrients and reduce the chemical and mechanical absorption of everything you eat by as much as  this causes many people to become excessively thin which is no healthier than becoming overweight without protein your body cannot rebuild new tissues or produce enzymes hormones or hundreds of other chemical components necessary for cell energy and organ activity fatigue illness and body weight changes are the results when an underweight person begins to follow the alkaline health and diet lifestyle they may initially loose a little more weight as their body chemistry stabilizes but as their body normalizes they will begin to gain towards their ideal weight healthy bodies are not overweight or underweight a healthy body naturally maintains its own ideal weight you can begin to restore health balance and harmony to your body with ph miracle brand nutritional supplements as alkalizing and oxygenation begins to take place the body naturally begins to seek its own ideal weight allergies signify overacidificationthe toxins produced within an overly acidic oxygen deprived body may contribute significantly to what are often called the symptoms of allergy in addition the absorption of undigested proteins is a major cause of allergy conditions the digestive system is weakened which prevents the total breakdown of amino acids—often causing food allergies this alone may produce a wide spectrum of severe allergic reactions when you alkalize and exercise beginning with an organic green drinks loaded with chlorophyll and purified ionized water from a quality water machinewater ionizer these allergies will begin to subside this is because these products introduce oxygenating and alkalizing elements into your body—helping to balance the conditions that may lead to hypersensitivitiesthe fatigue due to an acidic dietfatigue is probably the major symptom suffered by an overly acidic body the toxins produced in an acidic body environment reduce the absorption of protein and minerals which in turn weakens the bodys ability to produce enzymes and hormones this also interferes with the reconstruction of cells and other necessary components of energy production the result is fatigue poor endurance an inability to add muscle tone and general weakness to abolish your fatigue and become the energetic person you want to be begin by alkalizing with greens drinks like doc broc power plants and alkaline water from one of the excellent chanson water ionizers we’ve made availabledoc broc power plants greens drink powder is formulated to bring you vital nutrient elements and easily digested protein this alkalizing energizing and nourishing green formula begins oxygenating your body alkaline water and water ionizersthe most important thing you must learn is to hydrate the body with alkalizing water
