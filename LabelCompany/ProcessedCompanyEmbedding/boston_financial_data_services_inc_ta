industries by frank citronedecember  0 when it comes to innovation we can learn a lot from other industries take the food and beverage industry keurig the popular coffee brewer and kcup maker is expanding its kcup line with an instant version of campbell’s chicken noodle soup the new product will use a kcup for the broth and a separate packet for the dried noodles and veggies you might be thinking ok i can have some coffee with my soup now but how does this relate to innovation within the financial services industry innovation always begins with a problem to be solved what was keurig’s problem to be solved key patents on keurig’s kcups have expired thirdparty sales of coffee pods are increasing keurig’s problem to solve how to protect revenue and increase sales similarly when asset managers are challenged with how to increase sales they sometimes develop new products for example in 9 state street global advisors expanded its product line by launching the first etfs in the us companies must sometimes extend their own capabilities by relying on other firms to provide particular resources they do this by forming key partnerships in order to make new business models work a key component of keurig’s strategy is an innovative partnership with campbell likewise industry trends have prompted our clients to look for a comprehensive solution in the unclaimed property administration upa space in order to preserve assets while staying fully compliant with state regulations when faced with this problem to be solved boston financial developed a service which provided asset managers with onestop access to the most comprehensive set of unclaimed property solutions available in the marketplace today after evaluating options and performing due diligence on a number of vendors boston financial formed a strategic partnership with keane to complete this business model i don’t know if i’ll be using a keurig in the future to make chicken noodle soup but i can appreciate keurig’s ability to solve problems through innovation the food and beverage industry is vastly different from financial services however we still share common threads when it comes to the innovation

contact tag archives new product development category conferences and events innovation “if you’re not failing you’re not trying hard enough” by kim froiomarch  0 mia froio age  do you take risks big risks or small risks if you’re like me you take calculated risks ones where i feel fairly confident i’ll be successful  i must admit i’m pretty confident but do i have a fear of failing recently i attended the dst advance conference this was a multiday multitrack event with top industry speakers and panelists providing many key takeaways however given my role and ongoing quest for innovation the speaker that left the biggest impression on me was not an industry expert at all but rather an artist eric wahl is an internationally recognized graffiti artist and bestselling author who incorporates his business background and artistic talent into corporate speaking engagements he delivered not only an interesting keynote but a thought provoking show as i sat captivated by a mesmerizing scene of pure artistry and creativity by a modern day picaso set to the sound of bono’s “it’s a beautiful day” i couldn’t help but think do we take enough risks in our jobs do we have the mentality “fail first fail often” or are we more likely to respond to ideas with every reason why that idea won’t work during his presentation wahl challenged us to allow our creativity to flow without fear of failure as children we create through play as we have little to no experience with failure and therefore our ideas are uninhibited as illustrated here in my daughter mia’s artwork mia’s innocence and freedom to create something that reflected her own personal style without adhering to preconceived expectations is priceless as we get older we often inhibit our creativity as experience tells us all the reasons why the idea won’t work it’s time to reawaken our childhood creativity every day in business and in life we are faced with the challenge to proceed without fear of failing as a product manager i’m continually faced with identifying product opportunities that are profitable valuable to our clients and come with reasonable risk but it does take risk to move these product ideas forward for me the exciting challenge is figuring out how to present opportunities to the executive team illustrating that the opportunity is good for business and the reward offsets the risk one of our most profitable new businesses came with risk despite having a strong business case that captured critical factors such as market analysis value proposition market differentiators growth projections and financial benefits it failed due to risk  as a matter of fact my second and third pitch didn’t make it over the finish line either   with each pitch i had takeaway lessons that helped balance the market demand with a risk profile that was acceptable to the enterprise  and in the end i didn’t have much to lose ‘persistent’ could have been the worst adjective used to describe me so maybe i’m really not afraid to fail after all  and yes i believe that every great business has risks as business solutions providers our success depends upon us building and amplifying trust with our clients instead of measuring success by starting with economic results we need to determine what matters to our customers in terms of building their trust and drive idea creation towards exceeding their expectations will we fail from time to time yes but as wahl explained through his work we need to reprogram our minds…to look for ways to build back an emotional connection for customer loyalty if we fail nine times out of  chances are that one success story could be a game changer search search categories associate development and engagement blue sky business continuity cco
