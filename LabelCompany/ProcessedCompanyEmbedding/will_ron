us foreign policy congressman ron paul is holding steady in early polls—even pulling ahead of michele bachmann in gallup’s report last week—prompting many to ask why he isn’t getting more attention from the press  pm aug    by emily schultheis the weekly standard sorry youve reached the limit on the articles you can view congressman ron paul is holding steady in early polls—even pulling ahead of michele bachmann in gallup’s report last week—prompting many to ask why he isn’t getting more attention from the press the washington post provides its own explanation here  but while we were busy not covering paul this weekend the des moines register was the iowa paper reports two weeks away from the tenth anniversary of the  attacks presidential candidate and texas rep ron paul says that us intervention in the middle east is a main motivation behind terrorist hostilities toward america and that islam is not a threat to the nation at a campaign stop on saturday in winterset one man asked paul how terrorist groups would react if the us removed its military presence in middle eastern nations a move the candidate advocates “which enemy are you worried that will attack our national security” paul asked “if you’re looking for specifics i’m talking about islam radical islam” the man answered “i don’t see islam as our enemy” paul said “i see that motivation is occupation and those who hate us and would like to kill us they are motivated by our invasion of their land the support of their dictators that they hate” regarding  paul said that attacks against the us from middle eastern groups at home and abroad can be traced to the foreign presence of us troops as well as america’s relationships with dictator regimes paul referred to a military base in saudi arabia the birthplace of islam as a key motivator in the sept th attacks osama bin laden viewed it as an american desecration of holy land “after  people said ‘oh yeah it’s those very bad people who hate us’ but  of the hijackers came from saudi arabia” said paul “one of the reasons they attacked us is we propped up this sharia government and the fundamentalists hated us for it” if ron paul is anything hes consistent he has been saying the same thing for years such as these lines which he delivered on the house floor in   unfortunately the biggest failure of our government will be ignored im sure the commission will not connect our foreign policy of interventionism — practiced by both major parties for over a hundred years — as an important reason  occurred instead the claims will stand that the motivation behind  was our freedom prosperity and way of life if this error persists all the tinkering and money to improve the intelligence agencies will bear little fruit web link

insidealerts insidesources get uptodate news in your inbox  republican presidential candidate rep ron paul rtexas gestures after speaking at the university of california at berkeley calif on thursday april   ap photoben margot news politics ron paul sells freeze dryers able to ‘save your lives’ in glenn beck ads posted to politics april   by graham vyse email print share this tweet this ron paul’s revolution isn’t on ice anymore — it’s freezedried the  republican presidential candidate former texas congressman and libertarian icon debuted monday as a pitchman for the home freeze dryer company harvest right in north salt lake utah paul voiced a radio ad heard ahead of the nationally syndicated “glenn beck program” — broadcast just outside dallas in las colinas texas — and harvest right told insidesources the second spot will continue airing coast to coast on every station carrying the conservative talk show “we felt like their core values matched our product” operations manager matt neville said of paul and beck specifically praising their emphasis on financial responsibility and saving up for the future neville said harvest right freeze dryers can keep food preserved for  years equipping americans for everything from job loss to economic or natural disasters “it’s not a doomsday endoftheworld thing” he stressed “it’s more about prudent living” should doomsday come however paul said in his ad that harvest right “might just save your lives” this isn’t the first time the company has advertised with glenn beck his television network the blaze has pitched the business repeatedly in live commercials complete with product demonstrations that evoke the home shopping network these spots are central to the conservative media mogul’s plan to transform television advertisements outlined in a  interview with financing services firm btig beck explained how after each segment of his program the camera pulls back to a separate set high above the stage where he and his cohosts sit they remain visible in the background while onair sales talent makes pitches and a small countdown clock shows the remaining time before beck returns compared to traditional ads the approach has been remarkably effective “it’s the stupidest thing you’ve ever seen in your life but nobody turns the channel and they actually watch the commercial because it’s now part of the show” beck said key to this strategy is hiring men and women who look like average americans not “the beautiful people from hollywood” “they’re normal people” beck said “as long as they’re not fake as long as they’re genuine and they can put some things in from their lives people see them as real” acknowledging that not all ads can be product demonstrations the mogul said he planned to send camera crews out to find the stories that make companies like harvest right unique and relay those to his audience follow graham on twitter about the author graham vyse graham vyse is a reporter

bread and best of all it can fry a pound turkey in  minutesafter  years  million  pounds of fried turkey and uncounted thousands of pounds of potatoes fish bacon and other fried delicacies — much of it consumed by firefighters at station houses in beverly hills and coldwater canyon — ron popeil is ready to bring to market his greatest inventionyou’ve seen him on late night tv hawking his revolutionary products the blue eyes blazing with entrepreneurial zeal the helmet of shoepolish black hair the meaty sensual brandoesque lips formed into a broad porcelainveneered smile the stentorian voice like a boardwalk huckster’sbut wait there’s morepopeil has been called the einstein of the infomercial the hemingway of home shopping the salesman of the century he’s played himself on the simpsons and has been parodied on saturday night live weird al yankovic even produced a song about him on which popeil’s halfsister sang all the backup parts since he made his first commercial in the early s for the chopomatic hand food processor “ladies and gentlemen i’m going to show you the greatest kitchen appliance ever made” he’s been copied by every television pitchman and woman who has plied the airwavesimage via ronpopeil  instagrampopeil has brought us such enduring products as mr microphone the smokeless ashtray the popeil pocket fisherman the ronco electric food dehydrator and his sprayon remedy for bald spots glh formula  the glh stands for great looking hair like all the rest he came up with the name himselfhis most lucrative product to date the ronco showtime rotisserie  bbq has earned more than  billion worldwide maybe you’ve seen the infomercial the charismatic salesman demonstrating from the pulpit of his instudio kitchen the rapt audience in folding chairs the call and responsejust set it…and forget itpopeil began selling as a yearold pushing chopomatics for  — “all your onions chopped to perfection without shedding a single tear” — on chicago’s maxwell street a bustling city bazaar catering to tastes both high and lownow on a sunny afternoon more than  years later he is found in the spacious kitchencumrd center of his artfilled home in beverly hills wearing a blue apron and an air of crotchety determination the yearold popeil is readying himself for yet another demo of his most amazing product yet he’s hoping it could be the lastin two hours a wealthy investor from china will be walking through the door with a trusted advisor her name is sue or maybe it’s hsu he should have done more research but he just hasn’t had the time popeil has been told by an intermediary that hsu is “a real estate mogul billionaire who’s very into health and wellbeing” she wants to find a product she can purchase own brand and sell in china europe the us and south americait just so happens that popeil has exactly the thing she needshe gestures with a meaty hand the nails perfectly manicured toward the object sitting before him on the butcherblock counter ron popeil’s™ in fryer™manufactured in china to exacting standards — one of the reasons for all the years and expense­ — the in fryer™ cooks a pound turkey in  minutes or  full pounds of thick bacon in  minutes it steams it boils it makes rice it can even bake bread cakes or muffins in a fraction of the normal time that it seems to do four things and not five is beside the point what’s most important is this due to new regulations for home fryers that have recently gone into effect around the world there is nothing like popeil’s fryer on the market today yes folks ron popeil’s™ in fryer™ is the only product available on the planet that can cook an entire turkey using only  liters of cooking oil the mandated safe limitover the past five years popeil says the most popular fryer in the world the butterball turkey fryer has sold  units on qvc it has been available in  stores nationwidebut unfortunately for butterball even the smallest model requires  liters of cooking oil the product has been discontinuedleaving only one option according to popeil ron popeil’s™ in fryer™“if each of the  stores sells  pieces in  months you make over  million pure profit” popeil says in his practiced cadence warming up for his pitch “that’s every year because thanksgiving is not going away and every day people make bacon people fry chicken and french fries people steam vegetables and clams and lobster people boil eggs —  hard boiled eggs in  minutes it boils pasta and strains it it also bakes bread make a pizza bread or a whole wheat nut bread in an hour and twenty minutes”how much would you expect to pay for this onceinalifetime valueif ever a man needed to make a place for himself in the world it was ron popeilborn in may  in the bronx his parents divorced when he was three “neither of them wanted me or my older brother jerry so they dumped us and sent us off to a boarding school in upstate new york” popeil says “we were a liability they chose not to accept most of the early years were so painful that i blocked much of it out”he does have one vivid memory of that era he says it was parents’ visiting day all the other kids had visitors “i stood in the middle of this straight road that seemed to go on for an eternity hoping to see a speck of a car coming in my direction thinking that my family would come to visit us but they never did” to this day he can remember the feeling “just sitting on the road crying waiting for my mother and father”when popeil was eight his paternal grandparents “suddenly showed up one day unannounced” and took the boys to miami the family lived frugally on a “poor people’s diet” of chicken feet bean soup and potatoes “my grandmother was the kind who would take advantage of coupons and sales and walk miles to save  cents” his grandfather isadore a polish immigrant was unemployed “a mean unhappy man who didn’t believe in anybody or anything” popeil says “i never called him grandpa or even isadore he never had a name as far as i was concerned”five years later the grandparents packed up the boys and moved to chicago where their son and ron’s father sam popeil ran a company with his brother raymond that manufactured kitchen products the boys lived with their grandparents sam popeil lived in a hotel on weekends the grandparents would take the boys down to the popeil brothers factory and everybody would go to work the boys did a lot of cleaning up and packaging “i didn’t even get a chance to see my father because he was never there on the weekends” popeil sayswhen he was  in  popeil begged his father to allow him to go to maxwell street and try his hand at salesthe maxwell street market was established in the late nineteenth century by newly arrived jewish immigrants from eastern europe over the years other races and cultures were attracted to the market it was sometimes called the ellis island of the midwest an economic hub for poor people looking to get ahead almost anything was available at deep discounts — new or secondhand pirated or hijacked few questions were asked about the provenance of items for sale even though the old chicago police academy was just adjacent on o’brien streetmaxwell street market photo via mike leavenworth  flickr“the first time i went there” popeil says “the proverbial lightbulb went on over my head i saw all these people selling products pocketing money and my mind went racing”popeil gathered up a number of kitchen products from his father’s factory — “he sold them to me at wholesale so he made a full profit” — and went down to maxwell street at five o’clock one sunday morning“i pushed i yelled i hawked and it worked i was stuffing money into my pockets more money than i had ever seen in my life”at that moment popeil says he realized he’d found his calling“i figured out that sales could help me escape from the poverty and the miserable existence i had with my grandparents i had lived for  years in homes without love now i finally found a form of affection — and a human connection — through sales”from then on the course of his life was seton days he didn’t go to school young popeil would be at the market at the crack of dawn to prepare  pounds each of onions cabbages and carrots and  pounds of potatoes to use in his demonstrations he’d work the crowds all day long bringing in as much as  a fortune at the time in his late teens he began traveling to state and county fairs eventually he got himself a prime spot inside the woolworth’s department store in chicago’s loop the topgrossing woolworth’s location in the countrywhen not working popeil lived the high life he dined at the pump room wore a rolex rented hotel suites in pictures from the period he carries himself like a matinee idol eventually he moved his offices to the playboy building over the years he’d count among his friends such titans of industry as hotelier steve wynn “he was mesmerizing” says mel korey popeil’s college friend and first business partner “there were secretaries who would take their lunch break at woolworth’s to watch him because he was so goodlooking”in summer  after the vegomatic was introduced popeil founded ronco already aware what television could do for his products he shot a twominute commercial for the handy dandy kitchen appliance a descendant of the chopomatic which sliced and diced fruits and vegetables then he set out across the midwest to persuade local stores to carry the product once that was accomplished popeil and korey visited local tv stations and bought the cheapest airtime they could find — often late at night the cost to popeil for a vegomatic was  they sold it to the stores for  the retail price was once the commercials ran stores could hardly keep the product on the shelves popeil never looked backin his piece on popeil “the pitchman” written at the turn of the century the new yorker’s malcolm gladwell sums up beautifully the nut of popeil’s success“why did the vegomatic sell so well doubtless americans were eager for a better way of slicing vegetables but it was more than that the vegomatic represented a perfect marriage between the medium television and the message the gadget … more specifically you could train the camera on the machine and compel viewers to pay total attention to the product you were selling tv allowed you to do even more effectively what the best pitchmen strove to do in live demonstrations — make the product the star”in his beverly hills kitchen surrounded by his collection of olive oil bottles from around the world popeil readies the raw materials for his demonstration according to the guinness book of world records the oil collection more than  bottles — displayed in glassfront cabinets and in every available nook and cranny — is the world’s largest one of his few personal indulgences he says along with his foot custommade gunmetal gray almar fishing boat the pocket fisherman he has no idea how many gallons of canola oil he has used in the  years developing ron popeil’s™ in fryer™ “no doubt it could float my boat” popeil musesas he has done since he was a youngster popeil has gone to the market himself to carefully select each piece of food for the demo there are onions for chopping and tomatoes for slicing — each one as large and as perfect in appearance as he could find there are turkeys chicken parts bacon slices and a whole fish to fryand because the potential investor is chinese there are boxes of fried squid and frozen wontons“the thing is this” he says pulling the guts out of one of the turkeys “my goal here is to sell the project to somebody not to go back into business there’s nothing that will get me to go back into business that’s what i don’t want to do anymore what a headache how many employees do you have do you have insurance where’s your warehouse how many secretaries who’s running customer service what’s your lease like where you arethat’s running a business and that’s what i no longer want to do“what i want to do is continue inventing more products because inventing isn’t work that’s doing what i want when i want to do it which in my mind is the real secret to life the true sign of success it’s not money it’s not power it’s doing what you want when you want to do it that’s the golden ticket right so here i’ve created a situation that’s quite interesting”the kitchen grows quiet as he thrusts the turkey’s pale carcass beneath the faucet and gives it a warm bath at  pounds the turkey is about the size of a weekold infant“george foreman got  million of stock and cash for the rights to his grill” popeil says thoughtfully “wolfgang puck got  million for the rights to his soups those are both solid names but neither of them have over  years in the business”how much would you expect to pay for this onceinalifetime valuehis blue eyes blaze his voice rises in volume like a carnival barker’s“i’m not looking for  million i’m not even looking for  million not even  million”operators are standing bymike sager is features editor at mel he previously wrote about a man living off the grid in the suburbs of san diegofor more mel follow us on medium or subscribe
