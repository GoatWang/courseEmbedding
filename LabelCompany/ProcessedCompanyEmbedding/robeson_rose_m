your reviews i am beginning to see that all those who try to teach high power manifestation thing energy healing they all have low vibration because they offer an easy fix… something you just create in your mind following their mind teachings without putting any work to it i would like to know the vibration of dr mark sircus and his teaching drsircuscom i have his books and use his protocols i am beginning to see some things there too… thank you so much your vibrational reviews have been very helpful all of the ‘gurus’ etc that i have been involved with over the years are virtually all under

next vibrational review hi sophie thanks for the honest and insightful reviews i was searching to see if there is a review on this erika awakening who uses eft and her healing work… but couldn’t find… httperikaawakeningcomerikaawakening this was brought to my attention by a friend who was sharing her content would appreciate your review on her erika awakening personal vibration 0 inner state extreme anxiety difficulty to breathe worry it centers mostly around the stomach but rises to the throat occasionally some greed eft eft is not effective at all beliefs cannot be eliminated only controlled controlling beliefs is what makes one not breathe… result a shitty life and illness eft may work through the principle of placebo placebo actually a good technique just unreliable  of clients get some results according to my muscle testing but it is a flash in the pan result… temporary the biggest problem is that the methods promote greed… which is the desire trap utter misery
