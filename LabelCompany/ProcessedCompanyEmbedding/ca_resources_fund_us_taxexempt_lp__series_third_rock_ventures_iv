enables our board of directors and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role particularly with respect to risk interrelationships compensation risk assessment we believe that although a portion of the compensation provided to our executive officers and other employees is performancebased our executive compensation program does not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking this is primarily due to the fact that our compensation programs are designed to encourage our executive officers and other employees to remain focused on both shortterm and longterm strategic goals in

meetings board leadership we do not currently have a chairman of the board but we have appointed mark l perry to serve as our lead independent director we believe that the appointment of a lead independent director allows our chief executive officer to focus on our daytoday business while allowing the lead independent director to lead our board of directors in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management our board of directors recognizes the time effort and energy that the chief executive officer is required to devote to his position in the current business environment as well as the commitment required to serve as our lead independent director particularly as our board of directors oversight responsibilities continue to grow while our bylaws and corporate governance guidelines do not require that we appoint a separate chairman of the board or lead independent director and chief executive officer our board of directors believes that having a chief executive officer and a separate designated lead independent director is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance our separated lead independent director and chief executive officer positions are augmented by the independence of eight of our nine directors and our entirely independent board committees that provide appropriate oversight in the areas described above at executive sessions of independent directors these directors speak candidly on any matter of interest without the chief executive officer or other executives present the independent directors met four times in  without management present we believe this structure provides consistent and effective oversight of our management and

shutting down the chat room upon completion of the video program description technical field the present invention relates generally to text communications over a communications network such as the internet more particularly the invention concerns concurrent viewing of video programming and of text communications between viewers of the video programming background of the invention in recent years communications networks such as the internet have become popular for their ability to enable people to communicate a virtually limitless variety of information across great distances more importantly the development of the internet has enabled persons even with relatively little technical training to find send and receive information using a browsing device eg a personal computer or a television settop box stb running a browser program eg microsoft® internet explorer or netscape navigator this in turn has led to meteoric growth in internet use one internet feature which has gained particular popularity provides for realtime text conversations between users these conversations referred to as “chat” typically involve a number of individuals each of whom is in communication with a chat server where messages from each participant are received for distribution to all other participants once received by the chat server the messages are available to the browsing devices where they are presented to respective participants the chat server thus establishes a virtual “chat room” where participants can carry on a text conversation over the internet due to the vast number of internet users and the similarly vast number of chat rooms it has become common practice to define a topic for discussion in a given chat room the topic may be defined by agreement of the participants but more typically is established by the chat service provider upon creation of the chat room the topic may be maintained by the chat service provider policing the chat room and limiting participation to those who engage in discussion on the defined topic alternatively the chat room may be controlled by the participants themselves in either event however the chat room typically is a somewhat permanent fixture available to participants throughout the day in order to access the internet many users subscribe to internet access services which provide a convenient standardized interface between users and the vast number of internet sites one such internet access service is the webtv® internet access network webtv is a registered trademark of webtv networks inc of mountain view calif the webtv internet access network links a large number of browsing devices referred to as client terminals with at least one host server which directs the flow of information to and from the client terminals the client terminals are connected to the host server via conventional modem pools either by integrated services digital network isdn connections telephone lines or other data links using these connections users are able to access informational sites established by internet publishers and are able to access “chat rooms” whereby they may participate in interactive text conversations online the host server also may offer supplemental services such as email news reports television program guides and enhanced access to certain web pages for subscribers of the service although chat rooms are accessible to most users of the internet it can sometimes be difficult to find a chat room directed to a particular topic especially when that topic has a limited period of relevance chat rooms relating to television programs fall into this category for example a chat room relating to a particular television show is of greatest interest for a short period around the time the show is aired unfortunately there may not be a permanent chat room dedicated to a particular show where viewers can congregate and even where such a chat room exists a viewer may have difficulty locating the particular chat room and thus may be discouraged from experiencing chat rooms in the past some television broadcasters have attempted to make chat available to viewers by providing chat rooms related to particular programming others have attempted to incorporate selected excerpts from relevant chat rooms into the broadcast itself however until now viewers have not been provided with a system and method whereby they are able to simultaneously view a video program and participate in a chat room related to the video program using the same display moreover viewers have been unable to select a chat option while viewing a video program so that the viewers may chat during the video program summary of invention a method and a system are provided for linking chat rooms and television viewing more particularly a system is provided in which a video signal such as a television program is received and displayed to viewers the system has a userselectable chat option in which viewers can enter text messages that will be displayed to other viewers of the video signal who have also selected the chat option in one embodiment the video signal is displayed on a graphical user interface in the form of a template having a video region for display of the video signal and a chat region for display of the text messages in some embodiments the system also provides a viewer the ability to select among a plurality of different television programs to display the system then provides a plurality of separate chat rooms each associated with a corresponding television program upon selection of the chat option when viewing a particular one of the television programs a viewer is placed in a chat room corresponding to the displayed television program thereafter text messages from viewers of the same program who have likewise selected the chat option are displayed to each other brief description of the drawings fig  is a somewhat schematic view of a browsing device in the form of a settop box

arrangement in particular video region  in fig  is larger than the video region shown in fig  or fig  chat region  is smaller and is disposed below the video region as indicated the informational region may be positioned at the left side and may include a clock  and a television program identifier  a logo region  may be positioned in the upper left hand corner and can display the network service provider logo as shown or may display a television network a local affiliate or a show logo as previously described fig  depicts another chat user interface embodiment which utilizes a full screen video region  as indicated chat region  together with text entry box  and send button  may occupy the entire screen and are superimposed over the television program this has the advantage of providing the maximum space for both video and chat regions but legibility of the text messages may be reduced with some video content figs  and  depict two alternative paths for a user to enter a chat room related to a television program fig  depicts a program information interface in which information such as a show time and episode description is presented for a particular television show an interactive link  allows a user to automatically connect to a related website upon activation as described previously for link  a similar chat link  may be provided which transfers the user into the associated chat room upon selection as with chat icon  video region  displays the selected television show if it is currently playing otherwise the video region will display the currently playing show on the selected channel the interface also typically provides user selectable buttons   and  to allow a user to control recording of the show by an attached vcr not shown to set a reminder to appear prior to the start of the show and to exit the program information interface respectively fig  depicts an options screen that can be actuated using the remote control while viewing a television program as indicated the options screen may include an interactive link  a chat link  and user selectable buttons   and  which allow a user to access a programming guide for a current day access the previouslydescribed program information interface and access a television favorites mode where still images from multiple channels are displayed simultaneously on separate small areas of the screen the options screen also may include a user selectable button  which links the user to a chat room related to the current program upon selection button  is shown in the highlighted condition in fig  it should be understood that in the described embodiment the presence of a chat room for a particular show is optional for instance the network service provider ultimately controls whether or not a chat link is presented to the user by controlling the display of the settop box thus a chat room may be provided only for certain shows a broadcast network may contract with the network service provider to have a chat room for all of the shows broadcast by that network alternatively shows may be individually selected to have an associated chat room based on user interest or other considerations whether or not a chat link shows up for a particular television show typically is controlled by data in the electronic programming guide in the electronic programming guide each show has a unique identifier thus a chat link may be created by simply changing a corresponding field in the electronic programming guide entry for the particular show that field may then be monitored by the settop box to determine whether or not to display a chat link when that show is active of course the appearance of the chat link could be controlled many other ways such as by information broadcast with the show such information could be a specific control signal or monitoring the closed captioning text for a particular keyword for instance referring to fig  operation of an exemplary entertainment system is demonstrated the depicted system including a chat client a host server and a chat server as indicated when a user selects a chat option for a show x a chat request typically is sent to the host server which responds by sending an html formatted web page to the chat client for use in dynamically creating the desired user interface alternatively the html formatted web page may be stored in memory at the chat client or elsewhere for ready retrieval by the chat client the html formatted web page thus may be employed as a user interface template for use in quickly creating a desired user interface it will be appreciated that various alternative templates may be used to create alternative user interfaces as described above furthermore the template employed may be selected based on an identifying characteristic of the broadcast video signal upon identifying such a characteristic for example a template may be selected which defines a video region for display of the broadcast video signal a chat region for display of text communications and a logo region for display of a logo which reflects the identifying characteristic of the broadcast video signal it thus will be appreciated that the interface may be customized based on the particular show episode network network affiliate or other consideration the network affiliate and program name which are typically used to control the branding or logo selection for the user interface generally are stored in the electronic programming guide in the entry for the particular show the server may use the show episode network or affiliate information to select a particular template the template then may be used to provide for presentation of a predefined user interface file for the particular show episode network or affiliate being viewed if there is more than one interface that might apply to a particular show eg an interface for the network and an interface for the show are available the most specific interface eg the interface for the show is typically chosen referring still to fig  it will be noted that the server response also includes instructions to the settop box identifying the chat server this allows for communication between the chat client and the desired chat room it should be understood that the chat server functionality could be integrated into the host server system or could reside on any number of separate server systems the settop box automatically connects to the chat server into a chat room identified using the show identifier for show x the chat room may in fact be created upon request of a chat client to chat about a particular show this tends to reduce the number of chat rooms which must be serviced by the chat server at any given time if there is no interest in chatting about a particular show the server will not create a chat room for that show using the show identifier in the chat room designation allows simple and automatic linking of the various viewers of the show also because the show identifier is unique it is unlikely that two shows will have the same chat room designation users in the chat room are typically identified by their user id although any other suitable identifier could be used the chat server runs a standard chat server software such as ired the server software maintains a table of the various participants in the chat room and echoes all messages from any of the participants to all of the participants the settop box runs corresponding client software which forwards messages entered in the text entry box to the chat server and displays the messages forwarded from the server in the case of a personal computer based client the user might have custom software to link to the chat room corresponding to a video program being viewed alternatively a personal computer user could link to the chat by running a standard chat client program such mirc and entering the appropriate chat server identification and chat room identification if the personal computer user does not have access to electronic programming guide data as described above the pc user could be provided with the necessary information via a website related to the current show via data embedded in the broadcast signal of the show or by requesting the information from the host server normally participants in the chat room for a particular show will leave within a short period following the end of the show however if participants do not exit the chat room spontaneously they may receive a “shows over” reminder in place of the show time to encourage closure of the chat room after a predetermined duration of time the chat server may unilaterally close the chat room this is helpful in ensuring that the chat server is able to adequately serve chat rooms for all shows currently being broadcast urging users to exit the chat room may also help to avoid chat between chat clients viewing the show in different time zones it is also possible however that the chat room could simply be maintained until such time as the last participant has left the chat room moreover interactive link  may be changed to be a link to the chat room for the next show playing on that network thus a user would be encouraged to continue viewing and chatting about the particular networks shows it should be noted that the video region will be displaying the current show on the network so that the new chat link would take the user to the chat room for the show playing after the end of the show associated with the current chat room as indicated above one challenge presented by chat rooms linked to a particular show is that the show may play at different times in different time zones thus depending on the length of the show the show may or may not have ended by the time it starts in the next time zone thus it may be desirable to create time zone specific chat rooms to eliminate the possibility of intersecting usage by participants in different time zones the various changes that may occur at the end of a show are implemented by the settop box which using the show data in the electronic programming guide can determine when a particular show has ended by comparing the show time to an internal clock fortunately the internal clock is specific to the particular time zone and thus correctly tracks show play times in the current zone while the invention has been
