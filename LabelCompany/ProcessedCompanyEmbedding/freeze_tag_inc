uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forwardlooking statements factors that could cause actual results or events to

economic financial and business conditions changes in and compliance with governmental regulations changes in various tax laws and the availability of key management and other personnel table of contents summary overview freeze tag inc is a leading creator of mobile social games that are fun and engaging for all ages based on a freetoplay business model that has propelled games built and marketed by some of our competitors to worldwide to worldwide success we employ stateoftheart data analytics and proprietary technology to dynamically optimize the gaming experience for revenue generation players can download and enjoy our games for free or they can purchase virtual items and additional features within the game to increase the fun factor our games encourage players to compete and engage with their friends on major social networks such as facebook and twitter during our most recent fiscal year ended december   we generated revenues of  from the sales of our games or inapp purchases in our games compared to  for the year ended december   going forward with our shift to freetoplay games we anticipate the vast majority of our revenue in future years will be derived from consumers making ingame purchases in one of our freetoplay games and that revenue from consumers paying to download a game will be minimal our business strategy is now focused on freetoplay games that require constant updates and new content to keep players engaged therefore we no longer measure our success based upon the quantity of titles we launch but rather on the metrics we receive as we monitor and try to improve upon our games in the market in q of  we began increasing the production of our mobile games by using some existing game frameworks and hiring outside developers and art resources to help with the initial development stages of building a mobile game as a result we launched  mobile games or content updates between august and december  � word quest  august   we have also announced our intention to grow the company through acquisition we feel that the time is right to build an alliance of mobile game developers who can become stronger and more successful by working together to build a company that can leverage market intelligence development expertise and crosspromotional opportunities to achieve great results for our customers and shareholders during the year ended december   we generated a net loss of  primarily attributable to increases in cost of sales and loss on change in derivative liabilities as described below going concern uncertainty as shown in the accompanying financial statements we incurred net losses of  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively as of december   our accumulated deficit was  during the years ended december l  and  we experienced negative cash flows from operations largely due to continued investment spending for product development of game titles for smartphones and tablets that are expected to benefit future periods those facts along with our lack of access to a significant bank credit facility create an uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern accordingly we are currently evaluating alternatives to secure financing sufficient to support the operating requirements of its current business plan as well as continuing to execute its business strategy of distributing game titles to digital distribution outlets including mobile gaming app stores online pc and mac gaming portals and opportunities for new devices such as tablet mobile internet device applications mobile gaming platforms and international licensing opportunities our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our success in securing sufficient financing and in successfully executing our plans to return to positive cash flows during fiscal  our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we were unable to continue as a going concern table of contents critical accounting estimates revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily by licensing software products in the form of online and downloadable games for pc mac and smartphone platforms we distribute our products primarily through online games portals and smartphone device manufacturers distribution partners which market the games to endusers the nature of our business is such that we sell games basically through four distribution outlets  web portals brick and mortar retail distributors mobile distributors and publishers and our own web portal wwwfreezetagcom however going forward the majority of our revenue will be derived from mobile distribution partners such as apple google and amazon product sales web and mobile revenues we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers and once any performance obligations have been completed revenue from product sales is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection licensing revenues retail revenues royalties thirdparty licensees distribute games under license agreements with us we receive royalties from the licensees as a result we recognize these royalties as revenues upon receipt of the monthly or quarterly varies per distribution partner revenue reports provided by the partner revenue from licensingroyalties is recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price protection some license agreements require a royalty advance from the licenseedistributor in which case the original advance is recognized as a liability and royalty revenue is deducted from the advance as earned other revenues other revenues primarily include ad game revenue and workforhire game related revenue we derive our advertising game revenue from certain of our partners that offer our games free of charge to consumers in exchange for the consumers being exposed to advertising embedded in our games in this way we do not receive revenue for the sale of our games but rather a percentage of the advertising revenue generated by these player views this method of generating revenue is essentially the same as traditional radio or television advertising where consumers are allowed to enjoy content for free but are forced to watch or listen to advertising before in between and at the end of the programming content additionally we derive some revenue from workforhire projects some of our partners occasionally ask us to render workforhire services for them such as preparing packaging materials for example a retail game and dvd publisher hired us to create several designs for printed packages that were used for games published by the publisher but not developed by us for this work we charge a onetime fixed fee for each package design table of contents we recognize this revenue once all performance obligations have been completed in addition persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist and collection of the related receivable must be probable we recognize revenue in accordance with current accounting standards when an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents we place our cash and cash equivalents with large commercial banks the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insures these balances up to  all of our cash balances at december   and december   were insured at december   and  there were no cash equivalents allowances for returns price protection and doubtful accounts because the majority of our business is derived through online portals such as big fish games and wireless online app stores such as apple there is no physical product other than the downloadable bits of our games that is involved in the customer purchase in the digital environment the customer cannot return a digital download product therefore there are no returns the customer can ask for a refund of a digital product and if there are any then they are reconciled or netted out by our distribution partners before we receive the corresponding payments and royalty statements as such we do not allow for returns bad debts or price protection of digital download products however we derive a small portion of our revenues from sales of physical packaged software for personal computers through distribution partners who sell through traditional retail channels product revenue is recognized net of allowances for price protection and returns and various customer discounts our distribution partners who sell to retailers may allow returns for our packaged personal computer products these partners may decide to provide price protection or allow returns for personal computer products after they analyze property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets all assets are currently depreciated over  years maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred renewals and improvements of a major nature are capitalized at the time of retirement or other disposition of property and equipment the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are reflected in the statement of operations table of contents concentrations of credit risk major customers and major vendors our customers are the endconsumers that purchase its games from the websites where we have our games listed for sale therefore we do not have any individual customers that represent any more than a fraction of its revenue however we do have primary distribution partners which are the owners of the websites where it sells its games under our distribution agreements we are not obligated to make distribute or sell any games however for any games we do make and wish to distribute we can list them on one or more of these websites under a revenue sharing arrangement where we shares the revenue from any of our games that sell the sharing arrangement varies greatly depending on the distributor with the company generally keeping between  and  of the revenue and the distributor keeping the remainder of the revenue generated by each sale at times we enter into exclusivity options whereby if a distributor wishes to have an exclusive period carrying our games normally  days we will agree to that in exchange for the distributor marketing the game in their newsletter and other marketing programs due to the fact we have a number of distribution partners and a variety of different websites where we can sell our games we are not substantially dependent on any of our distribution partners or agreements in addition to the distribution agreements we currently have a licensing agreement with paws inc which allow us to develop and distribute games around third party intellectual property in exchange for paying royalty payments we are not substantially dependent on that licensing agreement for the year ended december   the companys primary distributors that represented  or more of its revenues were apple   square
