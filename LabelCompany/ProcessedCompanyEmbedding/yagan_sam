cofounded okcupid with  far more talented people chris coyne max krohn and christian rudder after we sold okcupid to match i became the ceo of the match group which includes not just match and okcupid but also tinder meetic ourtime and about  other brands around the world incredulously i have been named to time magazine’s “ most influential people in the world” and fortune magazine’s “ under ” the three most common new years resolutions involve moneycareer healthfitness and relationships making this our busiest time of the year as millions of people make finding love a renewed priority ive got  years of experience running dating businesses and all the data at my fingertips ready to help you if i can ama httpstwittercomredditamastatus thanks so much for your questions please check out okcupid match tinder or any of our other products i hope you enjoyed this ama as much as i did best sam sam yagan jan   i very clearly pointed out in my profile that i will totally not murder any of my potential matches but for some reason i cant find true love any ideas on how i can improve my odds warlizard maybe have a more inviting username than warlizard  sam yagan could you please implement a function on okcupid that allows for people to search and see if theyre in their matches preferred age range this is a common addition that gets asked for a lot on rokcupid catspajammies im not sure well do it exactly that way but we have often discussed ways of enforcing peoples age preferences the problem is that not everyone cares about their age ranges equally meaning that many people dont at all mind chatting with people outside their ranges  their ranges are a preference but not a firm filter sam yagan is online dating good for society why or why not and what are the potential unintended consequences of this behavior btw i met girlfriend of over a year on okcupid so thanks  bhalp i love this question ive long believed that dating apps truly make society better in several ways  undoubtedly greater choice leads to the selection of higher quality spouses  technology makes it easier to meet people who are less similar farther away different socioeconomic levels different ethnicity etc  the ease of getting back in the dating market makes empowers people in bad relationships to leave them knowing that loneliness isnt the only alternative to their current situation sam yagan being the ceo of a group that discernably specialises in finding love have you personally used any of your services and subsequently found success jairachi heres some okcupid trivia none of the four founders has ever been on an online date of any kind sam yagan how has the role of data and algorithms changed in the life of okcupid i feel like initially it was more datadriven and gave users more access to match percentages lately the interface has felt more tinderlike focusing on spending less time per match and showcasing photos and quick blurbs of text if any do you think this trend of focusing on quick picturebased interactions will continue thank you josephkp i wouldnt say its about picturebased or not picturebased pictures are always important in any dating environment more important though is the form factor the average person checks her smartphone over  times a day and the average time a person spends in an app is about  second consumers now expect to get value from an app in under a minute while we at okcupid are as datageeky as ever the interface for users will continue to evolve to feel as current and relevant as possible sam yagan but treadmills might lead to better dates readdancelove i think youve just come up with the next big thing sam yagan does the freeness of okc attract a different group of people as compared to matchs subscription fee do you think this would even go as far to affect the relationship that could be formed from each site which site sees the most traffic how does that relate to matches last one how it feel know youre sites have paired literally tens of thousands of people together link each dating product attracts a different user and freeness is just one component tinder  okc attract different users match and ourtime attract different users etc so yes match users and okc users are different i hate talking about better quality when referring to human beings but it is true that people who pay for match likely have higher intent than people on okcupid or tinder sam yagan yea ive heard that before ive always wondered though why not is there any specific reason you guys chose to not try out online dating yourselves okalt we were all dating our future wives when we started okc and before that we were basically in college where online dating wasnt really pervasive sam yagan youve owned and sold many successful companies what are some of your best productivity tips bonus question whats your favorite color tonywork ill take the extra credit first orange  as for productivity   i view every minute as previous and try not to waste time doing anything that isnt very productive or very enjoyable   email can be a huge waste of time or incredibly efficient for me its the latter i write about  emails a year and its easily my primary mode of communication   i set priorities and try to stick to them if i am working on something really important or really urgent i ask myself why i am doing it sam yagan hey there i actually just wanted to let you know that i found the love of my life on okcupid weve been together for  years how is the overall satisfaction rate for your other endeavors nerfherdess thats awesome you made my day we get countless success stories from users across all of our products so i think satisfaction rates are pretty high at the end of the day you get out of dating products what you put into them so people who really engage earnestly usually find success sam yagan hi sam i was wondering what historical data tells us about all these new users for both genders that pop up at the beginning of the year presumably because they made finding love part of their  resolution sometimes i wonder how many of them will actually end up sticking around the okcupid community or will most of these rush profiles end up being abandoneddeactivated in a few days much like gym goers in january disappears after the first week and not really worth messaging by the way thank you for founding okcupid youve helped me find happy meaningful relationships that helped me grow over the years  ottawapharmer great question while certainly a few of the people who signup for dating apps in the new years rush dont stick around the vast majority do not sure how that compares with gym memberships but my guess is that dating apps do better since they dont require you to actually get out of your house show up at a gym and then exercise you can just fire up the app wherever you are and then have fun on dates dates are better than treadmills  sam yagan how active is okcs user base outside of the us and eu thanks for doing this ama herbalwine okc does really well in englishspeaking countries and really poorly outside its on our list  sam yagan why do high matches on okcupid ignore each other am i not grabbing peoples attention why is it harder for same sex daters to find dates on okcupid jbwncster on your second question i believe that okcupid is the dating app of choice for most samesex daters we have always welcomed samesex daters and individuals from other marginalized communities why do high matches ignore each other well most people ignore other people  online and offline  but christian has done the research and we know for a fact that high match percentages definitely increase the probability that two people will communicate if you send me a link to your profile i can try to see if i have any suggestions to make it more grabby  sam yagan what has been the biggest challenge of your career iggtastic gosh so many i think the biggest challenge was turning okcupid around in  okc really wasnt doing well growth had slowed we were running out of money wed been doing it for six years and the founders were all getting impatient but we all dug in and saved the company turning it in to what it is today sam yagan hi sam thanks for this ama i was really wondering how a day in the life of sam yagan looks like bonus question  what are some of your hobbies and how do you get by a weekend dyorel i spend a lot of time traveling we have offices in dallas nyc la paris rio sf etc but when i wake up at home i typically get up early today was  go for a run today was k and get my kids ready for school and off to the bus stop i try to be at work by  and spend most of my day talking to the people who run the various businesses tinder match okcupid meetic etc or our big functions technology product finance marketing analytics etc then home for dinner with the family before catching up on email after the kids turn in hobbies i used to have them now i just have little kids  sam yagan what do you think is the biggest hurdle in making internet dating cool justwing it gets more and more mainstream every day i dont even really care about cool i just want it to be normal i want everyone who wants lovefriendshipdatesrelationships to have them i want to contribute to that mission every single day and i dont want anyone to be deprived of affection or companionship because the most effective tool ever created  online dating  is somehow not cool or normal enough it just makes me sad sam yagan whats your favorite kind of soup ismellawesome used to be cream of mushroom now probably something with butternut squash or corn or both sam yagan how do you feel about people using your sites for side action its unfortunate but i know it does happen

look it was in the ballpark so i called three other potential bidders four months later we agreed to sell to matchcom a subsidiary of iac for  million in cash we felt like it was a chance to give our investors our employees and us a great return and do right by our customers since match agreed not to change anything for the other  people here at okcupid nothing has changed thats part of my job i have a lot more meetings i go to dallas where match is based once a month for two days i also get to take things off my plate like finance hr and legal that were less interesting to me i like being part of a big companys executive team its fun to stretch other parts of my brain considering questions like how should we think of acquisitions i get to be privy to things that would never come up at a small company plus i think this year my wife and i will actually get to go on vacation but on the other hand—all i know how to do is start companies what do i say when people ask me what i do i work for a big company i mean a lot of people do its great but its almost like having a sexchange operation part of me is like whats my identity if its not the company im building there is a soul search that is happening parallel to my daytoday life my okcupid cofounders are my best friends we were in each others weddings the other night we went out to dinner we spent half our time bullshitting around and then we started discussing our future whether its now or in a year or five years do we want to start another company together what are peoples goals in life i can imagine a life where a big paycheck and the cool perks and being part of the executive team of a big company would be great id love to summer in the hamptons but im still in a building phase im  years old in most jobs your early s to early s are your power years so if this is my power decade should i be saying this is the time for my big entrepreneurial move should i try to build a billiondollar company should we put all our money together and say what is the next linkedin or groupon or facebook if i start again i can now fundraise better but i still start at square one its still going to be four guys in a small office with ikea desks part of me is like is that still appealing and it is life is just a set of experiences as long as there are new experiences for me in a corporate job i dont think i have to be an entrepreneur the cool thing about being an entrepreneur is i can guarantee to myself that its going to be new because im going to make it so previous surviving a really bad year  next how one

listed in the  time  admitted that the other three cofounders of okcupid okc had never been on an online date eitherhe explained “we were all dating our future wives when we started okc and before that we were basically in college where online dating wasnt really pervasive”dissatisfied with this answer one redditor quipped “sounds like a ringing endorsement”nonetheless yagan reiterated his belief that online dating was “the most effective tool ever created” for finding “affection or companionship” he also offered guidance to one frustrated redditor going by the name “warlizard” who wondered why he had yet to find “true love” on an online dating siteyagan ventured “maybe have a more inviting username than warlizard ”the king of the “swipe right” universe declined to confirm if a paid version of tinder was in the works nor was he able to satisfy everyone with a question to ask in the limited time availableas one put it “so just like on okcupid you respond a couple times and
