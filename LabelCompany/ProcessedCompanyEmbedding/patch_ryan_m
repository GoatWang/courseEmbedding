have recommended them to everyone i see because of how easy to use they are and the price is perfect too reviewed by leslie shropshire from canada   five stars is not enough stars let me start by saying that i have never had bariatric surgery before and found the multiple vitamin patch by accident online while trying to find an otc pain patch for my knee this is the first time in my  years of living on this earth that i have found something that actually works and works almost immediately i have tried every vitamin and mineral supplement on the market at one time or the other and words are not enough to express how great the multiple vitamin and mineral supplement patch is i am not kidding when i say that five stars is not enough stars to rate these patches on day  i noticed increased energy levels after about  days of using the patch i noticed my lifelong and otherwise weak brittle peeling fragile fingernails were thicker and hard as rocks this has never happened before  never and ive even taken vitamin shots on a weekly basis for over a year while on a calorie restricted diet i wasnt looking for or even expecting this to happen in less than  days of starting these patches i no longer feel the need to take a nap during the day and this is the first saturday in my lifetime that i woke up at a decent hour wide awake and ready to get out of bed the change in my energy level is so noticeable that my husband tried one of the patches and on the first day he noticed a significant energy boost now is using up my patches and wont go a day without one there is no comparison between these patches and regular vitamin shots high dosages of b or anything i have ever bought or been prescribed in my  years of life on this earth the convenience of simply putting on one patch versus taking a handful of pills each day  well words are not enough to describe i will never ever ever ever go back to taking vitaminsmineral supplements by mouth again i was not prepared nor expecting to see these results over several months of use much less over just a day or two of use reviewed by sharon cantrell from canada   pathetic its been a month and i havent received the product despite exorbitant shipping coststracking not available and the customer sucks with no response from the company reviewed by verified buyer tashika ojageer from durban    multi vitamin gold this is the best thing that has ever happened for me i recently got weight loss surgery and anything by mouth has to be crushed these patches have made my life so much easier one less thing to worry about there super easy to use and give me all i need in one simple little patch reviewed by doreene mercado from canada   best way to get your vitamins ive encountered  issues when buying vitamins  huge horse pills  chewables have a bad taste i was thrilled when i saw this simple convenient option its so easy to peel and stick these anywhere also easy to take when traveling  so small thanks to you i will never have to look for another source for post op vitamins reviewed by tamarahan gaudet from canada   it is a dream to use these vitamin patches easy to use no hassle with crushing pills or adding to smoothies no more big pills to swallow feeling results reviewed by janet finney from canada   a great alternative for the entire family i first learned about the variety of vitamins and supplements available from patch md when i was preparing for bariatric surgery this seemed like an ideal solution for me since most of the chewable vitamins on the market contain some sort of sugar substitute which i had completely eliminated everywhere else in my diet however it turns out that these products became the ideal solution for my wife and daughters who have a problem with vitamin absorption and always complained about the numerous digestive side effects they found when using otc multivitamins and iron supplements my daughters iron levels have significantly increased after using this product for just one month my wife hasnt gotten her blood work yet but i am certain they will reflect the benefits of using the patch rather than oral delivery method i will report back after the doctor checks her results reviewed by michael meilinger from canada   multivitamin patch ive used the multivitamin patch for  days now the first day i blistered the nd and rd days i ended up
