navigation search the values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers an investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group these advantages include an ability to hire professional investment managers which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management benefit from economies of scale ie lower transaction costs increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk terminology varies with country but investment funds are often referred to as investment pools collective investment vehicles collective investment schemes managed funds or simply funds the regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities or short collective investment undertaking cf law an investment fund may be held by the public such as a mutual fund exchangetraded fund specialpurpose acquisition company or closedend fund or it may be sold only in a private placement such as a hedge fund or private equity fund the term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds which are unique bankmanaged funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts investment funds are promoted with a wide range of investment aims either targeting specific geographic regions eg emerging markets or europe or specified industry sectors eg technology depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic market due to familiarity and the

the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic the first recorded professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes such as mutual funds were established in the dutch republic amsterdambased businessman abraham van ketwich also known as adriaan van ketwich is often credited as the originator of the worlds first mutual fund lawedit the term collective investment scheme is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of european union directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directives eec as amended by ec and ec typically known as ucits for short created an eu wide structure so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state the basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial products that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent with full disclosure about the nature of the terms in the united kingdom the primary statute is the financial services and markets act  where part xvii sections  to  deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate it states in section  that a “collective investment scheme” means any arrangements with respect to property of any description including money the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition holding management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income generic information—structureedit financial market participants credit unions insurance companies investment banks investment funds pension funds prime brokers trusts finance financial market participants corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e constitution and terminologyedit collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law by legal trust or by statute the nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction typically there is a fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions a fund administrator who manages the trading reconciliations valuation and unit pricing a board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws regulations and rules the shareholders or unitholders who own or have rights to the assets and associated income a marketing or distribution company to promote and sell sharesunits of the fund please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions net asset valueedit the net asset value or nav is the value of a vehicles assets minus the value of its liabilities the method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulationcitation needed openend fundedit an openend fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the funds net asset value each time money is invested new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price each time shares are redeemed the assets sold match the prevailing share price in this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets closedend fundedit a closedend fund issues a limited number of shares or units in an initial public offering or ipo or through private placement if shares are issued through an ipocitation needed they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces if demand for the shares is high they may trade at a premium to net asset value if demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value further share or unit offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price for listed funds the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility gearing and leverageedit some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments a process known as gearing or leverage if markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested however this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved if the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved this can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the uk in  availability and accessedit collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base publicavailability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposedcitation needed limitedavailability vehicles—are limited by laws regulations andor rules to experienced andor sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements privateavailability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund they are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax or estateplanning purposes limited durationedit some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date unit or share classedit many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units the underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the funds assets these differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes for example one class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission frontend load and might be called retail shares another class may be sold with no commission load direct to the public called direct shares still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions and called institutional shares in some cases by aggregating regular investments by many individuals a retirement plan such as a k plan may qualify to purchase institutional shares and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratioscitation needed even though no members of the plan would qualify individually these also include unit trusts generic information—advantagesedit diversity and riskedit one of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk capital risk by diversification an investment in a single equity may do well but it may collapse for investment or other reasons eg marconi if your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital by investing in a range of equities or other securities the capital risk is reduced the more diversified your capital the lower the capital risk this investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities however if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes to avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different nonperfectlycorrelated asset classes for example investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities reduced dealing costsedit if one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital affecting future profits generic information—disadvantagesedit costsedit the fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration this is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable performance based fee if the investor managed their own investments this cost would be avoided often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle often referred to as commission or load in the us this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year while this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost lack of choiceedit although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund loss of owners rightsedit if the investor holds shares directly he has the right to attend the companys annual general meeting and vote on important matters investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund styleedit investment aims and benchmarkingedit each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them the investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of income value investment or growth investment income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams often more established businesses growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth each strategy has its critics and proponents some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each funds are often distinguished by assetbased categories such as equity bonds property etc also perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes examples the largest markets—us japan europe uk and far east are often divided into smaller funds eg us large caps japanese smaller companies european growth uk mid caps etc themed funds—technology healthcare socially responsible funds in most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against eg ftse  this becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against active or passive managementedit the aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return ie better than inflation the philosophy used to manage the funds investment vary and two opposing views exist active management—active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies buying and selling investments with changing market conditions based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others passive management—passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio many passive funds are index funds which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole another example of passive management is the buy and hold method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset additionally some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns an example of active management success in  richard branson head of virgin publicly bet nicola horlick head of sg asset management that her sg uk growth fund would not beat the ftse  index nor his virgin index tracker fund over three years nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by  each year he lost and paid £ to charity alpha beta rsquared and standard deviationedit when analysing investment performance statistical measures are often used to compare funds these statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance alpha represents the funds return when the benchmarks return is  this shows the funds performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager the higher the alpha the better the manager alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by  unit this shows the funds sensitivity to changes in the market beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance rsquared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark values are between  and  perfect correlation is indicated by  and  indicates no correlation this measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference for example an index fund will have an rsquared with its benchmark index very close to  indicating close to perfect correlation the index funds fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling  standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the funds performance over a period of time the higher the figure the greater the variability of the funds performance high historical volatility may indicate high future volatility and therefore increased investment risk in a fund types of riskedit depending on the nature of the investment the type of investment risk will vary a common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital this risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk if the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value this is referred to as currency risk many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market eg commercial property or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk charging structures and feesedit fee typesedit for an openend fund there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople typically this fee is a percentage of the investment some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead this may be gradually disappearing after a number of years closedend funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions in the same manner as a stock trade the vehicle will charge an annual management charge or amc to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the

investment funds jump to navigation search the values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers an investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group these advantages include an ability to hire professional investment managers which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management benefit from economies of scale ie lower transaction costs increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk terminology varies with country but

aims either targeting specific geographic regions eg emerging markets or europe or specified industry sectors eg technology depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic

further information economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic the first recorded professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes such as mutual funds were established in the dutch republic amsterdambased businessman abraham van ketwich also known as adriaan van ketwich is often credited as the originator of the worlds first mutual fund lawedit the term collective investment scheme is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of european union directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directives eec as amended by ec and ec typically known as ucits for short created an eu wide structure so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state the basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial products that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent with full disclosure about the nature of the terms in the united kingdom the primary statute is the financial services and markets act  where part xvii sections  to  deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate it states in section  that a “collective investment scheme” means any arrangements with respect to property of any description including money the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition holding management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income generic information—structureedit financial market participants credit unions insurance companies investment banks investment funds pension funds prime brokers trusts finance financial market participants corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e constitution and terminologyedit collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law by legal trust or by statute the nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction typically there is a fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions a fund administrator who manages the trading reconciliations valuation and unit pricing a board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws regulations and rules the shareholders or unitholders who own or have rights to the assets and associated income a marketing or distribution company to promote and sell sharesunits of the fund please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions net asset valueedit the net asset value or nav is the value of a vehicles assets minus the value of its liabilities the method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulationcitation needed openend fundedit an openend fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the funds net asset value each time money is invested new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price each time shares are redeemed the assets sold match the prevailing share price in this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets closedend fundedit a closedend fund issues a limited number of shares or units in an initial public offering or ipo or through private placement if shares are issued through an ipocitation needed they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces if demand for the shares is high they may trade at a premium to net asset value if demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value further share or unit offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price for listed funds the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility gearing and leverageedit some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments a process known as gearing or leverage if markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested however this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved if the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved this can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the uk in  availability and accessedit collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base publicavailability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposedcitation needed limitedavailability vehicles—are limited by laws regulations andor rules to experienced andor sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements privateavailability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund they are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax or estateplanning purposes limited durationedit some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date unit or share classedit many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units the underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the funds assets these differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes for example one class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission frontend load and might be called retail shares another class may be sold with no commission load direct to the public called direct shares still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions and called institutional shares in some cases by aggregating regular investments by many individuals a retirement plan such as a k plan may qualify to purchase institutional shares and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratioscitation needed even though no members of the plan would qualify individually these also include unit trusts generic information—advantagesedit diversity and riskedit one of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk capital risk by diversification an investment in a single equity may do well but it may collapse for investment or other reasons eg marconi if your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital by investing in a range of equities or other securities the capital risk is reduced the more diversified your capital the lower the capital risk this investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities however if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes to avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different nonperfectlycorrelated asset classes for example investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities reduced dealing costsedit if one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital affecting future profits generic information—disadvantagesedit costsedit the fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration this is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable performance based fee if the investor managed their own investments this cost would be avoided often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle often referred to as commission or load in the us this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year while this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost lack of choiceedit although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund loss of owners rightsedit if the investor holds shares directly he has the right to attend the companys annual general meeting and vote on important matters investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund styleedit investment aims and benchmarkingedit each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them the investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of income value investment or growth investment income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams often more established businesses growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth each strategy has its critics and proponents some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each funds are often distinguished by assetbased categories such as equity bonds property etc also perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes examples the largest markets—us japan europe uk and far east are often divided into smaller funds eg us large caps japanese smaller companies european growth uk mid caps etc themed funds—technology healthcare socially responsible funds in most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against eg ftse  this becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against active or passive managementedit the aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return ie better than inflation the philosophy used to manage the funds investment vary and two opposing views exist active management—active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies buying and selling investments with changing market conditions based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others passive management—passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio many passive funds are index funds which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole another example of passive management is the buy and hold method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset additionally some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns an example of active management success in  richard branson head of virgin publicly bet nicola horlick head of sg asset management that her sg uk growth fund would not beat the ftse  index nor his virgin index tracker fund over three years nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by  each year he lost and paid £ to charity alpha beta rsquared and standard deviationedit when analysing investment performance statistical measures are often used to compare funds these statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance alpha represents the funds return when the benchmarks return is  this shows the funds performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager the higher the alpha the better the manager alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by  unit this shows the funds sensitivity to changes in the market beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance rsquared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark values are between  and  perfect correlation is indicated by  and  indicates no correlation this measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference for example an index fund will have an rsquared with its benchmark index very close to  indicating close to perfect correlation the index funds fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling  standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the funds performance over a period of time the higher the figure the greater the variability of the funds performance high historical volatility may indicate high future volatility and therefore increased investment risk in a fund types of riskedit depending on the nature of the investment the type of investment risk will vary a common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital this risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk if the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value this is referred to as currency risk many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market eg commercial property or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk charging structures and feesedit fee typesedit for an openend fund there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople typically this fee is a percentage of the investment some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead this may be gradually disappearing after a number of years closedend funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions in the same manner as a stock trade the vehicle will charge an annual management charge or amc to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager this may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved different unitshare classes may have different combinations of feescharges pricing modelsedit openended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced dual priced vehicles have a buying offer price and selling or bid price the buying price is higher than the selling price this difference is known as the spread or bidoffer spread the difference is typically  and may be varied by the vehicles manager to reflect changes in the market the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules the difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund the internal

further information economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic the first recorded professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes such as mutual funds were established in the dutch republic amsterdambased businessman abraham van ketwich also known as adriaan van ketwich is often credited as the originator of the worlds first mutual fund lawedit the term collective investment scheme is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of european union directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directives eec as amended by ec and ec typically known as ucits for short created an eu wide structure so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state the basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial products that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent with full disclosure about the nature of the terms in the united kingdom the primary statute is the financial services and markets act  where part xvii sections  to  deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate it states in section  that a “collective investment scheme” means any arrangements with respect to property of any description including money the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition holding management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income generic information—structureedit financial market participants credit unions insurance companies investment banks investment funds pension funds prime brokers trusts finance financial market participants corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e constitution and terminologyedit collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law by legal trust or by statute the nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction typically there is a fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions a fund administrator who manages the trading reconciliations valuation and unit pricing a board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws regulations and rules the shareholders or unitholders who own or have rights to the assets and associated income a marketing or distribution company to promote and sell sharesunits of the fund please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions net asset valueedit the net asset value or nav is the value of a vehicles assets minus the value of its liabilities the method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulationcitation needed openend fundedit an openend fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the funds net asset value each time money is invested new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price each time shares are redeemed the assets sold match the prevailing share price in this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets closedend fundedit a closedend fund issues a limited number of shares or units in an initial public offering or ipo or through private placement if shares are issued through an ipocitation needed they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces if demand for the shares is high they may trade at a premium to net asset value if demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value further share or unit offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price for listed funds the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility gearing and leverageedit some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments a process known as gearing or leverage if markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested however this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved if the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved this can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the uk in  availability and accessedit collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base publicavailability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposedcitation needed limitedavailability vehicles—are limited by laws regulations andor rules to experienced andor sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements privateavailability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund they are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax or estateplanning purposes limited durationedit some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date unit or share classedit many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units the underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the funds assets these differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes for example one class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission frontend load and might be called retail shares another class may be sold with no commission load direct to the public called direct shares still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions and called institutional shares in some cases by aggregating regular investments by many individuals a retirement plan such as a k plan may qualify to purchase institutional shares and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratioscitation needed even though no members of the plan would qualify individually these also include unit trusts generic information—advantagesedit diversity and riskedit one of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk capital risk by diversification an investment in a single equity may do well but it may collapse for investment or other reasons eg marconi if your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital by investing in a range of equities or other securities the capital risk is reduced the more diversified your capital the lower the capital risk this investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities however if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes to avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different nonperfectlycorrelated asset classes for example investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities reduced dealing costsedit if one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital affecting future profits generic information—disadvantagesedit costsedit the fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration this is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable performance based fee if the investor managed their own investments this cost would be avoided often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle often referred to as commission or load in the us this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year while this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost lack of choiceedit although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund loss of owners rightsedit if the investor holds shares directly he has the right to attend the companys annual general meeting and vote on important matters investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund styleedit investment aims and benchmarkingedit each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them the investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of income value investment or growth investment income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams often more established businesses growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth each strategy has its critics and proponents some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each funds are often distinguished by assetbased categories such as equity bonds property etc also perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes examples the largest markets—us japan europe uk and far east are often divided into smaller funds eg us large caps japanese smaller companies european growth uk mid caps etc themed funds—technology healthcare socially responsible funds in most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against eg ftse  this becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against active or passive managementedit the aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return ie better than inflation the philosophy used to manage the funds investment vary and two opposing views exist active management—active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies buying and selling investments with changing market conditions based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others passive management—passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio many passive funds are index funds which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole another example of passive management is the buy and hold method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset additionally some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns an example of active management success in  richard branson head of virgin publicly bet nicola horlick head of sg asset management that her sg uk growth fund would not beat the ftse  index nor his virgin index tracker fund over three years nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by  each year he lost and paid £ to charity alpha beta rsquared and standard deviationedit when analysing investment performance statistical measures are often used to compare funds these statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance alpha represents the funds return when the benchmarks return is  this shows the funds performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager the higher the alpha the better the manager alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by  unit this shows the funds sensitivity to changes in the market beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance rsquared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark values are between  and  perfect correlation is indicated by  and  indicates no correlation this measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference for example an index fund will have an rsquared with its benchmark index very close to  indicating close to perfect correlation the index funds fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling  standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the funds performance over a period of time the higher the figure the greater the variability of the funds performance high historical volatility may indicate high future volatility and therefore increased investment risk in a fund types of riskedit depending on the nature of the investment the type of investment risk will vary a common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital this risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk if the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value this is referred to as currency risk many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market eg commercial property or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk charging structures and feesedit fee typesedit for an openend fund there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople typically this fee is a percentage of the investment some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead this may be gradually disappearing after a number of years closedend funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions in the same manner as a stock trade the vehicle will charge an annual management charge or amc to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager this may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved different unitshare classes may have different combinations of feescharges pricing modelsedit openended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced dual priced vehicles have a buying offer price and selling or bid price the buying price is higher than the selling price this difference is known as the spread or bidoffer spread the difference is typically  and may be varied by the vehicles manager to reflect changes in the market the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules the difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund the internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests the manager sets a price for creation of unitsshares and for cancellation there is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices and the creation and offer prices the additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers when heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs adjusting the bidoffer prices closer to the cancellationcreation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions most unit trusts are dual priced single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for unitsshares and this price is the same if buying or selling as single prices vehicle cant adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists sicavs oeics and us mutual funds are single priced a dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large unmatched buy or sell orders for example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole diluting the fund the same is the case with large sell orders a dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole internationally recognised collective investmentsedit exchangetraded funds or etfs—a closedend fund

further information economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic the first recorded professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes such as mutual funds were established in the dutch republic amsterdambased businessman abraham van ketwich also known as adriaan van ketwich is often credited as the originator of the worlds first mutual fund lawedit the term collective investment scheme is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of european union directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directives eec as amended by ec and ec typically known as ucits for short created an eu wide structure so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state the basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial products that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent with full disclosure about the nature of the terms in the united kingdom the primary statute is the financial services and markets act  where part xvii sections  to  deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate it states in section  that a “collective investment scheme” means any arrangements with respect to property of any description including money the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition holding management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income generic information—structureedit financial market participants credit unions insurance companies investment banks investment funds pension funds prime brokers trusts finance financial market participants corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e constitution and terminologyedit collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law by legal trust or by statute the nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction typically there is a fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions a fund administrator who manages the trading reconciliations valuation and unit pricing a board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws regulations and rules the shareholders or unitholders who own or have rights to the assets and associated income a marketing or distribution company to promote and sell sharesunits of the fund please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions net asset valueedit the net asset value or nav is the value of a vehicles assets minus the value of its liabilities the method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulationcitation needed openend fundedit an openend fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the funds net asset value each time money is invested new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price each time shares are redeemed the assets sold match the prevailing share price in this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets closedend fundedit a closedend fund issues a limited number of shares or units in an initial public offering or ipo or through private placement if shares are issued through an ipocitation needed they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces if demand for the shares is high they may trade at a premium to net asset value if demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value further share or unit offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price for listed funds the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility gearing and leverageedit some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments a process known as gearing or leverage if markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested however this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved if the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved this can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the uk in  availability and accessedit collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base publicavailability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposedcitation needed limitedavailability vehicles—are limited by laws regulations andor rules to experienced andor sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements privateavailability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund they are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax or estateplanning purposes limited durationedit some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date unit or share classedit many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units the underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the funds assets these differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes for example one class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission frontend load and might be called retail shares another class may be sold with no commission load direct to the public called direct shares still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions and called institutional shares in some cases by aggregating regular investments by many individuals a retirement plan such as a k plan may qualify to purchase institutional shares and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratioscitation needed even though no members of the plan would qualify individually these also include unit trusts generic information—advantagesedit diversity and riskedit one of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk capital risk by diversification an investment in a single equity may do well but it may collapse for investment or other reasons eg marconi if your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital by investing in a range of equities or other securities the capital risk is reduced the more diversified your capital the lower the capital risk this investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities however if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes to avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different nonperfectlycorrelated asset classes for example investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities reduced dealing costsedit if one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital affecting future profits generic information—disadvantagesedit costsedit the fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration this is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable performance based fee if the investor managed their own investments this cost would be avoided often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle often referred to as commission or load in the us this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year while this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost lack of choiceedit although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund loss of owners rightsedit if the investor holds shares directly he has the right to attend the companys annual general meeting and vote on important matters investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund styleedit investment aims and benchmarkingedit each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them the investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of income value investment or growth investment income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams often more established businesses growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth each strategy has its critics and proponents some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each funds are often distinguished by assetbased categories such as equity bonds property etc also perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes examples the largest markets—us japan europe uk and far east are often divided into smaller funds eg us large caps japanese smaller companies european growth uk mid caps etc themed funds—technology healthcare socially responsible funds in most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against eg ftse  this becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against active or passive managementedit the aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return ie better than inflation the philosophy used to manage the funds investment vary and two opposing views exist active management—active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies buying and selling investments with changing market conditions based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others passive management—passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio many passive funds are index funds which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole another example of passive management is the buy and hold method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset additionally some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns an example of active management success in  richard branson head of virgin publicly bet nicola horlick head of sg asset management that her sg uk growth fund would not beat the ftse  index nor his virgin index tracker fund over three years nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by  each year he lost and paid £ to charity alpha beta rsquared and standard deviationedit when analysing investment performance statistical measures are often used to compare funds these statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance alpha represents the funds return when the benchmarks return is  this shows the funds performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager the higher the alpha the better the manager alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by  unit this shows the funds sensitivity to changes in the market beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance rsquared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark values are between  and  perfect correlation is indicated by  and  indicates no correlation this measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference for example an index fund will have an rsquared with its benchmark index very close to  indicating close to perfect correlation the index funds fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling  standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the funds performance over a period of time the higher the figure the greater the variability of the funds performance high historical volatility may indicate high future volatility and therefore increased investment risk in a fund types of riskedit depending on the nature of the investment the type of investment risk will vary a common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital this risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk if the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value this is referred to as currency risk many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market eg commercial property or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk charging structures and feesedit fee typesedit for an openend fund there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople typically this fee is a percentage of the investment some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead this may be gradually disappearing after a number of years closedend funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions in the same manner as a stock trade the vehicle will charge an annual management charge or amc to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager this may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved different unitshare classes may have different combinations of feescharges pricing modelsedit openended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced dual priced vehicles have a buying offer price and selling or bid price the buying price is higher than the selling price this difference is known as the spread or bidoffer spread the difference is typically  and may be varied by the vehicles manager to reflect changes in the market the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules the difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund the internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests the manager sets a price for creation of unitsshares and for cancellation there is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices and the creation and offer prices the additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers when heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs adjusting the bidoffer prices closer to the cancellationcreation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions most unit trusts are dual priced single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for unitsshares and this price is the same if buying or selling as single prices vehicle cant adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists sicavs oeics and us mutual funds are single priced a dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large unmatched buy or sell orders for example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole diluting the fund the same is the case with large sell orders a dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole internationally recognised collective investmentsedit exchangetraded funds or etfs—a closedend fund

investments this cost would be avoided often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle often referred to as commission or load in the us this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year while this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost lack of choiceedit although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund loss of owners rightsedit if the investor holds shares directly he has the right to attend the companys annual general meeting and vote on important matters investors in a collective investment vehicle often have none of the rights connected with individual investments within the fund styleedit investment aims and benchmarkingedit each fund has a defined investment goal to describe the remit of the investment manager and to help investors decide if the fund is right for them the investment aims will typically fall into the broad categories of income value investment or growth investment income or value based investment tends to select stocks with strong income streams often more established businesses growth investment selects stocks that tend to reinvest their income to generate growth each strategy has its critics and proponents some prefer a blend approach using aspects of each funds are often distinguished by assetbased categories such as equity bonds property etc also perhaps most commonly funds are divided by their geographic markets or themes examples the largest markets—us japan europe uk and far east are often divided into smaller funds eg us large caps japanese smaller companies european growth uk mid caps etc themed funds—technology healthcare socially responsible funds in most instances whatever the investment aim the fund manager will select an appropriate index or combination of indices to measure its performance against eg ftse  this becomes the benchmark to measure success or failure against active or passive managementedit the aim of most funds is to make money by investing in assets to obtain a real return ie better than inflation the philosophy used to manage the funds investment vary and two opposing views exist active management—active managers seek to outperform the market as a whole by selectively holding securities according to an investment strategy therefore they employ dynamic portfolio strategies buying and selling investments with changing market conditions based on their belief that particular individual holdings or sections of the market will perform better than others passive management—passive managers stick to a portfolio strategy determined at outset of the fund and not varied thereafter aiming to minimize the ongoing costs of maintaining the portfolio many passive funds are index funds which attempt to replicate the performance of a market index by holding securities proportionally to their value in the market as a whole another example of passive management is the buy and hold method used by many traditional unit investment trusts where the portfolio is fixed from outset additionally some funds use a hybrid management strategy of enhanced indexing in which the manager minimizes costs by broadly following a passive indexing strategy but has the discretion to actively deviate from the index in the hopes of earning modestly higher returns an example of active management success in  richard branson head of virgin publicly bet nicola horlick head of sg asset management that her sg uk growth fund would not beat the ftse  index nor his virgin index tracker fund over three years nor achieve its stated aim to beat the index by  each year he lost and paid £ to charity alpha beta rsquared and standard deviationedit when analysing investment performance statistical measures are often used to compare funds these statistical measures are often reduced to a single figure representing an aspect of past performance alpha represents the funds return when the benchmarks return is  this shows the funds performance relative to the benchmark and can demonstrate the value added by the fund manager the higher the alpha the better the manager alpha investment strategies tend to favour stock selection methods to achieve growth beta represents an estimate of how much the fund will move if its benchmark moves by  unit this shows the funds sensitivity to changes in the market beta investment strategies tend to favour asset allocation models to achieve outperformance rsquared is a measure of the association between a fund and its benchmark values are between  and  perfect correlation is indicated by  and  indicates no correlation this measure is useful in determining if the fund manager is adding value in their investment choices or acting as a closet tracker mirroring the market and making little difference for example an index fund will have an rsquared with its benchmark index very close to  indicating close to perfect correlation the index funds fees and tracking error prevent the correlation from ever equalling  standard deviation is a measure of volatility of the funds performance over a period of time the higher the figure the greater the variability of the funds performance high historical volatility may indicate high future volatility and therefore increased investment risk in a fund types of riskedit depending on the nature of the investment the type of investment risk will vary a common concern with any investment is that you may lose the money you invest—your capital this risk is therefore often referred to as capital risk if the assets you invest in are held in another currency there is a risk that currency movements alone may affect the value this is referred to as currency risk many forms of investment may not be readily salable on the open market eg commercial property or the market has a small capacity and investments may take time to sell assets that are easily sold are termed liquid therefore this type of risk is termed liquidity risk charging structures and feesedit fee typesedit for an openend fund there may be an initial charge levied on the purchase of units or shares this covers dealing costs and commissions paid to intermediaries or salespeople typically this fee is a percentage of the investment some vehicles waive the initial charge and apply an exit charge instead this may be gradually disappearing after a number of years closedend funds traded on an exchange are subject to brokerage commissions in the same manner as a stock trade the vehicle will charge an annual management charge or amc to cover the cost of administering the vehicle and remunerating the investment manager this may be a flat rate based on the value of the assets or a performance related fee based on a predefined target being achieved different unitshare classes may have different combinations of feescharges pricing modelsedit openended vehicles are either dual priced or single priced dual priced vehicles have a buying offer price and selling or bid price the buying price is higher than the selling price this difference is known as the spread or bidoffer spread the difference is typically  and may be varied by the vehicles manager to reflect changes in the market the amount of variation may be limited by the vehicles rules or regulatory rules the difference between the buying and selling price includes initial charge for entering the fund the internal workings of a fund are more complicated than this description suggests the manager sets a price for creation of unitsshares and for cancellation there is a differential between the cancellation and bid prices and the creation and offer prices the additional units are created are place in the managers box for future purchasers when heavy selling occurs units are liquidated from the managers box to protect the existing investors from the increased dealing costs adjusting the bidoffer prices closer to the cancellationcreation prices allows the manager to protect the interest of the existing investors in changing market conditions most unit trusts are dual priced single priced vehicles notionally have a single price for unitsshares and this price is the same if buying or selling as single prices vehicle cant adjust the difference between the buying and selling price to allow for market conditions another mechanism the dilution levy exists sicavs oeics and us mutual funds are single priced a dilution levy can be charged at the discretion of the fund manager to offset the cost of market transactions resulting from large unmatched buy or sell orders for example if the volume of purchases outweigh the volume of sales in a particular trading period the fund manager will have to go to the market to buy more of the assets underlying the fund incurring a brokerage fee in the process and having an adverse effect on the fund as a whole diluting the fund the same is the case with large sell orders a dilution levy is therefore applied where appropriate and paid for by the investor in order that large single transactions do not reduce the value of the fund as a whole internationally recognised collective investmentsedit exchangetraded funds or etfs—a closedend fund

investment funds jump to navigation search the values and performance of collective funds are listed in newspapers an investment fund is a way of investing money alongside other investors in order to benefit from the inherent advantages of working as part of a group these advantages include an ability to hire professional investment managers which may potentially be able to offer better returns and more adequate risk management benefit from economies of scale ie lower transaction costs increase the asset diversification to reduce some unsystematic risk terminology varies with country but

aims either targeting specific geographic regions eg emerging markets or europe or specified industry sectors eg technology depending on the country there is normally a bias towards the domestic

further information economic history of the dutch republic and financial history of the dutch republic the first recorded professionally managed investment funds or collective investment schemes such as mutual funds were established in the dutch republic amsterdambased businessman abraham van ketwich also known as adriaan van ketwich is often credited as the originator of the worlds first mutual fund lawedit the term collective investment scheme is a legal concept deriving initially from a set of european union directives to regulate mutual fund investment and management the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities directives eec as amended by ec and ec typically known as ucits for short created an eu wide structure so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state the basic aim of collective investment scheme regulation is that the financial products that are sold to the public are sufficiently transparent with full disclosure about the nature of the terms in the united kingdom the primary statute is the financial services and markets act  where part xvii sections  to  deal with the requirements for a collective investment scheme to operate it states in section  that a “collective investment scheme” means any arrangements with respect to property of any description including money the purpose or effect of which is to enable persons taking part in the arrangements whether by becoming owners of the property or any part of it or otherwise to participate in or receive profits or income arising from the acquisition holding management or disposal of the property or sums paid out of such profits or income generic information—structureedit financial market participants credit unions insurance companies investment banks investment funds pension funds prime brokers trusts finance financial market participants corporate finance personal finance public finance banks and banking financial regulation fund governance v t e constitution and terminologyedit collective investment vehicles may be formed under company law by legal trust or by statute the nature of the vehicle and its limitations are often linked to its constitutional nature and the associated tax rules for the type of structure within a given jurisdiction typically there is a fund manager or investment manager who manages the investment decisions a fund administrator who manages the trading reconciliations valuation and unit pricing a board of directors or trustees who safeguards the assets and ensures compliance with laws regulations and rules the shareholders or unitholders who own or have rights to the assets and associated income a marketing or distribution company to promote and sell sharesunits of the fund please see below for general information on specific forms of vehicles in different jurisdictions net asset valueedit the net asset value or nav is the value of a vehicles assets minus the value of its liabilities the method for calculating this varies between vehicle types and jurisdiction and can be subject to complex regulationcitation needed openend fundedit an openend fund is equitably divided into shares which vary in price in direct proportion to the variation in value of the funds net asset value each time money is invested new shares or units are created to match the prevailing share price each time shares are redeemed the assets sold match the prevailing share price in this way there is no supply or demand created for shares and they remain a direct reflection of the underlying assets closedend fundedit a closedend fund issues a limited number of shares or units in an initial public offering or ipo or through private placement if shares are issued through an ipocitation needed they are then traded on an exchange or directly through the fund manager to create a secondary market subject to market forces if demand for the shares is high they may trade at a premium to net asset value if demand is low they may trade at a discount to net asset value further share or unit offerings may be made by the vehicle if demand is high although this may affect the share price for listed funds the added element of market forces tends to amplify the performance of the fund increasing investment risk through increased volatility gearing and leverageedit some collective investment vehicles have the power to borrow money to make further investments a process known as gearing or leverage if markets are growing rapidly this can allow the vehicle to take advantage of the growth to a greater extent than if only the subscribed contributions were invested however this premise only works if the cost of the borrowing is less than the increased growth achieved if the borrowing costs are more than the growth achieved a net loss is achieved this can greatly increase the investment risk of the fund by increased volatility and exposure to increased capital risk gearing was a major contributory factor in the collapse of the split capital investment trust debacle in the uk in  availability and accessedit collective investment vehicles vary in availability depending on their intended investor base publicavailability vehicles—are available to most investors within the jurisdiction they are offered some restrictions on age and size of investment may be imposedcitation needed limitedavailability vehicles—are limited by laws regulations andor rules to experienced andor sophisticated investors and often have high minimum investment requirements privateavailability vehicles—may be limited to family members or whomever set up the fund they are not publicly traded and may be arranged for tax or estateplanning purposes limited durationedit some vehicles are designed to have a limited term with enforced redemption of shares or units on a specified date unit or share classedit many collective investment vehicles split the fund into multiple classes of shares or units the underlying assets of each class are effectively pooled for the purposes of investment management but classes typically differ in the fees and expenses paid out of the funds assets these differences are supposed to reflect different costs involved in servicing investors in various classes for example one class may be sold through a stockbroker or financial adviser with an initial commission frontend load and might be called retail shares another class may be sold with no commission load direct to the public called direct shares still a third class might have a high minimum investment limit and only be open to financial institutions and called institutional shares in some cases by aggregating regular investments by many individuals a retirement plan such as a k plan may qualify to purchase institutional shares and gain the benefit of their typically lower expense ratioscitation needed even though no members of the plan would qualify individually these also include unit trusts generic information—advantagesedit diversity and riskedit one of the main advantages of collective investment is the reduction in investment risk capital risk by diversification an investment in a single equity may do well but it may collapse for investment or other reasons eg marconi if your money is invested in such a failed holding you could lose your capital by investing in a range of equities or other securities the capital risk is reduced the more diversified your capital the lower the capital risk this investment principle is often referred to as spreading risk collective investments by their nature tend to invest in a range of individual securities however if the securities are all in a similar type of asset class or market sector then there is a systematic risk that all the shares could be affected by adverse market changes to avoid this systematic risk investment managers may diversify into different nonperfectlycorrelated asset classes for example investors might hold their assets in equal parts in equities and fixed income securities reduced dealing costsedit if one investor had to buy a large number of direct investments the amount this person would be able to invest in each holding is likely to be small dealing costs are normally based on the number and size of each transaction therefore the overall dealing costs would take a large chunk out of the capital affecting future profits generic information—disadvantagesedit costsedit the fund manager managing the investment decisions on behalf of the investors will of course expect remuneration this is often taken directly from the fund assets as a fixed percentage each year or sometimes a variable performance based fee if the investor managed their own investments this cost would be avoided often the cost of advice given by a stockbroker or financial adviser is built into the vehicle often referred to as commission or load in the us this charge may be applied at the start of the plan or as an ongoing percentage of the fund value each year while this cost will diminish your returns it could be argued that it reflects a separate payment for an advice service rather than a detrimental feature of collective investment vehicles indeed it is often possible to purchase units or shares directly from the providers without bearing this cost lack of choiceedit although the investor can choose the type of fund to invest in they have no control over the choice of individual holdings that make up the fund loss of owners rightsedit if the investor
