directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

measurement tam a joint venture of the former competitors nielsen and kantar media research which for years has provided the only tv audience measurement system in india wpp plc was listed among the defendants as the holding group of kantar and imrb ndtvs lawsuit filed in the new york state supreme court under the foreign corrupt practices act and seeking  billion for negligence and hundreds of millions for interference and breach of fiduciary duty cited a public conversation between vikram chandra ceo of ndtv and martin sorrell ceo of wpp in which chandra had described ways in which the system was prone to tampering and bribery his request for a halt to the publication of the allegedly compromised data was unsuccessful wpp responded that the lawsuit had not been served on wpp or any of its operating companies the new york court had no jurisdiction in the case and that it would file for dismissal seeking legal costs and that it was considering a lawsuit against ndtv for defamation a threat which ndtv in turn called baseless the motion to dismiss was filed a week later with the statement in its memorandum of law that this case is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the plaintiff a television station in new delhi india to drum up media coverage in india to divert attention from the real reasons its programmes have had low audience ratings and its financial performance has been abysmal for five years  new delhi tv has crossed the globe and come to new york state supreme court to complain about an indian company tam and how it measures the ratings of television programmes in india the motion to dismiss is to be decided by the court on  december  nielsen later filed its own petition for dismissal writing that ndtv attempts to transform a potential contract claim against tam into tort and oral contract claims against the nielsen defendants nothing in the law supports such a magic trick simply put ndtv fails to allege a legal duty independent of a contract and fails to allege all of the elements needed to support each cause of action referencesedit  a b c preliminary results  pdf wpp plc retrieved  april    a b at a glance wpp plc retrieved
