first base to put out colorado rockies first baseman wilin rosario in the ninth inning of a baseball game in denver the stolen base has been stolen from much of baseball an afterthought when spring training starts next week sabermetrics have played a huge role in the steals decline when a hitter steps into a batters box and a runner takes a lead managers and coaches know the pitchers delivery time to home plate and the catchers pop time  the secondplus lag between the ball hitting the mitt and it touching the middle infielders glove ap photodavid zalubowski file midwest city — the first pitch was impressive enough a highs fastball followed by that electric smile the glove popped with a special sound each pitch it didnt matter the foot righthander on the mound was roughly  pounds overweight jt realmuto was amazed there stood jose fernandez a teenager at the time full of energy “he was just a chubby ol yearold kid but he was throwing gas” realmuto said “he always had that nasty slider he was by far probably the best pitcher i ever caught stuffwise” five months after fernandezs tragic death in a boating accident and just weeks after royals star yordano ventura died in a car accident in the dominican republic baseball returns to work this week but there will be heavy hearts “itll definitely be tough the first week or so” realmuto told the oklahoman before it was revealed the marlins would wear a patch this season to honor fernandez for realmuto and fernandez there was a special bond the two were considered bright prospects when they met they quickly became friends too realmuto was drafted from carl albert high school in the third round of the  draft then a shortstop who decimated oklahoma pitching he was immediately converted to catcher with little to no experience behind the plate he had to learn to call and manage games he had to learn his pitchers who in the lower levels make learning to catch challenging with impressive velocity and breaking balls but little to no control in  he met fernandez “he was awesome just happy as can be always in a good mood — apart from him being a dominating pitcher” realmuto said “he was just the friendliest kid youll ever meet you always knew he was there he was just one of those guys that you never missed” they worked a lot together in class a the following spring training they worked even more together with both ticketed to open in double a fernandez never pitched in the minors that season he jumped to miami and ultimately was named rookie of the year realmuto followed a year later and fernandez was the lone pitcher on staff realmuto knew and as realmuto grew behind the plate he developed an ability to help keep fernandez out of trouble on the field fernandezs smile and laugh upset opponents following a strikeout he playfully threw gum at umpires or sunflower seeds at fans he was loud in the clubhouse “he never took anything too serious” realmuto said “it wasnt him trying to show anybody up it was him legitimately just always having a good time” but pitching fernandez did take seriously realmuto noticed something special in the dugout when fernandezs day was finished its how he wants to remember his friend “after a good game you could tell he was just the happiest person on the planet” realmuto said you might also be interested in show more jacob unruh twitter google plus jacob unruh

calculated that the senate should bring it to the house as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill instead of trying direct introduction into the house although wellplanned alberts

governor of maryland agnew resigned as vice president and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges this event put albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties should that office become vacant under the provisions of the twentyfifth amendment to the united states constitution nixon nominated republican house minority leader gerald r ford to succeed agnew as vice president in october  as the watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against richard nixon began it quickly became apparent that if nixon resigned or was impeached from office before ford was confirmed by both houses albert would become acting president under the presidential succession act of  albert would have been forced to resign from the office of speaker as well as the house this was the first occasion since the ratification of the twentyfifth amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office as speaker of the house albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach nixon and had the ability to prevent any vice presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the house this meant albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself acting president however albert concluded that as a democrat he had no right to inherit a presidency that had been won by a republican ticket in  he later stated that if he had become acting president by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the house and senate had confirmed a republican vice president the vice presidency was vacant for about seven weeks ford was confirmed and sworn in as vice president in december  nixon resigned on august   and the office of vice president was once more left vacant when ford was sworn in as president that day after former new york governor nelson rockefeller was nominated by ford then confirmed and sworn into office as vice president in december any issue of presidential succession was moot a different issue arose during alberts last term in office when he was confronted with the tongsun park scandal he was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of south korean intelligence albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts which

of trying direct introduction into the house although wellplanned alberts efforts on behalf of the medicare bill were not successful at that time after the kennedy assassination albert worked to change house rules so that the majority democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of congress under president lyndon b johnson the changes included more majority leverage over the house rules committee and stronger majority membership influence in the house ways and means committee with these changes in place albert was able to push through the medicare bill known as the social

legislative agenda in the house particularly with health care legislation medicare the federal program of hospital insurance for persons  and older was initially proposed by the kennedy administration as an amendment to the social security program albert knew the bill had insufficient congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten key republicans and eight key southern democrats he advised president kennedy to seek senate passage of the measure first albert calculated that the senate should bring it to the house as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill instead of trying direct introduction into the house although wellplanned alberts efforts on behalf of the medicare bill were not successful at that time after the kennedy assassination albert worked to change house rules so that the majority democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of congress under president lyndon b johnson the changes included more majority leverage over the house rules committee and stronger majority membership influence in the house ways and means committee with these changes in place albert was able to push through the medicare bill known as the social security act of  and he shepherded other pieces of johnsons great society program through congress albert also chaired the infamous  democratic national convention in chicago the convention was one of the most chaotic conventions in american history riots and protests raged outside the convention venue and disorder reigned among convention delegates tasked with leading the party after the assassinations of robert f kennedy and martin luther king jr the increasing casualties of the vietnam war and johnsons decision to withdraw from the race for his partys presidential nomination after a bruising and humiliating new hampshire primary speaker of us house of representativesedit when speaker john w mccormack retired in january  during the second half of richard nixons first term as president albert was elected speaker of the house of representatives alberts chief of staff was charles ward a respected washington dc leader and former newspaper editor from oklahoma as the watergate scandal developed in  albert as speaker referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the house judiciary committee for debate and study also in  albert appointed felda looper as the first female page in the house of representatives watergate crisisedit in  during alberts second term as speaker and nixons second term as president vice president spiro agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was governor of maryland agnew resigned as vice president and eventually pleaded nolo contendere to the charges this event put albert next in line to assume the presidential powers and duties should that office become vacant under the provisions of the twentyfifth amendment to the united states constitution nixon nominated republican house minority leader gerald r ford to succeed agnew as vice president in october  as the watergate crisis began to unfold and the impeachment process against richard nixon began it quickly became apparent that if nixon resigned or was impeached from office before ford was confirmed by both houses albert would become acting president under the presidential succession act of  albert would have been forced to resign from the office of speaker as well as the house this was the first occasion since the ratification of the twentyfifth amendment in which it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office as speaker of the house albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach nixon and had the ability to prevent any vice presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the house this meant albert could have theoretically maneuvered to make himself acting president however albert concluded that as a democrat he had no right to inherit a presidency that had been won by a republican ticket in  he later stated that if he had become acting president by succession that it would be in the national interest to resign immediately after the house and senate had confirmed a republican vice president the vice presidency was vacant for about seven weeks ford was confirmed and sworn in as vice president in december  nixon resigned on august   and the office of vice president was once more left vacant when ford was sworn in as president that day after former new york governor nelson rockefeller was nominated by ford then confirmed and sworn into office as vice president in december any issue of presidential succession was moot a different issue arose during alberts last term in office when he was confronted with the tongsun park scandal he was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of south korean intelligence albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted to have received only token gifts which he disclosed he decided to retire at the end of the th congress in january  and after leaving the house he turned the gifts over to the general services administration as required by law albert was never charged with a crime retirementedit official portrait as speaker after he left washington albert returned to mcalester turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns he died there on february   albert published his memoirs with help from university professor danney goble entitled little giant university of oklahoma press  isbn  a postretirement editorial in the new york times said he was  a conciliator and seeker of consensus a patient persuader    trusted for his fairness and integrity after
