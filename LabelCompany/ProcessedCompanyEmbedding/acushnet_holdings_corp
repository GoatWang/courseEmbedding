currency basis since  and  of our net sales for the three months ended march   and  respectively were generated outside of the united states we use net sales on a constant currency basis to evaluate the sales performance of our business in period over period comparisons and for forecasting our business going forward constant currency information allows us to estimate what our sales performance would have been without changes in foreign currency exchange rates this information is calculated by taking the current period local currency sales and translating them into us dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable prior period this constant currency information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with gaap our presentation of constant currency information may not be consistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies we primarily use adjusted ebitda on a consolidated basis to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies assess our consolidated operating performance and make decisions regarding pricing of our products go to market execution and costs to incur across our business we define adjusted ebitda in a manner consistent with the term consolidated ebitda as it is defined in the credit agreement dated as of april   among

attributable to acushnet holdings corp as a measure of our operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap in addition adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items or affected by similar nonrecurring items adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider such measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under gaap our definition and calculation of adjusted ebitda is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to acushnet holdings corp see results of operations we also use adjusted ebitda margin which measures our adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales because our management uses it to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies assess our consolidated operating performance and make decisions regarding pricing of our products go to market execution and costs to incur across our business we present adjusted ebitda margin as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it excludes the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance by presenting adjusted ebitda margin we provide a basis for comparison of our business operations between different periods by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance adjusted ebitda margin is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap it should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap in addition
