randle continues to prove hes nbaready by keith schlosser  oct    am share anthony gruppuso keith schlosser snytv twitter  archive as derrick rose remains in los angeles for the duration of his trial things are looking up for chasson randle the longer rose is absent the more likely the youngster is to make the knicks opening night roster though anything is possible it doesnt appear the knicks are concerned rose will miss major regular season time even so randle continues to use the opportunity afforded to him to prove hes an nba player he undoubtedly plays the knicks desired brand of basketball the stanford product already has an aptitude for the triangle but can still push the tempo its a perfect compromise for what new york is trying to do randle may not be a natural playmaker but his ability to penetrate helps spread the floor whats more hes quite the aggressor on the defensive end randle is hungry and it shows serving as the knicks backup point guard behind brandon jennings has been quite the opportunity and randle hasnt disappointed yet through three games hes averaged  points on  percent from the field and  percent from deep and  steals new york may have initially had plans to cut and jettison randle to westchester following camp but hes playing so well at this point that another nba team would be hard pressed not to pick him up instead the knicks may not want to take that chance randle is obviously benefitting from the time and attention rose has not been able to get in games and practices as such hes learning the system and developing a familiarity with his teammates that rose may not necessarily have just yet randle can provide stability at the point guard position especially as the regular season starts and the team looks to fully acclimate rose into the offense again in the meantime the youngster is showing potential and helping ensure the team doesnt miss a beat when rose returns hell obviously be the priority nevertheless having three point guards will also give new york the flexibility to experiment with dual floor general lineups something jeff hornacek very much enjoyed doing as coach of the phoenix suns initially it was surprising to see the knicks only sign rose and jennings most nba teams carry three point guards on the roster randle has proven hes a big league player and can be depended on in such a role regardless of the reason roses absence has given the knicks a glimpse into why it is so crucial to have that backup manpower at the one rose and jennings have both fought off major injuries and should they experience something like that again the knicks would be left rather vulnerable having to depend on just one or the other randle should have an inside track at making the roster at this point he fills a desperate need more so than ron baker or sasha vujacic luckily for randle hes continued to capitalize on the opportunity given the knicks need him and hes given them every reason to believe in
