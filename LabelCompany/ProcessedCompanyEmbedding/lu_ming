pleasant surprise  lu ming tang elixir de vie bio shield eye concentrate may   by orchidspeonies in reviews in a previous blog post i mentioned that i was trialling a few products from new chinesefrench skincare brand lu ming tang i discovered this brand at an expat expo and whilst i was partially a little bit skeptical at first as i had never heard of the brand but the other part was very curious as the packaging was so cute i thought i would give it a go as the brand representative was so lovely and passionate about the products and took her time to explain everything to me  from the concept to each of the products i am so glad the mr pushed me to try the products as i actually quite like a few of them so far i have been testing these on and off for the last week one product in particular is a stand out in the range for me as mentioned here lu ming tang is the creation of french expat marie amiand who lived in shanghai for  years her story is that she was a beauty consultant for many international luxury skincare brands and whilst in shanghai her skin started to feel the effects of the pollution and the environmental stress around her with these concerns in mind she did some research discovered the amazing benefits of tea and lu ming tang was born well i am pleased to say i have been playing around with the products for about a week now and the eye concentrate in particular has been such a pleasant surprise i really really enjoy using it and out of the all the products in my discovery box that i purchased this is the one i have been using the most and often reach for i never thought i would enjoy it as much as i have as i already have two other eye treatments i havent really toyed around with eye creams so much as i am finding them very hard to use up you just need the smallest amount i am however really happy to now have this on my rotation what is itthe lu ming tang elixir de vie bio shield eye concentrate is such a handful to say but it is quite simply an eye creamtreatment it is a bit more thicker in consistency than the eye creams that i own sunday riley start over and verso skincare the super eye concentrate but a bit thinner than that of the la mer eye concentrate if that gives you an idea of the viscosity  the beautiful packaging of the lu ming tang elixir de vie bio shield eye concentrate what does it dothe elixir de vie is one of those eye creams that seem to do a bit of everything  minimises fine lines diminish the appearance of dark circles protect the eye area from the effects of pollution using powerful antioxidants and be a antiageing work horse it uses the intense power of black puer tea sourced from the xishuangbanna mountains in the yunnan province the tea trees here are apparently more than  years old the eye concentrate also uses other forms of antioxidants in their formula to fight free radicals in pollution such as genetian flowers from france acerola berries and yarrow extract the description from lu ming tang  website is the followingour concentrate reduces the look of visible signs of eye ageing helps ironout fine lines and wrinkles fights uneven skin tonethis powerhouse of yunnan pu’er tea with revitalising vitamins and antioxidants stimulates exceptional rejuvenationthe eye contour looks fresh more rested more radiant and youthfullookingit also claims to be suitable for all skin types  ingredientsthe ingredients listing for this is not online which is what i seem to find quite common on many of the asian websites its so annoying when i need to decipher whether or not i should buy something they do however have a full ingredient listing on the box of the product water triethlyhexanoin olea europaea olive fruit oil butyrospermum parkii shea butter pentelene glycol cetearyl alcohol glycerin glyceryl strearate peg stearate koucha ekisu puer tea gentiana lutea root extract malpighia emarginata acerola fruit extract achillea millefolium extract neurobiox camellia sinesis leaf extract green tea chlorophyllincopper complex chlorophyll hyrdoxypropylcycodexterin ferulic acid tocopherol beeswax bisabolol acrylatesc alkylacrylate crosspolymer butylene glycol xantham gum disodiem edta ethylhexyglycerin sodium hydroxide fragrance phenoxyethanoli had a quick look at the ingredients on cosdna and all in all the ingredients listing looks okay for me nothing too alarming there are a few acne triggers such as the olive oil beeswax and the shea butter peg  chlorophyllincopper complex a colour additive and sodium hydroxide all rate  and fragrance is rated  for safety i am however quite impressed with the amount of different antioxidants in this ingredient list  my thoughtsearlier on i did mention how pleasantly surprised i am with this product the main reason being is that i found that it really did diminish the look of dark circles around my eye area most of my other eye creams i have purchased i have been using as a preventative measure as ageing around the eye area isnt a huge concern for me as of yet  i am  dark circles and puffiness around the eyes are probably my main concerns and whilst those eye creams that i do already own do help a bit more so the puffiness the results i got from the lu ming tang elixir de vie were much more noticeable  especially in the area of dark circles the elixir de vie consistency is a little bit more thicker than i am generally use to but i do know that some eye creams are this sort of texture i find that the tiniest bit does go a very long way  a grain of rice and i do need to massage the cream in for it to absorb it also does take a little longer for the cream to sink in which is fine for the evening but a bit of a pain in the morning if you are in a rush i would love to use this in some mornings as the effect it has underneath my eyes is noticeable and the wait and the process is something i am willing to forfeit as i am much better applying eye creams than i am at concealer haha i was also quite worried when using this at first due to the thickness of the product and the use of shea butter in the eye area  mainly because i have heard horror stories about using heavy products and millia i am happy to say i have been using this on and off for about a week now and there are no signs as of yet and touch wood it stays like that slightly thicker in consistency than i am used to but some great results for me with this cream in terms of wrinkles and fine lines i do have some smaller lines underneath my eyes the plumping action from this eye cream does help minimise the tiny lines i cant however comment on wrinkles due to the fact i dont really have any and if i did i havent been using this product long enough to gauge a difference as mentioned before my main concerns are really just puffiness and the dark circlesi am so sorryas mentioned in the ingredients section i am really quite impressed with the different types of antioxidants that this eye concentrate uses puer black tea is actually a form of fermented tea and is quite unique to the yunnan province in china drinking the tea is said to have lots of different health benefits and one of these is to detoxify the system and  it is also a very powerful inflammatory the elixir de vie also uses green tea extract the acerola berry extract ferulic acid tocopherol vitamin e and genetian flower extract all which do have antioxidant free radical fighting effects and also serve as antiinflammatories the company does put their money where their mouth is when it talks about the use of antioxidants and fighting off the effects of pollution which is nice to see the brand also uses some ingredients like the neurobiox which natural active that is developed from the yarrow plant this ingredient helps with resurfacing the skin antiageing and minimising pore size it is nice to see that the product does include the best of both the eastern and western worlds in its creation black puer tea is used in the elixir de vie bio shield eye concentrate image source httplumingtangcomcnenindexphp my only other gripe with this product other than consistency is the packaging  it is partially due to the fact i am quite spoilt though in that both of my other eye treatments are of the pump variety the packaging of this product is in a jar and due to hygiene reasons i do need to scoop out the tiniest amount with a spatula i wish jar packaging was banned sometimes haha in a jar you do get ml of product which is standard for most eye creams and a little goes a long way as you just need the smallest amount repurchase yay or nayat this point in time i have two other eye creams which i am struggling to use up in my rotation so a repurchase wouldnt be anytime soon if i did have to choose what to repurchase in the eye creams i own this would most likely be one of them due to the amazing effect it does have on my dark circles especially considering the price point of chinese rmb  aud which isnt too bad in comparison to some other eye cream out there it find that it really does make me look less like a panda from the chengdu region of china this province is renowned for their pandas and just a bit more human how do i get thisthis brand is relatively quite new so i do think it is harder to obtain than most of the other brands i usehave spoken about this is only available in china as far as i am concerned via the lu ming tang website but i do think if you email the ladies directly at welovelumingtangcomcn they may be able to help you ship overseas let me know how you go related posts jul   skincare tips online shopping green beauty skincare skincare tips asian skincare orchidspeonies comment jul   skincare tips online shopping green beauty skincare

military history naval history this box view talk edit the ming dynasty was the ruling dynasty of china – then known as the empire of the great ming – for  years – following the collapse of the mongolled yuan dynasty the ming described by edwin o reischauer john k fairbank and albert m craig as one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history was the last imperial dynasty in china ruled by ethnic han chinese although the primary capital of beijing fell in  to a rebellion led by li zicheng who established the shun dynasty soon replaced by the manchuled qing dynasty regimes loyal to the ming throne – collectively called the southern ming – survived until  the hongwu emperor ruled – attempted to create a society of selfsufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty the empires standing army exceeded one million troops and the navys dockyards in nanjing were the largest in the world he also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates enfeoffing his many sons throughout china and attempting to guide these princes through the huang ming zu xun a set of published dynastic instructions this failed spectacularly when his teenage successor the jianwen emperor attempted to curtail his uncles power prompting the jingnan campaign an uprising that placed the prince of yan upon the throne as the yongle emperor in  the yongle emperor established yan as a secondary capital and renamed it beijing constructed the forbidden city and restored the grand canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments he rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the confucian scholarbureaucrats one zheng he led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the indian ocean as far as arabia and the eastern coasts of africa the rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances the capture of the zhengtong emperor during the  tumu crisis ended them completely the imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the great wall of china into its modern form wideranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at nanjing hampered accurate figures estimates for the lateming population vary from  to  million but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or donated their lands to taxexempt eunuchs or temples haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from japanese pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves by the th century however the expansion of european trade – albeit restricted to islands near guangzhou like macau – spread the columbian exchange of crops plants and animals into china introducing chili peppers to sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes which diminished famines and spurred population growth the growth of portuguese spanish and dutch trade created new demand for chinese products and produced a massive influx of japanese and american silver this abundance of specie remonetized the ming economy whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted while traditional confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created the heterodoxy introduced by wang yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude zhang juzhengs initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the little ice age joined changes in japanese and spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers to be able to pay their taxes combined with crop failure floods and epidemic the

establish a new dynasty in  zhu yuanzhang eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel han faction chen youliang in the battle of lake poyang arguably the largest naval battle in history known for its ambitious use of fire ships zhus force of  ming sailors were able to defeat a han rebel force over triple their size claimed to be strong the victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction leaving zhu yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful yangtze river valley and cementing his power in the south after the dynastic head of the red turbans suspiciously died in  while a guest of zhu there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the yuan capital dadu presentday beijing

the same year zhu yuanzhang took hongwu or vastly martial as his era name reign of the hongwu emperor portrait of the hongwu emperor ruled in – hongwu made an immediate effort to rebuild state infrastructure he built a  km  mi long wall around nanjing as well as new palaces and government halls the history of ming states that as early as  zhu yuanzhang had begun drafting a new confucian law code the da ming lü which was completed by  and repeated certain clauses found in the old tang code of  hongwu organized a military system known as the weisuo which was similar to the fubing system of the tang dynasty – in  hongwu had the chancellor hu weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him after that hongwu abolished the chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor a precedent mostly followed throughout the ming period with a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects hongwu established the jinyiwei a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard some  people were executed in a series of purges during his rule the hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify china of barbarian influence however he also sought to use the yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in china and other areas ruled by the yuan he adopted many yuan military practices recruited

conquest of manchuria the early ming court could not and did not aspire to the control imposed upon the jurchens in manchuria by the mongols yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers by the end of the hongwu reign the essentials of a policy toward the jurchens had taken shape most of the

commanderies overseeing tibetan administration while also renewing titles of exyuan dynasty officials from tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of tibetan buddhist sects however turrell v wylie states that censorship in the mingshi in favor of bolstering the ming emperors prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of sinotibetan relations during the ming era modern scholars debate whether the ming dynasty had sovereignty over tibet some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the jiajing emperor r – persecuted buddhism in favor of daoism at court others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship others note the ming need for central asian horses and the need to maintain the teahorse trade the ming sporadically sent armed forays into tibet during the th century which the tibetans successfully resisted several scholars point out that unlike the preceding mongols the ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in tibet the wanli emperor r – attempted to reestablish sinotibetan relations in the wake of a

the ming and qing dynasties from  until  when the republic of china evicted puyi from the inner court departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the three departments and six ministries system which was instituted by various dynasties since late han  bce –  ce the ming administration had only one department the secretariat that controlled the six ministries following the execution of the chancellor hu weiyong in  the hongwu emperor abolished the secretariat the censorate and the chief military commission and personally took charge of the six ministries and the regional five military commissions thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers the grand secretariat at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork was instituted but without employing grand counselors or chancellors the hongwu emperor sent his heir apparent to shaanxi in  to tour and soothe xunfu the region in  the yongle emperor commissioned  officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties by  these xunfu assignments became institutionalized as grand coordinators hence the censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors later with censorsinchief by  the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censorinchief or assistant censorinchief and were allowed direct access to the emperor as in prior dynasties the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the censorate censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early ming the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the s by the late ming dynasty there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment grand secretariat and six ministries a portrait of jiang shunfu an official under the hongzhi emperor now in the nanjing museum the decoration of two cranes on his chest is a rank badge that indicates he was a civil official of the first rank governmental institutions in china conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus reflecting its own particular interests the ming administration utilized grand secretaries to assist the emperor handling paperwork under the reign of the yongle emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and grand preceptor a topranking nonfunctional civil service post under the hongxi emperor ruled – the grand secretariat drew its members from the hanlin academy and were considered part of the imperial authority not the ministerial one hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times the secretariat operated as a coordinating agency whereas the six ministries—personnel revenue rites war justice and public works—were direct administrative organs of the state the ministry of personnel was in charge of appointments merit ratings promotions and demotions of officials as well as granting of honorific titles the ministry of revenue was in charge of gathering census data collecting taxes and handling state revenues while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it the ministry of rites was in charge of state ceremonies rituals and sacrifices it also oversaw registers for buddhist and daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states the ministry of war was in charge of the appointments promotions and demotions of military officers the maintenance of military installations equipment and weapons as well as the courier system the ministry of justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes but had no supervisory role over the censorate or the grand court of revision the ministry of public works had charge of government construction projects hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service manufacturing government equipment the maintenance of roads and canals standardization of weights and measures and the gathering of resources from the countryside bureaus and offices for the imperial household ming coinage –th century the imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus female servants were organized into the bureau of palace attendance bureau of ceremonies bureau of apparel bureau of foodstuffs bureau of the bedchamber bureau of handicrafts and office of staff surveillance starting in the s eunuchs began taking over these ladies positions until only the bureau of apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the directorate of palace attendants but as eunuch power at court increased so did their administrative offices with eventual twelve directorates four offices and eight bureaus the dynasty had a vast imperial household staffed with thousands of eunuchs who were headed by the directorate of palace attendants the eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance ceremonial rites food utensils documents stables seals apparel and so on the offices were in charge of providing fuel music paper and baths the bureaus were in charge of weapons silverwork laundering headgear bronzework textile manufacture wineries and gardens at times the most influential eunuch in the directorate of ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies there was a civil service office called the seal office which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals tallies and stamps there were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes personnel scholarofficials candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk by qiu ying – the hongwu emperor from  to  staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only after that the scholarofficials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the sui dynasty – theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials although it was frowned upon for merchants to join in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class however the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials this was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions where education was the most advanced the expansion of the printing industry since song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces for young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary for adult examination candidates there were massproduced inexpensive volumes of confucian classics and successful examination answers as in earlier periods the focus of the examination was classical confucian texts while the bulk of test material centered on the four books outlined by zhu xi in the th century ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the  requirement of completing the eightlegged essay a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends the exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades each grade divided into two degrees with ranging salaries nominally paid in piculs of rice according to their rank while provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to lowranking posts like the county graduates those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi presented scholar degree and assured a highlevel position in  years of ming rule and ninety palace examinations the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was  ebrey states that there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time on the order of one out of  adult males this was in comparison to the  shengyuan government students the lowest tier of graduates by the th century the maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade  and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over  school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years the chief instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a secondgrade county graduate the supervisorate of imperial instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne this office was headed by a grand supervisor of instruction who was ranked as first class of grade three lesser functionaries the xuande emperor playing chuiwan with his eunuchs a game similar to golf by an anonymous court painter of the xuande period – scholarofficials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of nonranked personnel called lesser functionaries they outnumbered officials by four to one charles hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as  throughout the empire these lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank the one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries eunuchs princes and generals detail of the emperors approach showing the wanli emperors royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry full panoramic painting here eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the ming dynasty one of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the eastern depot at the beginning of the dynasty later the western depot this secret service was overseen by the directorate of ceremonial hence this state organs often totalitarian affiliation eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks only theirs had four grades instead of nine descendants of the first ming emperor were made princes and given typically nominal military commands annual stipends and large estates the title used was king  wáng but – unlike the princes in the han and jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories the princes did not serve any administrative function and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors the rebellion of the prince of yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes but once the yongle emperor was enthroned he continued his nephews policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border although princes served no organ of state administration the princes consorts of the imperial princesses and ennobled relatives did staff the imperial clan court which supervised the imperial genealogy like scholarofficials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely meritbased and confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence wu over the cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after  the military even held their own examinations to test military skills in addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the yuan period the ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector in the early half of the dynasty men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them society and culture literature and arts further information ming dynasty painting and ming poetry lofty mount lu by shen zhou  literature painting poetry music and chinese opera of various types flourished during the ming dynasty especially in the economically prosperous lower yangzi valley although short fiction had been popular as far back as the tang dynasty – and the works of contemporaneous authors such as xu guangqi xu xiake and song yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel while the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of classical chinese those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families merchants and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed vernacular chinese literati scholars edited or developed major chinese novels into mature form in this period such as water margin and journey to the west jin ping mei published in  although incorporating earlier material marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology in the later years of the dynasty feng menglong and ling mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction theater scripts were equally imaginative the most famous the peony pavilion was written by tang xianzu – with its first performance at the pavilion of prince teng in  informal essay and travel writing was another highlight xu xiake – a travel literature author published his travel diaries in  written characters with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy the first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in beijing was in  by  the beijing gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing the new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late ming period for the readership of the merchant class poetry of min ding th century in contrast to xu xiake who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature the chinese poet and official yuan hongdao – used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with confucian court politics yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholarofficial this antiofficial sentiment in yuans travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the song dynasty poet and official su shi – yuan hongdao and his two brothers yuan zongdao – and yuan zhongdao – were the founders of the gongan school of letters this highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism which was also apparent in ming vernacular novels such as the jin ping mei yet even gentry and scholarofficials were affected by the new popular romantic literature seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate painting of flowers a butterfly and rock sculpture by chen hongshou – small leaf album paintings like this one first became popular in the song dynasty famous painters included ni zan and dong qichang as well as the four masters of the ming dynasty shen zhou tang yin wen zhengming and qiu ying they drew upon the techniques styles and complexity in painting achieved by their song and yuan predecessors but added techniques and styles wellknown ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art the artist qiu ying was once paid  kg  oz of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the

various forms of chinese folk religion and the three teachings – confucianism taoism and buddhism the yuansupported tibetan lamas fell from favor and the early ming emperors particularly favored taoism granting its practitioners many positions in the states ritual offices the hongwu emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the mongol yuan dynasty and the prolific prince of ning zhu quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking buddhism as a foreign mourning cult deleterious to the state and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the taoist canon islam was also wellestablished throughout china with a history said to have begun with sad ibn abi waqqas during the tang dynasty and strong official support during the yuan although the ming sharply curtailed this support there were still several prominent muslim figures early on including the hongwu emperors generals chang yuqun lan yu ding dexing and mu ying as well as the yongle emperors powerful eunuch zheng he bodhisattva manjusri in blancdechine by he chaozong th century song yingxing devoted an entire section of his book to the ceramics industry in the making of porcelain items like this the advent of the ming was initially devastating to christianity in his first year the hongwu emperor declared the eightyyearold franciscan missions among the yuan heterodox and illegal the centuriesold nestorian church also disappeared during the later ming a new wave of christian missionaries arrived – particularly jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st pauls college on macau after its founding in  the most influential was matteo ricci whose map of the myriad countries of the world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with the convert xu guangqi led to the first chinese translation of euclids elements in  the discovery of a nestorian stele at xian in  also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the nanjing incident of  which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced the others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by the chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de ursis – and a return by the jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the confucian mold restored their fortunes however by the end of the ming the dominicans had begun the chinese rites controversy in rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of christianity under the qing dynasty during his mission ricci was also contacted in beijing by one of the approximately  kaifeng jews and introduced them and their long history in china to europe however the  flood caused by kaifengs ming governor devastated the community which lost five of its twelve families its synagogue and most of its torah philosophy wang yangmings confucianism wang yangming – considered the most influential confucian thinker since zhu xi during the ming dynasty the neoconfucian doctrines of the song scholar zhu xi were embraced by the court and the chinese literati at large although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the yongle emperors extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of fang xiaoru in  the ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming – whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xis concept of the extension of knowledge  or  gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as confucius and mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the classics but not experienced the real world conservative reaction a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to the zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholarbureaucrats were wary of wangs heterodoxy the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer wang yangmings disciple and saltmine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he xinyin  challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests the liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by the censorate and by the donglin academy reestablished in  these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu xiancheng – argued against wangs idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court urban and rural life a ming dynasty red lacquer box with intricate carving of people in the countryside surrounded by a floral border design wang gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the song dynasty – communities in ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city not only was the blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations chinese  since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth emperor minghuangs journey to sichuan a ming dynasty painting after qiu ying – a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a fathers line of work this would include – but was not limited to – coffinmakers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodlemakers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a protobanking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of the huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised the cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in the south the myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more ownercultivators north of the huai river due to harsher climate living not far above

the song dynasty the ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the western world in fact key advances in chinese science in the late ming were spurred by contact with europe in  johann adam schall von bell wrote the first chinese treatise on the telescope the yuanjingshuo far seeing optic glass in  the chongzhen emperor acquired the telescope of the late johann schreck – the heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the catholic missionaries in china but johannes kepler and galileo galileis ideas slowly trickled into china starting with the polish jesuit michael boym – in  adam schall von bells treatise in  and finally joseph edkins alex wylie and john fryer in the th century catholic jesuits in china would promote copernican theory at court yet at the same time embrace the ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until  that catholic missionaries in china sponsored the heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo – and guo shoujing – had laid the basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until  with the efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during the late ming for example the field mill the chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at  ¼ days giving an error of  min and  sec a year or roughly a full day every  years although the ming had adopted guo shoujings shoushi calendar of  which was just as accurate as the gregorian calendar the ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the ming and the statutes of the ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixthgeneration descendant of the hongxi emperor the prince zhu zaiyu – submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in  but the ultraconservative astronomical commission rejected it this was the same zhu zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin – in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in  a year earlier the memorial of xing yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the supervisor of the astronomical bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy xing would later serve with xu guangqi in reforming the calendar chinese  in  according to western standards a point compass chart employed by zheng he during his explorations when the ming founder hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the yuan dynastys palace at khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets selfoperating tiger automata dragonheaded devices that spouted mists of perfume and mechanical clocks in the tradition of yi xing – and su song – – he associated all of them with the decadence of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by the divisional director of the ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that thcentury european clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments  with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese  chinese records – namely the yuan shi chinese  – describe the fivewheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl – which featured the scoop wheel of su songs earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of the time this sanddriven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou shuxue fl – who added a fourth large gear wheel changed gear ratios and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often portrait of matteo ricci by yu wenhui latinized as emmanuel pereira dated the year of riccis death  the chinese were intrigued with european technology but so were visiting europeans of chinese technology in  abraham ortelius – featured in his atlas theatrum orbis terrarum the peculiar chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages just like chinese ships gonzales de mendoza also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on chinese silken robes – while gerardus mercator – featured them in his atlas john milton – in one of his famous poems and andreas everardus van braam houckgeest – in the writings of his travel diary in china the encyclopedist song yingxing – documented a wide array of technologies metallurgic and industrial processes in his tiangong kaiwu chinese  encyclopedia of  this includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a stillhead that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a ripcord and steel flint wheel a cannon from the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen before the latters death in  focusing on agriculture in his nongzheng quanshu the agronomist xu guangqi – took an interest in irrigation fertilizers famine relief economic and textile crops and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry there were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty but by the mid to late ming the chinese began to frequently employ europeanstyle artillery and firearms the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen sometime before the latters death on  may  with a preface added by jiao in  featured many types of cuttingedge gunpowder weaponry for the time this includes hollow gunpowderfilled exploding cannonballs land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights pins and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses naval mines finmounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile shaped like a dragons head and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels li shizhen – – one of the most renowned pharmacologists and physicians in chinese history – belonged to the late ming period his bencao gangmu is a medical text with  entries each entry with its own name called a gang the mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name inoculation although it can be traced to earlier chinese folk medicine was detailed in chinese texts by the sixteenth century throughout the ming dynasty around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox in regards to oral hygiene the ancient egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end but the chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in  although it used stiff pig hair population appreciating plums by chen hongshou – showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the ming dynasty the historian timothy brook notes that the ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the ming even adult women were underreported for example the daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of  males and  females in  the government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide the practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however the dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding  by  cant likely be explained by infanticide alone the xuande emperor r – he stated in  that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but the population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen – governor of south zhili – in his  report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce the number of people counted in the census of  was  however this number dropped significantly when the government found that some  million people were missing from the tax census of  even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in  the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace the government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of  people in  in his studies on the population of china ho pingti suggests revising the  census to  million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after  ranged between  and  million while the population was in fact increasing even the hongzhi emperor r – remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around  the population of china was perhaps  million people citing heijdra and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using the gazetteers brook estimates that the overall population under the chenghua emperor r – was roughly  million despite midming census figures hovering around  million while prefectures across the empire in the midming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or woodcutters that contributed to deforestation the hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region while the jiajing emperor r – finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with the jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by the late ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since  fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps  million in the late ming dynasty while brook estimates  million and ebrey states perhaps as large as  million however a great epidemic that entered china through the northwest in  ravaged the densely populated areas along the grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that  of the local populace in one

mongolled yuan dynasty the ming described by edwin o reischauer john k fairbank and albert m craig as one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history was the last imperial dynasty in china ruled by ethnic han chinese although the primary capital of beijing fell in  to a rebellion led by li zicheng who established the shun dynasty soon replaced by the manchuled qing dynasty regimes loyal to the ming throne – collectively called the southern ming – survived until  the hongwu emperor ruled – attempted to create a society of selfsufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty the empires standing army exceeded one million troops and the navys dockyards in nanjing were the largest in the world he also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates enfeoffing his many sons throughout china and attempting to guide these princes through the huang ming zu xun a set of published dynastic instructions this failed spectacularly when his teenage successor the jianwen emperor attempted to curtail his uncles power prompting the jingnan campaign an uprising that placed the prince of yan upon the throne as the yongle emperor in  the yongle emperor established yan as a secondary capital and renamed it beijing constructed the forbidden city and restored the grand canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments he rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the confucian scholarbureaucrats one zheng he led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the indian ocean as far as arabia and the eastern coasts of africa the rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances the capture of the zhengtong emperor during the  tumu crisis ended them completely the imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the great wall of china into its modern form wideranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at nanjing hampered accurate figures estimates for the lateming population vary from  to  million but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or donated their lands to taxexempt eunuchs or temples haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from japanese pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves by the th century however the expansion of european trade – albeit restricted to islands near guangzhou like macau – spread the columbian exchange of crops plants and animals into china introducing chili peppers to sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes which diminished famines and spurred population growth the growth of portuguese spanish and dutch trade created new demand for chinese products and produced a massive influx of japanese and american silver this abundance of specie remonetized the ming economy whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted while traditional confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created the heterodoxy introduced by wang yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude zhang juzhengs initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the little ice age joined changes in japanese and spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers to be able to pay their taxes combined with crop failure floods and epidemic the

of the yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against han chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion overtaxation of areas hardhit by inflation and massive flooding of the yellow river as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects consequently agriculture and the economy were in shambles and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the yellow river a number of han chinese groups revolted including the red turbans in  the red turbans were affiliated with the white lotus a buddhist secret society zhu yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and buddhist monk who joined the red turbans in  he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander in  zhus rebel force captured the city of nanjing which he would later establish as the capital of the ming dynasty with the yuan dynasty crumbling competing rebel groups began fighting for control of the country and thus the right to establish a new dynasty in  zhu yuanzhang eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel han faction chen youliang in the battle of lake poyang arguably the largest naval battle in history known for its ambitious use of fire ships zhus force of  ming sailors were able to defeat a han rebel force over triple their size claimed to be strong the victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction leaving zhu yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful yangtze river valley and cementing his power in the south after the dynastic head of the red turbans suspiciously died in  while a guest of zhu there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the yuan capital dadu presentday beijing in  the last yuan emperor fled north to the upper capital shangdu and zhu declared the founding of the ming dynasty after razing the yuan palaces in dadu to the ground the city was renamed beiping in the same year zhu yuanzhang took hongwu or vastly martial as his era name reign of the hongwu emperor portrait of the hongwu emperor ruled in – hongwu made an immediate effort to rebuild state infrastructure he built a  km  mi long wall around nanjing as well as new palaces and government halls the history of ming states that as early as  zhu yuanzhang had begun drafting a new confucian law code the da ming lü which was completed by  and repeated certain clauses found in the old tang code of  hongwu organized a military system known as the weisuo which was similar to the fubing system of the tang dynasty – in  hongwu had the chancellor hu weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him after that hongwu abolished the chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor a precedent mostly followed throughout the ming period with a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects hongwu established the jinyiwei a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard some  people were executed in a series of purges during his rule the hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify china of barbarian influence however he also sought to use the yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in china and other areas ruled by the yuan he adopted many yuan military practices recruited mongol soldiers and continued to request korean concubines and eunuchs southwestern frontier main article ming conquest of yunnan the old south gate of the ancient city of dali yunnan in qinghai the salar muslims voluntarily came under ming rule their clan leaders capitulating around  uyghur troops under uyghur general hala bashi suppressed the miao rebellions of the s and settled in changde hunan hui muslim troops also settled in changde hunan after serving the ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes in  the ming dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the kingdom of dali following the successful effort by hui muslim ming armies to defeat yuanloyalist mongol and hui muslim troops holding out in yunnan province the hui troops under general mu ying who was appointed governor of yunnan were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort by the end of the th century some  military colonists settled some  mu  acres of land in what is now yunnan and guizhou roughly half a million more chinese settlers came in later periods these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic makeup of the region since formerly more than half of the population were nonhan peoples resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more miao and yao revolts in  to  which were crushed by an army of  ming troops including  mongols joining the  local guangxi see miao rebellions ming dynasty after the scholar and philosopher wang yangming – suppressed another rebellion in the region he advocated single unitary administration of chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification of the local peoples campaign in the northeast main article manchuria under ming rule the great wall of china although the rammed earth walls of the ancient warring states were combined into a unified wall under the qin and han dynasties the vast majority of the brick and stone great wall seen today is a product of the ming dynasty after the overthrow of the mongol yuan dynasty by the ming dynasty in  manchuria remained under control of the mongols of the northern yuan dynasty based in mongolia naghachu a former yuan official and a uriankhai general of the northern yuan dynasty won hegemony over the mongol tribes in manchuria liaoyang province of the former yuan dynasty he grew strong in the northeast with forces large enough numbering hundreds of thousands to threaten invasion of the newly founded ming dynasty in order to restore the mongols to power in china the ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the mongols to attack in  the ming sent a military campaign to attack naghachu which concluded with the surrender of naghachu and ming conquest of manchuria the early ming court could not and did not aspire to the control imposed upon the jurchens in manchuria by the mongols yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers by the end of the hongwu reign the essentials of a policy toward the jurchens had taken shape most of the inhabitants of manchuria except for the wild jurchens were at peace with china the ming had created many guards  wei in manchuria but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control in  the ming dynasty under yongle emperor established the nurgan regional military commission on the banks of the amur river and yishiha a eunuch of haixi jurchen derivation was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the amur to pacify the wild jurchens after the death of yongle emperor the nurgan regional military commission was abolished in  and the ming court ceased to have substantial activities there although the guards continued to exist in manchuria by the late ming period ming political presence in manchuria had waned considerably relations with tibet main article sinotibetan relations during the ming dynasty a thcentury tibetan thangka of guhyasamaja akshobhyavajra the ming dynasty court gathered various tribute items that were native products of tibet such as thangkas and in return granted gifts to tibetan tributebearers the mingshi – the official history of the ming dynasty compiled by the qing dynasty in  – states that the ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing tibetan administration while also renewing titles of exyuan dynasty officials from tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of tibetan buddhist sects however turrell v wylie states that censorship in the mingshi in favor of bolstering the ming emperors prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of sinotibetan relations during the ming era modern scholars debate whether the ming dynasty had sovereignty over tibet some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the jiajing emperor r – persecuted buddhism in favor of daoism at court others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship others note the ming need for central asian horses and the need to maintain the teahorse trade the ming sporadically sent armed forays into tibet during the th century which the tibetans successfully resisted several scholars point out that unlike the preceding mongols the ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in tibet the wanli emperor r – attempted to reestablish sinotibetan relations in the wake of a mongoltibetan alliance initiated in  an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent manchu qing dynasty – in their support for the dalai lama of the yellow hat sect by the late th century the mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the yellow hat dalai lama after their increasing presence in the amdo region culminating in the conquest of tibet by güshi khan – in  establishing the khoshut khanate reign of the yongle emperor main article yongle emperor rise to power portrait of the yongle emperor ruled in – the hongwu emperor specified his grandson zhu yunwen as his successor and he assumed the throne as the jianwen emperor – after hongwus death in  the most powerful of hongwus sons zhu di then the militarily mighty disagreed with this and soon a political showdown erupted between him and his nephew jianwen after jianwen arrested many of zhu dis associates zhu di plotted a rebellion that sparked a threeyear civil war under the pretext of rescuing the young jianwen from corrupting officials zhu di personally led forces in the revolt the palace in nanjing was burned to the ground along with jianwen himself his wife mother and courtiers zhu di assumed the throne as the yongle emperor – his reign is universally viewed by scholars as a second founding of the ming dynasty since he reversed many of his fathers policies new capital and foreign engagement yongle demoted nanjing to a secondary capital and in  announced the new capital of china was to be at his power base in beijing construction of a new city there lasted from  to  employing hundreds of thousands of workers daily at the center was the political node of the imperial city and at the center of this was the forbidden city the palatial residence of the emperor and his family by  the outer city was added to the south which brought the overall size of beijing to  by ½ miles the ming tombs located  km  mi north of beijing the site was chosen by yongle beginning in  the yongle emperor entrusted his favored eunuch commander zheng he – as the admiral for a gigantic new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions the chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land since the han dynasty  bce –  ce and engaged in private overseas trade but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and scale to service seven different tributary voyages the nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from  to  including treasure ships measuring  m  ft to  m  ft in length and  m  ft to  m  ft in width yongle also used woodblock printing to spread chinese culture and used the military especially cavalry to expand chinas borders this included the brief occupation of vietnam from the initial invasion in  until the ming withdrawal in  as a result of protracted guerrilla warfare led by the subsequent founder of the vietnamese lê dynasty tumu crisis and the ming mongols main articles tumu crisis and rebellion of cao qin a bengali envoys presented a tribute giraffe in the name of king saif aldin hamzah shah of bengal r – to the yongle emperor of ming china r – the oirat leader esen tayisi launched an invasion into ming china in july  the chief eunuch wang zhen encouraged the zhengtong emperor r – to lead a force personally to face the oirats after a recent ming defeat the emperor left the capital and put his halfbrother zhu qiyu in charge of affairs as temporary regent on  september esen routed zhengtongs army and zhengtong was captured – an event known as the tumu crisis the oirats held the zhengtong emperor for ransom however this scheme was foiled once the emperors younger brother assumed the throne under the era name jingtai r – the oirats were also repelled once the jingtai emperors confidant and defense minister yu qian – gained control of the ming armed forces holding the zhengtong emperor in captivity was a useless bargaining chip for the oirats as long as another sat on his throne so they released him back into ming china the former emperor was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against the jingtai emperor in  known as the wresting the gate incident the former emperor retook the throne under the new era name tianshun r – tianshun proved to be a troubled time and mongol forces within the ming military structure continued to be problematic on  august  the chinese general cao qin and his ming troops of mongol descent staged a coup against the tianshun emperor out of fear of being next on his purgelist of those who aided him in the wresting the gate incident caos rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the imperial city doused by rain during the battle and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide while the yongle emperor had staged five major offensives north of the great wall against the mongols and the oirats the constant threat of oirat incursions prompted the ming authorities to fortify the great wall from the late th century to the th century nevertheless john fairbank notes that it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed chinas siege mentality yet the great wall was not meant to be a purely defensive fortification its towers functioned rather as a series of lit beacons and signalling stations to allow rapid warning to friendly units of advancing enemy troops decline and fall of the ming dynasty main article fall of the ming dynasty reign of the wanli emperor the wanli emperor ruled in – in state ceremonial court dress the financial drain of the imjin war in korea against the japanese was one of the many problems – fiscal or other – facing ming china during the reign of the wanli emperor – in the beginning of his reign wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs his grand secretary zhang juzheng – built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials however there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances officials soon banded together in opposing political factions over time wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers preferring to stay behind the walls of the forbidden city and out of his officials sight scholarofficials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his demands or message relayed to the emperor role of eunuchs tianqiera teacups from the nantoyōsō collection in japan the tianqi emperor was heavily influenced and largely controlled by the eunuch wei zhongxian – the hongwu emperor forbade eunuchs to learn how to read or engage in politics whether or not these restrictions were carried out with absolute success in his reign eunuchs during the yongle emperors reign and afterwards managed huge imperial workshops commanded armies and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials the eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the ming such as wang zhen wang zhi and liu jin excessive tyrannical eunuch power did not become evident until the s when the wanli emperor increased their rights over the civil bureaucracy and granted them power to collect provincial taxes the eunuch wei zhongxian – dominated the court of the tianqi emperor r – and had his political rivals tortured to death mostly the vocal critics from the faction of the donglin society he ordered temples built in his honor throughout the ming empire and built personal palaces created with funds allocated for building the previous emperors tombs his friends and family gained important positions without qualifications wei also published a historical work lambasting and belittling his political opponents the instability at court came right as natural calamity pestilence rebellion and foreign invasion came to a peak the chongzhen emperor r – had wei dismissed from court which led to weis suicide shortly after economic breakdown and natural disasters further information europeans in medieval china spring morning in a han palace by qiu ying – excessive luxury and decadence marked the late ming period spurred by the enormous state bullion of incoming silver and by private transactions involving silver during the last years of the wanli era and those of his two successors an economic crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empires chief medium of exchange silver the portuguese first established trade with china in  trading japanese silver for chinese silk and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the ming court in  to settle macau as their permanent trade base in china their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the spanish while even the dutch challenged them for control of this trade philip iv of spain reigned – began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from new spain and peru across the pacific through the philippines towards china in favor of shipping americanmined silver through spanish ports in  the new tokugawa regime of japan shut down most of its foreign trade with european powers cutting off another source of silver coming into china these events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces people began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline in the s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver by  that sum could fetch half an ounce and by  only onethird of an ounce for peasants this meant economic disaster since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper famines became common in northern china in the early th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the little ice age famine alongside tax increases widespread military desertions a declining relief system and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and floodcontrol projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility the central government starved of resources could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities making matters worse a widespread epidemic spread across china from zhejiang to henan killing an unknown but large number of people the deadliest earthquake of all time the shaanxi earthquake of  occurred during the jiajing emperors reign killing approximately  people rise of the manchu shanhaiguan along the great wall the gate where the manchus were repeatedly repelled before being finally let through by wu sangui in  a jurchen tribal leader named nurhaci r – starting with just a small tribe rapidly gained control over all the manchurian tribes during the japanese invasions of joseon korea in the s he offered to lead his tribes in support of the ming and joseon army this offer was declined but he was granted honorific ming titles for his gesture recognizing the weakness of ming authority north of their border he united all of the adjacent northern tribes and consolidated power in the region surrounding his homeland as the jurchen jin dynasty had done previously in  he broke relations with the ming court and in  demanded a tribute from them to redress

were all strongholds of ming resistance however there were several pretenders for the ming throne and their forces were divided these scattered ming remnants in southern china after  were collectively designated by thcentury historians as the southern ming each bastion of resistance was individually defeated by the qing until  when the last southern ming emperor died the yongli emperor zhu youlang the last ming princes to hold out were the prince of ningjing zhu shugui and the son of zhu yihai the prince of lu zhu honghuan  who stayed with koxingas ming loyalists in the kingdom of tungning

dynasty official who lived during the th century provinces of ming dynasty in  the ming emperors took over the provincial administration system of the yuan dynasty and the thirteen ming provinces are the precursors of the modern provinces throughout the song dynasty the largest political division was the circuit lu  however after the jurchen invasion in  the song court established four semiautonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the yuan ming and qing dynasties copied on the yuan model the ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions one civil one military and one for surveillance below the level of the province sheng  were prefectures fu  operating under a prefect zhifu 知 followed by subprefectures zhou  under a subprefect the lowest unit was the county xian  overseen by a magistrate besides the provinces there were also two large areas that belonged to no province but were metropolitan areas jing  attached to nanjing and beijing institutions and bureaus institutional trends the forbidden city the official imperial household of the ming and qing dynasties from  until  when the republic of china evicted puyi from the inner court departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the three departments and six ministries system which was instituted by various dynasties since late han  bce –  ce the ming administration had only one department the secretariat that controlled the six ministries following the execution of the chancellor hu weiyong in  the hongwu emperor abolished the secretariat the censorate and the chief military commission and personally took charge of the six ministries and the regional five military commissions thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers the grand secretariat at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork was instituted but without employing grand counselors or chancellors the hongwu emperor sent his heir apparent to shaanxi in  to tour and soothe xunfu the region in  the yongle emperor commissioned  officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties by  these xunfu assignments became institutionalized as grand coordinators hence the censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors later with censorsinchief by  the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censorinchief or assistant censorinchief and were allowed direct access to the emperor as in prior dynasties the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the censorate censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early ming the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the s by the late ming dynasty there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment grand secretariat and six ministries a portrait of jiang shunfu an official under the hongzhi emperor now in the nanjing museum the decoration of two cranes on his chest is a rank badge that indicates he was a civil official of the first rank governmental institutions in china conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus reflecting its own particular interests the ming administration utilized grand secretaries to assist the emperor handling paperwork under the reign of the yongle emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and grand preceptor a topranking nonfunctional civil service post under the hongxi emperor ruled – the grand secretariat drew its members from the hanlin academy and were considered part of the imperial authority not the ministerial one hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times the secretariat operated as a coordinating agency whereas the six ministries—personnel revenue rites war justice and public works—were direct administrative organs of the state the ministry of personnel was in charge of appointments merit ratings promotions and demotions of officials as well as granting of honorific titles the ministry of revenue was in charge of gathering census data collecting taxes and handling state revenues while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it the ministry of rites was in charge of state ceremonies rituals and sacrifices it also oversaw registers for buddhist and daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states the ministry of war was in charge of the appointments promotions and demotions of military officers the maintenance of military installations equipment and weapons as well as the courier system the ministry of justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes but had no supervisory role over the censorate or the grand court of revision the ministry of public works had charge of government construction projects hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service manufacturing government equipment the maintenance of roads and canals standardization of weights and measures and the gathering of resources from the countryside bureaus and offices for the imperial household ming coinage –th century the imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus female servants were organized into the bureau of palace attendance bureau of ceremonies bureau of apparel bureau of foodstuffs bureau of the bedchamber bureau of handicrafts and office of staff surveillance starting in the s eunuchs began taking over these ladies positions until only the bureau of apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the directorate of palace attendants but as eunuch power at court increased so did their administrative offices with eventual twelve directorates four offices and eight bureaus the dynasty had a vast imperial household staffed with thousands of eunuchs who were headed by the directorate of palace attendants the eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance ceremonial rites food utensils documents stables seals apparel and so on the offices were in charge of providing fuel music paper and baths the bureaus were in charge of weapons silverwork laundering headgear bronzework textile manufacture wineries and gardens at times the most influential eunuch in the directorate of ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies there was a civil service office called the seal office which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals tallies and stamps there were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes personnel scholarofficials candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk by qiu ying – the hongwu emperor from  to  staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only after that the scholarofficials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the sui dynasty – theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials although it was frowned upon for merchants to join in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class however the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials this was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions where education was the most advanced the expansion of the printing industry since song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces for young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary for adult examination candidates there were massproduced inexpensive volumes of confucian classics and successful examination answers as in earlier periods the focus of the examination was classical confucian texts while the bulk of test material centered on the four books outlined by zhu xi in the th century ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the  requirement of completing the eightlegged essay a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends the exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades each grade divided into two degrees with ranging salaries nominally paid in piculs of rice according to their rank while provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to lowranking posts like the county graduates those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi presented scholar degree and assured a highlevel position in  years of ming rule and ninety palace examinations the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was  ebrey states that there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time on the order of one out of  adult males this was in comparison to the  shengyuan government students the lowest tier of graduates by the th century the maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade  and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over  school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years the chief instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a secondgrade county graduate the supervisorate of imperial instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne this office was headed by a grand supervisor of instruction who was ranked as first class of grade three lesser functionaries the xuande emperor playing chuiwan with his eunuchs a game similar to golf by an anonymous court painter of the xuande period – scholarofficials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of nonranked personnel called lesser functionaries they outnumbered officials by four to one charles hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as  throughout the empire these lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank the one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries eunuchs princes and generals detail of the emperors approach showing the wanli emperors royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry full panoramic painting here eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the ming dynasty one of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the eastern depot at the beginning of the dynasty later the western depot this secret service was overseen by the directorate of ceremonial hence this state organs often totalitarian affiliation eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks only theirs had four grades instead of nine descendants of the first ming emperor were made princes and given typically nominal military commands annual stipends and large estates the title used was king  wáng but – unlike the princes in the han and jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories the princes did not serve any administrative function and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors the rebellion of the prince of yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes but once the yongle emperor was enthroned he continued his nephews policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border although princes served no organ of state administration the princes consorts of the imperial princesses and ennobled relatives did staff the imperial clan court which supervised the imperial genealogy like scholarofficials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely meritbased and confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence wu over the cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after  the military even held their own examinations to test military skills in addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the yuan period the ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector in the early half of the dynasty men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them society and culture literature and arts further information ming dynasty painting and ming poetry lofty mount lu by shen zhou  literature painting poetry music and chinese opera of various types flourished during the ming dynasty especially in the economically prosperous lower yangzi valley although short fiction had been popular as far back as the tang dynasty – and the works of contemporaneous authors such as xu guangqi xu xiake and song yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel while the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of classical chinese those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families merchants and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed vernacular chinese literati scholars edited or developed major chinese novels into mature form in this period such as water margin and journey to the west jin ping mei published in  although incorporating earlier material marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology in the later years of the dynasty feng menglong and ling mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction theater scripts were equally imaginative the most famous the peony pavilion was written by tang xianzu – with its first performance at the pavilion of prince teng in  informal essay and travel writing was another highlight xu xiake – a travel literature author published his travel diaries in  written characters with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy the first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in beijing was in  by  the beijing gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing the new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late ming period for the readership of the merchant class poetry of min ding th century in contrast to xu xiake who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature the chinese poet and official yuan hongdao – used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with confucian court politics yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholarofficial this antiofficial sentiment in yuans travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the song dynasty poet and official su shi – yuan hongdao and his two brothers yuan zongdao – and yuan zhongdao – were the founders of the gongan school of letters this highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism which was also apparent in ming vernacular novels such as the jin ping mei yet even gentry and scholarofficials were affected by the new popular romantic literature seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate painting of flowers a butterfly and rock sculpture by chen hongshou – small leaf album paintings like this one first became popular in the song dynasty famous painters included ni zan and dong qichang as well as the four masters of the ming dynasty shen zhou tang yin wen zhengming and qiu ying they drew upon the techniques styles and complexity in painting achieved by their song and yuan predecessors but added techniques and styles wellknown ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art the artist qiu ying was once paid  kg  oz of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were fulltime painters ming dynasty xuande mark and period – imperial blue and white vase metropolitan museum of art new york the period was also renowned for ceramics and porcelainsthe major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at jingdezhen in jiangxi province and dehua in fujian province the dehua porcelain factories catered to european tastes by creating chinese export porcelain by the th century individual potters also became known such as he chaozong who became famous in the early th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture in the ceramic trade in asia chuimei ho estimates that about  of late ming era chinese ceramic exports were sent to europe while the rest were destined for japan and south east asia carved designs in lacquerware and designs glazed onto porcelain wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting these items could be found in the homes of the wealthy alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade ivory and cloisonné the houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework the writing materials in a scholars private study including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal connoisseurship in the late ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions the jesuit matteo ricci while staying in nanjing wrote that chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits however there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur liu tong died  wrote a book printed in  that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art he revealed that a xuande era – bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen porcelain wares from the yongle era – could be judged authentic by their thickness religion see also islam during the ming dynasty jesuit china missions and chinese rites controversy chinese glazed stoneware statue of a daoist deity from the ming dynasty th century the dominant religious beliefs during the ming dynasty were the various forms of chinese folk religion and the three teachings – confucianism taoism and buddhism the yuansupported tibetan lamas fell from favor and the early ming emperors particularly favored taoism granting its practitioners many positions in the states ritual offices the hongwu emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the mongol yuan dynasty and the prolific prince of ning zhu quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking buddhism as a foreign mourning cult deleterious to the state and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the taoist canon islam was also wellestablished throughout china with a history said to have begun with sad ibn abi waqqas during the tang dynasty and strong official support during the yuan although the ming sharply curtailed this support there were still several prominent muslim figures early on including the hongwu emperors generals chang yuqun lan yu ding dexing and mu ying as well as the yongle emperors powerful eunuch zheng he bodhisattva manjusri in blancdechine by he chaozong th century song yingxing devoted an entire section of his book to the ceramics industry in the making of porcelain items like this the advent of the ming was initially devastating to christianity in his first year the hongwu emperor declared the eightyyearold franciscan missions among the yuan heterodox and illegal the centuriesold nestorian church also disappeared during the later ming a new wave of christian missionaries arrived – particularly jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st pauls college on macau after its founding in  the most influential was matteo ricci whose map of the myriad countries of the world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with the convert xu guangqi led to the first chinese translation of euclids elements in  the discovery of a nestorian stele at xian in  also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the nanjing incident of  which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced the others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by the chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de ursis – and a return by the jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the confucian mold restored their fortunes however by the end of the ming the dominicans had begun the chinese rites controversy in rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of christianity under the qing dynasty during his mission ricci was also contacted in beijing by one of the approximately  kaifeng jews and introduced them and their long history in china to europe however the  flood caused by kaifengs ming governor devastated the community which lost five of its twelve families its synagogue and most of its torah philosophy wang yangmings confucianism wang yangming – considered the most influential confucian thinker since zhu xi during the ming dynasty the neoconfucian doctrines of the song scholar zhu xi were embraced by the court and the chinese literati at large although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the yongle emperors extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of fang xiaoru in  the ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming – whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xis concept of the extension of knowledge  or  gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as confucius and mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the classics but not experienced the real world conservative reaction a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to the zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholarbureaucrats were wary of wangs heterodoxy the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer wang yangmings disciple and saltmine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he xinyin  challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests the liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by the censorate and by the donglin academy reestablished in  these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu xiancheng – argued against wangs idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court urban and rural life a ming dynasty red lacquer box with intricate carving of people in the countryside surrounded by a floral border design wang gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the song dynasty – communities in ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city not only was the blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations chinese  since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth emperor minghuangs journey to sichuan a ming dynasty painting after qiu ying – a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a fathers line of work this would include – but was not limited to – coffinmakers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodlemakers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a protobanking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of the huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised the cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in the south the myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more ownercultivators north of the huai river due to harsher climate living not far above

the song dynasty the ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the western world in fact key advances in chinese science in the late ming were spurred by contact with europe in  johann adam schall von bell wrote the first chinese treatise on the telescope the yuanjingshuo far seeing optic glass in  the chongzhen emperor acquired the telescope of the late johann schreck – the heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the catholic missionaries in china but johannes kepler and galileo galileis ideas slowly trickled into china starting with the polish jesuit michael boym – in  adam schall von bells treatise in  and finally joseph edkins alex wylie and john fryer in the th century catholic jesuits in china would promote copernican theory at court yet at the same time embrace the ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until  that catholic missionaries in china sponsored the heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo – and guo shoujing – had laid the basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until  with the efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during the late ming for example the field mill the chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at  ¼ days giving an error of  min and  sec a year or roughly a full day every  years although the ming had adopted guo shoujings shoushi calendar of  which was just as accurate as the gregorian calendar the ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the ming and the statutes of the ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixthgeneration descendant of the hongxi emperor the prince zhu zaiyu – submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in  but the ultraconservative astronomical commission rejected it this was the same zhu zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin – in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in  a year earlier the memorial of xing yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the supervisor of the astronomical bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy xing would later serve with xu guangqi in reforming the calendar chinese  in  according to western standards a point compass chart employed by zheng he during his explorations when the ming founder hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the yuan dynastys palace at khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets selfoperating tiger automata dragonheaded devices that spouted mists of perfume and mechanical clocks in the tradition of yi xing – and su song – – he associated all of them with the decadence of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by the divisional director of the ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that thcentury european clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments  with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese  chinese records – namely the yuan shi chinese  – describe the fivewheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl – which featured the scoop wheel of su songs earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of the time this sanddriven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou shuxue fl – who added a fourth large gear wheel changed gear ratios and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often portrait of matteo ricci by yu wenhui latinized as emmanuel pereira dated the year of riccis death  the chinese were intrigued with european technology but so were visiting europeans of chinese technology in  abraham ortelius – featured in his atlas theatrum orbis terrarum the peculiar chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages just like chinese ships gonzales de mendoza also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on chinese silken robes – while gerardus mercator – featured them in his atlas john milton – in one of his famous poems and andreas everardus van braam houckgeest – in the writings of his travel diary in china the encyclopedist song yingxing – documented a wide array of technologies metallurgic and industrial processes in his tiangong kaiwu chinese  encyclopedia of  this includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a stillhead that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of

– took an interest in irrigation fertilizers famine relief economic and textile crops and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry there were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty but by the mid to late ming the chinese began to frequently employ europeanstyle artillery and firearms the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen sometime before the latters death on  may  with a preface added by jiao in  featured many types of cuttingedge gunpowder weaponry for the time this includes hollow gunpowderfilled exploding cannonballs land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights pins and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses naval mines finmounted

text with  entries each entry with its own name called a gang the mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name inoculation although it can be traced to earlier chinese folk medicine was detailed in chinese texts by the sixteenth century throughout the ming dynasty around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox in regards to oral hygiene the ancient egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end but the chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in  although it used stiff pig hair population appreciating plums by chen hongshou – showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the ming dynasty the historian timothy brook notes that the ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the ming even adult women were underreported for example the daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of  males and  females in  the government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide the practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however the dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding  by  cant likely be explained by infanticide alone the xuande emperor r – he stated in  that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but the population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen – governor of south zhili – in his  report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce the number of people counted in the census of  was  however this number dropped significantly when the government found that some  million people were missing from the tax census of  even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in  the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace the government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of  people in  in his studies on the population of china ho pingti suggests revising the  census to  million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after  ranged between  and  million while the population was in fact increasing even the hongzhi emperor r – remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around  the population of china was perhaps  million people citing heijdra and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using the gazetteers brook estimates that the overall population under the chenghua emperor r – was roughly  million despite midming census figures hovering around  million while prefectures across the empire in the midming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or woodcutters that contributed to deforestation the hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region while the jiajing emperor r – finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with the jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by the late ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since  fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps  million in the late ming dynasty while brook estimates  million and ebrey states perhaps as large as  million however a great epidemic that entered china through the northwest in  ravaged the densely populated areas along the grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that  of the local populace in one area was dead by  see also list of emperors of the ming dynasty ming emperors family tree economy of the ming dynasty taxation in premodern china ye chunji for further information on rural economics

military history naval history this box view talk edit the ming dynasty was the ruling dynasty of china – then known as the empire of the great ming – for  years – following the collapse of the mongolled yuan dynasty the ming described by edwin o reischauer john k fairbank and albert m craig as one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history was the last imperial dynasty in china ruled by ethnic han chinese although the primary capital of beijing fell in  to a rebellion led by li zicheng who established the shun dynasty soon replaced by the manchuled qing dynasty regimes loyal to the ming throne – collectively called the southern ming – survived until  the hongwu emperor ruled – attempted to create a society of selfsufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty the empires standing army exceeded one million troops and the navys dockyards in nanjing were the largest in the world he also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates enfeoffing his many sons throughout china and attempting to guide these princes through the huang ming zu xun a set of published dynastic instructions this failed spectacularly when his teenage successor the jianwen emperor attempted to curtail his uncles power prompting the jingnan campaign an uprising that placed the prince of yan upon the throne as the yongle emperor in  the yongle emperor established yan as a secondary capital and renamed it beijing constructed the forbidden city and restored the grand canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments he rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the confucian scholarbureaucrats one zheng he led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the indian ocean as far as arabia and the eastern coasts of africa the rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances the capture of the zhengtong emperor during the  tumu crisis ended them completely the imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the great wall of china into its modern form wideranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at nanjing hampered accurate figures estimates for the lateming population vary from  to  million but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or donated their lands to taxexempt eunuchs or temples haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from japanese pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves by the th century however the expansion of european trade – albeit restricted to islands near guangzhou like macau – spread the columbian exchange of crops plants and animals into china introducing chili peppers to sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes which diminished famines and spurred population growth the growth of portuguese spanish and dutch trade created new demand for chinese products and produced a massive influx of japanese and american silver this abundance of specie remonetized the

china the ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the mongols to attack in  the ming sent a military campaign to attack naghachu which concluded with the surrender of naghachu and ming conquest of manchuria the early ming court could not and did not aspire to the control imposed upon the jurchens in manchuria by the mongols yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers by the end of the hongwu reign the essentials of a policy toward the jurchens had taken shape most of the inhabitants of manchuria except for the wild jurchens were at peace with china the ming had created many guards  wei in manchuria but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control in  the ming dynasty under yongle emperor established the nurgan regional military commission on the banks of the amur river and yishiha a eunuch of haixi jurchen derivation was ordered to

commanderies overseeing tibetan administration while also renewing titles of exyuan dynasty officials from tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of tibetan buddhist sects however turrell v wylie states that censorship in the mingshi in favor of bolstering the ming emperors prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of sinotibetan relations during the ming era modern scholars debate whether the ming dynasty had sovereignty over tibet some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the jiajing emperor r – persecuted buddhism in favor of daoism at court others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship others note the ming need for central asian horses and the need to maintain the teahorse trade the ming sporadically sent armed forays into tibet during the th century which the tibetans successfully resisted several scholars point out that unlike the preceding mongols the ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in tibet the wanli emperor r – attempted to reestablish sinotibetan relations in the wake of a mongoltibetan alliance initiated in  an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent manchu qing dynasty – in their support for the dalai lama of the yellow hat sect by the late th

young jianwen from corrupting officials zhu di personally led forces in the revolt the palace in nanjing was burned to the ground along with jianwen himself his wife mother and courtiers zhu di

forced to commit suicide while the yongle emperor had staged five major offensives north of the great wall against the mongols and the oirats the constant threat of oirat incursions prompted the ming authorities to fortify the great wall from the late th century to the th century nevertheless john fairbank notes that it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed chinas siege

new tokugawa regime of japan shut down most of its foreign trade with european powers cutting off another source of silver coming into china these events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces people began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline in the s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver by  that sum could fetch half an ounce and by  only onethird of an ounce for peasants this meant economic disaster since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper famines became common in northern china in the early th century because of

semiautonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the yuan ming and qing dynasties copied on the yuan model the ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions one civil one military and one for surveillance below the level of the province sheng  were prefectures fu

the ming and qing dynasties from  until  when the republic of china evicted puyi from the inner court departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the three departments and six ministries system which was instituted by various dynasties since late han  bce –  ce the ming administration had only one department the secretariat that controlled the six ministries following the execution of the chancellor hu weiyong in  the hongwu emperor abolished the secretariat the censorate and the chief military commission and personally took charge of the six ministries and the regional five military commissions thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers the grand secretariat at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork was instituted but without employing grand counselors or chancellors the hongwu emperor sent his heir apparent to shaanxi in  to tour and soothe xunfu the region in  the yongle emperor commissioned  officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties by  these xunfu assignments became institutionalized as grand coordinators hence the censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors later with censorsinchief by  the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censorinchief or assistant censorinchief and were allowed direct access to the emperor as in prior dynasties the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the censorate censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early ming the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the s by the late ming dynasty there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment grand secretariat and six ministries a portrait of jiang shunfu an official under the hongzhi emperor now in the nanjing museum the decoration of two cranes on his chest is a rank badge that indicates he was a civil official of the first rank governmental institutions in china conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus reflecting its own particular interests the ming administration utilized grand secretaries to assist the emperor handling paperwork under the reign of the yongle emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and grand preceptor a topranking nonfunctional civil service post under the hongxi emperor ruled – the grand secretariat drew its members from the hanlin academy and were considered part of the imperial authority not the ministerial one hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times the secretariat operated as a coordinating agency whereas the six ministries—personnel revenue rites war justice and public works—were direct administrative organs of the state the ministry of personnel was in charge of appointments merit ratings promotions and demotions of officials as well as granting of honorific titles the ministry of revenue was in charge of gathering census data collecting taxes and handling state revenues while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it the ministry of rites was in charge of state ceremonies rituals and sacrifices it also oversaw registers for buddhist and daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states the ministry of war was in charge of the appointments promotions and demotions of military officers the maintenance of military installations equipment and weapons as well as the courier system the ministry of justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes but had no supervisory role over the censorate or the grand court of revision the ministry of public works had charge of government construction projects hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service manufacturing government equipment the maintenance of roads and canals standardization of weights and measures and the gathering of resources from the countryside bureaus and offices for the imperial household ming coinage –th century the imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus female servants were organized into the bureau of palace attendance bureau of ceremonies bureau of apparel bureau of foodstuffs bureau of the bedchamber bureau of handicrafts and office of staff surveillance starting in the s eunuchs began taking over these ladies positions until only the bureau of apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the directorate of palace attendants but as eunuch power at court increased so did their administrative offices with eventual twelve directorates four offices and eight bureaus the dynasty had a vast imperial household staffed with thousands of eunuchs who were headed by the directorate of palace attendants the eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance ceremonial rites food utensils documents stables seals apparel and so on the offices were in charge of providing fuel music paper and baths the bureaus were in charge of weapons silverwork laundering headgear bronzework textile manufacture wineries and gardens at times the most influential eunuch in the directorate of ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies there was a civil service office called the seal office which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals tallies and stamps there were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes personnel scholarofficials candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk by qiu ying – the hongwu emperor from  to  staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only after that the scholarofficials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the sui dynasty – theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials although it was frowned upon for merchants to join in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class however the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials this was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions where education was the most advanced the expansion of the printing industry since song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces for young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary for adult examination candidates there were massproduced inexpensive volumes of confucian classics and successful examination answers as in earlier periods the focus of the examination was classical confucian texts while the bulk of test material centered on the four books outlined by zhu xi in the th century ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the  requirement of completing the eightlegged essay a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends the exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades each grade divided into two degrees with ranging salaries nominally paid in piculs of rice according to their rank while provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to lowranking posts like the county graduates those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi presented scholar degree and assured a highlevel position in  years of ming rule and ninety palace examinations the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was  ebrey states that there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time on the order of one out of  adult males this was in comparison to the  shengyuan government students the lowest tier of graduates by the th century the maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade  and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over  school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years the chief instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a secondgrade county graduate the supervisorate of imperial instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne this office was headed by a grand supervisor of instruction who was ranked as first class of grade three lesser functionaries the xuande emperor playing chuiwan with his eunuchs a game similar to golf by an anonymous court painter of the xuande period – scholarofficials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of nonranked personnel called lesser functionaries they outnumbered officials by four to one charles hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as  throughout the empire these lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank the one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries eunuchs princes and generals detail of the emperors approach showing the wanli emperors royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry full panoramic painting here eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the ming dynasty one of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the eastern depot at the beginning of the dynasty later the western depot this secret service was overseen by the directorate of ceremonial hence this state organs often totalitarian affiliation eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks only theirs had four grades instead of nine descendants of the first ming emperor were made princes and given typically nominal military commands annual stipends and large estates the title used was king  wáng but – unlike the princes in the han and jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories the princes did not serve any administrative function and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors the rebellion of the prince of yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes but once the yongle emperor was enthroned he continued his nephews policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border although princes served no organ of state administration the princes consorts of the imperial princesses and ennobled relatives did staff the imperial clan court which supervised the imperial genealogy like scholarofficials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely meritbased and confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence wu over the cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after  the military even held their own examinations to test military skills in addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the yuan period the ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector in the early half of the dynasty men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them society and culture literature and arts further information ming dynasty painting and ming poetry lofty mount lu by shen zhou  literature painting poetry music and chinese opera of various types flourished during the ming dynasty especially in the economically prosperous lower yangzi valley although short fiction had been popular as far back as the tang dynasty – and the works of contemporaneous authors such as xu guangqi xu xiake and song yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel while the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of classical chinese those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families merchants and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed vernacular chinese literati scholars edited or developed major chinese novels into mature form in this period such as water margin and journey to the west jin ping mei published in  although incorporating earlier material marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology in the later years of the dynasty feng menglong and ling mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction theater scripts were equally imaginative the most famous the peony pavilion was written by tang xianzu – with its first performance at the pavilion of prince teng in  informal essay and travel writing was another highlight xu xiake – a travel literature author published his travel diaries in  written characters with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy the first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in beijing was in  by  the beijing gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing the new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late ming period for the readership of the merchant class poetry of min ding th century in contrast to xu xiake who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature the chinese poet and official yuan hongdao – used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with confucian court politics yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholarofficial this antiofficial sentiment in yuans travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the song dynasty poet and official su shi – yuan hongdao and his two brothers yuan zongdao – and yuan zhongdao – were the founders of the gongan school of letters this highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism which was also apparent in ming vernacular novels such as the jin ping mei yet even gentry and scholarofficials were affected by the new popular romantic literature seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate painting of flowers a butterfly and rock sculpture by chen hongshou – small leaf album paintings like this one first became popular in the song dynasty famous painters included ni zan and dong qichang as well as the four masters of the ming dynasty shen zhou tang yin wen zhengming and qiu ying they drew upon the techniques styles and complexity in painting achieved by their song and yuan predecessors but added techniques and styles wellknown ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art the artist qiu ying was once paid  kg  oz of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were fulltime painters ming dynasty xuande mark and period – imperial blue and white vase metropolitan museum of art new york the period was also renowned for ceramics and porcelainsthe major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at jingdezhen in jiangxi province and dehua in fujian province the dehua porcelain factories catered to european tastes by creating chinese export porcelain by the th century individual potters also became known such as he chaozong who became famous in the early th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture in the ceramic trade in asia chuimei ho estimates that about  of late ming era chinese ceramic exports were sent to europe while the rest were destined for japan and south east asia carved designs in lacquerware and designs glazed onto porcelain wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting these items could be found in the homes of the wealthy alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade ivory and cloisonné the houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework the writing materials in a scholars private study including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal connoisseurship in the late ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions the jesuit matteo ricci while staying in nanjing wrote that chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits however there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur liu tong died  wrote a book printed in  that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art he revealed that a xuande era – bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen porcelain wares from the yongle era – could be judged authentic by their thickness religion see also islam during the ming dynasty jesuit china missions and chinese rites controversy chinese glazed stoneware statue of a daoist deity from the ming dynasty th century the dominant religious beliefs during the ming dynasty were the various forms of chinese folk religion and the three teachings – confucianism taoism and buddhism the yuansupported tibetan lamas fell from favor and the early ming emperors particularly favored taoism granting its practitioners many positions in the states ritual offices the hongwu emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the mongol yuan dynasty and the prolific prince of ning zhu quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking buddhism as a foreign mourning cult deleterious to the state and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the taoist canon islam was also wellestablished throughout china with a history said to have begun with sad ibn abi waqqas during the tang dynasty and strong official support during the yuan although the ming sharply curtailed this support there were still several prominent muslim figures early on including the hongwu emperors generals chang yuqun lan yu ding dexing and mu ying as well as the yongle emperors powerful eunuch zheng he bodhisattva manjusri in blancdechine by he chaozong th century song yingxing devoted an entire section of his book to the ceramics industry in the making of porcelain items like this the advent of the ming was initially devastating to christianity in his first year the hongwu emperor declared the eightyyearold franciscan missions among the yuan heterodox and illegal the centuriesold nestorian church also disappeared during the later ming a new wave of christian missionaries arrived – particularly jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st pauls college on macau after its founding in  the most influential was matteo ricci whose map of the myriad countries of the world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with the convert xu guangqi led to the first chinese translation of euclids elements in  the discovery of a nestorian stele at xian in  also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the nanjing incident of  which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced the others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by the chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de ursis – and a return by the jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the confucian mold restored their fortunes however by the end of the ming the dominicans had begun the chinese rites controversy in rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of christianity under the qing dynasty during his mission ricci was also contacted in beijing by one of the approximately  kaifeng jews and introduced them and their long history in china to europe however the  flood caused by kaifengs ming governor devastated the community which lost five of its twelve families its synagogue and most of its torah philosophy wang yangmings confucianism wang yangming – considered the most influential confucian thinker since zhu xi during the ming dynasty the neoconfucian doctrines of the song scholar zhu xi were embraced by the court and the chinese literati at large although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the yongle emperors extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of fang xiaoru in  the ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming – whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xis concept of the extension of knowledge  or  gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as confucius and mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the classics but not experienced the real world conservative reaction a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to the zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholarbureaucrats were wary of wangs heterodoxy the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer wang yangmings disciple and saltmine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he xinyin  challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests the liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by the censorate and by the donglin academy reestablished in  these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu xiancheng – argued against wangs idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court urban and rural life a ming dynasty red lacquer box with intricate carving of people in the countryside surrounded by a floral border design wang gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the song dynasty – communities in ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city not only was the blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations chinese  since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth emperor minghuangs journey to sichuan a ming dynasty painting after qiu ying – a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a fathers line of work this would include – but was not limited to – coffinmakers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodlemakers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a protobanking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of the huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised the cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in the south the myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more ownercultivators north of the huai river due to harsher climate living not far above

the song dynasty the ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the western world in fact key advances in chinese science in the late ming were spurred by contact with europe in  johann adam schall von bell wrote the first chinese treatise on the telescope the yuanjingshuo far seeing optic glass in  the chongzhen emperor acquired the telescope of the late johann schreck – the heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the catholic missionaries in china but johannes kepler and galileo galileis ideas slowly trickled into china starting with the polish jesuit michael boym – in  adam schall von bells treatise in  and finally joseph edkins alex wylie and john fryer in the th century catholic jesuits in china would promote copernican theory at court yet at the same time embrace the ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until  that catholic missionaries in china sponsored the heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo – and guo shoujing – had laid the basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until  with the efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during the late ming for example the field mill the chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at  ¼ days giving an error of  min and  sec a year or roughly a full day every  years although the ming had adopted guo shoujings shoushi calendar of  which was just as accurate as the gregorian calendar the ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the ming and the statutes of the ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixthgeneration descendant of the hongxi emperor the prince zhu zaiyu – submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in  but the ultraconservative astronomical commission rejected it this was the same zhu zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin – in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in  a year earlier the memorial of xing yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the supervisor of the astronomical bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy xing would later serve with xu guangqi in reforming the calendar chinese  in  according to western standards a point compass chart employed by zheng he during his explorations when the ming founder hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the yuan dynastys palace at khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets selfoperating tiger automata dragonheaded devices that spouted mists of perfume and mechanical clocks in the tradition of yi xing – and su song – – he associated all of them with the decadence of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by the divisional director of the ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that thcentury european clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments  with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese  chinese records – namely the yuan shi chinese  – describe the fivewheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl – which featured the scoop wheel of su songs earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of the time this sanddriven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou shuxue fl – who added a fourth large gear wheel changed gear ratios and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often portrait of matteo ricci by yu wenhui latinized as emmanuel pereira dated the year of riccis death  the chinese were intrigued with european technology but so were visiting europeans of chinese technology in  abraham ortelius – featured in his atlas theatrum orbis terrarum the peculiar chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages just like chinese ships gonzales de mendoza also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on chinese silken robes – while gerardus mercator – featured them in his atlas john milton – in one of his famous poems and andreas everardus van braam houckgeest – in the writings of his travel diary in china the encyclopedist song yingxing – documented a wide array of technologies metallurgic and industrial processes in his tiangong kaiwu chinese  encyclopedia of  this includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a stillhead that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a ripcord and steel flint wheel a cannon from the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen before the latters death in  focusing on agriculture in his nongzheng quanshu the agronomist xu guangqi – took an interest in irrigation fertilizers famine relief economic and textile crops and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry there were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty but by the mid to late ming the chinese began to frequently employ europeanstyle artillery and firearms the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen sometime before the latters death on  may  with a preface added by jiao in  featured many types of cuttingedge gunpowder weaponry for the time this includes hollow gunpowderfilled exploding cannonballs land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights pins and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses naval mines finmounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile shaped like a dragons head and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels li shizhen – – one of the most renowned pharmacologists and physicians in chinese history – belonged to the late ming period his bencao gangmu is a medical text with  entries each entry with its own name called a gang the mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name inoculation although it can be traced to earlier chinese folk medicine was detailed in chinese texts by the sixteenth century throughout the ming dynasty around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox in regards to oral hygiene the ancient egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end but the chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in  although it used stiff pig hair population appreciating plums by chen hongshou – showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the ming dynasty the historian timothy brook notes that the ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the ming even adult women were underreported for example the daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of  males and  females in  the government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide the practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however the dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding  by  cant likely be explained by infanticide alone the xuande emperor r – he stated in  that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but the population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen – governor of south zhili – in his  report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce the number of people counted in the census of  was  however this number dropped significantly when the government found that some  million people were missing from the tax census of  even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in  the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace the government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of  people in  in his studies on the population of china ho pingti suggests revising the  census to  million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after  ranged between  and  million while the population was in fact increasing even the hongzhi emperor r – remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around  the population of china was perhaps  million people citing heijdra and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using the gazetteers brook estimates that the overall population under the chenghua emperor r – was roughly  million despite midming census figures hovering around  million while prefectures across the empire in the midming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or woodcutters that contributed to deforestation the hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region while the jiajing emperor r – finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with the jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by the late ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since  fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps  million in the late ming dynasty while brook estimates  million and ebrey states perhaps as large as  million however a great epidemic that entered china through the northwest in  ravaged the densely populated areas along the grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that  of the local populace in one

military history naval history this box view talk edit the ming dynasty was the ruling dynasty of china – then known as the empire of the great ming – for  years – following the collapse of the mongolled yuan dynasty the ming described by edwin o reischauer john k fairbank and albert m craig as one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history was the last imperial dynasty in china ruled by ethnic han chinese although the primary capital of beijing fell in  to a rebellion led by li zicheng who established the shun dynasty soon replaced by the manchuled qing dynasty regimes loyal to the ming throne – collectively called the southern ming – survived until  the hongwu emperor ruled – attempted to create a society of selfsufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty the empires standing army exceeded one million troops and the navys dockyards in nanjing were the largest in the world he also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates enfeoffing his many sons throughout china and attempting to guide these princes through the huang ming zu xun a set of published dynastic instructions this failed spectacularly when his teenage successor the jianwen emperor attempted to curtail his uncles power prompting the jingnan campaign an uprising that placed the prince of yan upon the throne as the yongle emperor in  the yongle emperor established yan as a secondary capital and renamed it beijing constructed the forbidden city and restored the grand canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments he rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the confucian scholarbureaucrats one zheng he led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the indian ocean as far as arabia and the eastern coasts of africa the rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances the capture of the zhengtong emperor during the  tumu crisis ended them completely the imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the great wall of china into its modern form wideranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at nanjing hampered accurate figures estimates for the lateming population vary from  to  million but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or donated their lands to taxexempt eunuchs or temples haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from japanese pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves by the th century however the expansion of european trade – albeit restricted to islands near guangzhou like macau – spread the columbian exchange of crops plants and animals into china introducing chili peppers to sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes which diminished famines and spurred population growth the growth of portuguese spanish and dutch trade created new demand for chinese products and produced a massive influx of japanese and american silver this abundance of specie remonetized the ming economy whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted while traditional confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created the heterodoxy introduced by wang yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude zhang juzhengs initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the little ice age joined changes in japanese and spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers to be able to pay their taxes combined with crop failure floods and epidemic the

of the yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against han chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion overtaxation of areas hardhit by inflation and massive flooding of the yellow river as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects consequently agriculture and the economy were in shambles and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the yellow river a number of han chinese groups revolted including the red turbans in  the red turbans were affiliated with the white lotus a buddhist secret society zhu yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and buddhist monk who joined the red turbans in  he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander in  zhus rebel force captured the city of nanjing which he would later establish as the capital of the ming dynasty with the yuan dynasty crumbling competing rebel groups began fighting for control of the country and thus the right to establish a new dynasty in  zhu yuanzhang eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel han faction chen youliang in the battle of lake poyang arguably the largest naval battle in history known for its ambitious use of fire ships zhus force of  ming sailors were able to defeat a han rebel force over triple their size claimed to be strong the victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction leaving zhu yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful yangtze river valley and cementing his power in the south after the dynastic head of the red turbans suspiciously died in  while a guest of zhu there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the yuan capital dadu presentday beijing in  the last yuan emperor fled north to the upper capital shangdu and zhu declared the founding of the ming dynasty after razing the yuan palaces in dadu to the ground the city was renamed beiping in the same year zhu yuanzhang took hongwu or vastly martial as his era name reign of the hongwu emperor portrait of the hongwu emperor ruled in – hongwu made an immediate effort to rebuild state infrastructure he built a  km  mi long wall around nanjing as well as new palaces and government halls the history of ming states that as early as  zhu yuanzhang had begun drafting a new confucian law code the da ming lü which was completed by  and repeated certain clauses found in the old tang code of  hongwu organized a military system known as the weisuo which was similar to the fubing system of the tang dynasty – in  hongwu had the chancellor hu weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him after that hongwu abolished the chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor a precedent mostly followed throughout the ming period with a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects hongwu established the jinyiwei a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard some  people were executed in a series of purges during his rule the hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify china of barbarian influence however he also sought to use the yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in china and other areas ruled by the yuan he adopted many yuan military practices recruited mongol soldiers and continued to request korean concubines and eunuchs southwestern frontier main article ming conquest of yunnan the old south gate of the ancient city of dali yunnan in qinghai the salar muslims voluntarily came under ming rule their clan leaders capitulating around  uyghur troops under uyghur general hala bashi suppressed the miao rebellions of the s and settled in changde hunan hui muslim troops also settled in changde hunan after serving the ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes in  the ming dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the kingdom of dali following the successful effort by hui muslim ming armies to defeat yuanloyalist mongol and hui muslim troops holding out in yunnan province the hui troops under general mu ying who was appointed governor of yunnan were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort by the end of the th century some  military colonists settled some  mu  acres of land in what is now yunnan and guizhou roughly half a million more chinese settlers came in later periods these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic makeup of the region since formerly more than half of the population were nonhan peoples resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more miao and yao revolts in  to  which were crushed by an army of  ming troops including  mongols joining the  local guangxi see miao rebellions ming dynasty after the scholar and philosopher wang yangming – suppressed another rebellion in the region he advocated single unitary administration of chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification of the local peoples campaign in the northeast main article manchuria under ming rule the great wall of china although the rammed earth walls of the ancient warring states were combined into a unified wall under the qin and han dynasties the vast majority of the brick and stone great wall seen today is a product of the ming dynasty after the overthrow of the mongol yuan dynasty by the ming dynasty in  manchuria remained under control of the mongols of the northern yuan dynasty based in mongolia naghachu a former yuan official and a uriankhai general of the northern yuan dynasty won hegemony over the mongol tribes in manchuria liaoyang province of the former yuan dynasty he grew strong in the northeast with forces large enough numbering hundreds of thousands to threaten invasion of the newly founded ming dynasty in order to restore the mongols to power in china the ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the mongols to attack in  the ming sent a military campaign to attack naghachu which concluded with the surrender of naghachu and ming conquest of manchuria the early ming court could not and did not aspire to the control imposed upon the jurchens in manchuria by the mongols yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers by the end of the hongwu reign the essentials of a policy toward the jurchens had taken shape most of the inhabitants of manchuria except for the wild jurchens were at peace with china the ming had created many guards  wei in manchuria but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control in  the ming dynasty under yongle emperor established the nurgan regional military commission on the banks of the amur river and yishiha a eunuch of haixi jurchen derivation was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the amur to pacify the wild jurchens after the death of yongle emperor the nurgan regional military commission was abolished in  and the ming court ceased to have substantial activities there although the guards continued to exist in manchuria by the late ming period ming political presence in manchuria had waned considerably relations with tibet main article sinotibetan relations during the ming dynasty a thcentury tibetan thangka of guhyasamaja akshobhyavajra the ming dynasty court gathered various tribute items that were native products of tibet such as thangkas and in return granted gifts to tibetan tributebearers the mingshi – the official history of the ming dynasty compiled by the qing dynasty in  – states that the ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing tibetan administration while also renewing titles of exyuan dynasty officials from tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of tibetan buddhist sects however turrell v wylie states that censorship in the mingshi in favor of bolstering the ming emperors prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of sinotibetan relations during the ming era modern scholars debate whether the ming dynasty had sovereignty over tibet some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the jiajing emperor r – persecuted buddhism in favor of daoism at court others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship others note the ming need for central asian horses and the need to maintain the teahorse trade the ming sporadically sent armed forays into tibet during the th century which the tibetans successfully resisted several scholars point out that unlike the preceding mongols the ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in tibet the wanli emperor r – attempted to reestablish sinotibetan relations in the wake of a mongoltibetan alliance initiated in  an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent manchu qing dynasty – in their support for the dalai lama of the yellow hat sect by the late th century the mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the yellow hat dalai lama after their increasing presence in the amdo region culminating in the conquest of tibet by güshi khan – in  establishing the khoshut khanate reign of the yongle emperor main article yongle emperor rise to power portrait of the yongle emperor ruled in – the hongwu emperor specified his grandson zhu yunwen as his successor and he assumed the throne as the jianwen emperor – after hongwus death in  the most powerful of hongwus sons zhu di then the militarily mighty disagreed with this and soon a political showdown erupted between him and his nephew jianwen after jianwen arrested many of zhu dis associates zhu di plotted a rebellion that sparked a threeyear civil war under the pretext of rescuing the young jianwen from corrupting officials zhu di personally led forces in the revolt the palace in nanjing was burned to the ground along with jianwen himself his wife mother and courtiers zhu di assumed the throne as the yongle emperor – his reign is universally viewed by scholars as a second founding of the ming dynasty since he reversed many of his fathers policies new capital and foreign engagement yongle demoted nanjing to a secondary capital and in  announced the new capital of china was to be at his power base in beijing construction of a new city there lasted from  to  employing hundreds of thousands of workers daily at the center was the political node of the imperial city and at the center of this was the forbidden city the palatial residence of the emperor and his family by  the outer city was added to the south which brought the overall size of beijing to  by ½ miles the ming tombs located  km  mi north of beijing the site was chosen by yongle beginning in  the yongle emperor entrusted his favored eunuch commander zheng he – as the admiral for a gigantic new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions the chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land since the han dynasty  bce –  ce and engaged in private overseas trade but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and scale to service seven different tributary voyages the nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from  to  including treasure ships measuring  m  ft to  m  ft in length and  m  ft to  m  ft in width yongle also used woodblock printing to spread chinese culture and used the military especially cavalry to expand chinas borders this included the brief occupation of vietnam from the initial invasion in  until the ming withdrawal in  as a result of protracted guerrilla warfare led by the subsequent founder of the vietnamese lê dynasty tumu crisis and the ming mongols main articles tumu crisis and rebellion of cao qin a bengali envoys presented a tribute giraffe in the name of king saif aldin hamzah shah of bengal r – to the yongle emperor of ming china r – the oirat leader esen tayisi launched an invasion into ming china in july  the chief eunuch wang zhen encouraged the zhengtong emperor r – to lead a force personally to face the oirats after a recent ming defeat the emperor left the capital and put his halfbrother zhu qiyu in charge of affairs as temporary regent on  september esen routed zhengtongs army and zhengtong was captured – an event known as the tumu crisis the oirats held the zhengtong emperor for ransom however this scheme was foiled once the emperors younger brother assumed the throne under the era name jingtai r – the oirats were also repelled once the jingtai emperors confidant and defense minister yu qian – gained control of the ming armed forces holding the zhengtong emperor in captivity was a useless bargaining chip for the oirats as long as another sat on his throne so they released him back into ming china the former emperor was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against the jingtai emperor in  known as the wresting the gate incident the former emperor retook the throne under the new era name tianshun r – tianshun proved to be a troubled time and mongol forces within the ming military structure continued to be problematic on  august  the chinese general cao qin and his ming troops of mongol descent staged a coup against the tianshun emperor out of fear of being next on his purgelist of those who aided him in the wresting the gate incident caos rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the imperial city doused by rain during the battle and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide while the yongle emperor had staged five major offensives north of the great wall against the mongols and the oirats the constant threat of oirat incursions prompted the ming

financial drain of the imjin war in korea against the japanese was one of the many problems – fiscal or other – facing ming china during the reign of the wanli emperor – in the beginning of his reign wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs his grand secretary zhang juzheng – built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials however there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances officials soon banded together in opposing political factions over time wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers preferring to stay behind the walls of the forbidden city and out of his officials sight scholarofficials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his

yongle emperors reign and afterwards managed huge imperial workshops commanded armies and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials the eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the ming such as wang zhen wang zhi and liu jin excessive

spring morning in a han palace by qiu ying – excessive luxury and decadence marked the late ming period spurred by the enormous state bullion of incoming silver and by private transactions involving silver during the last years of the wanli era and those of his two successors an economic crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empires chief medium of exchange silver the portuguese first established trade with china in  trading japanese silver for chinese silk and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the ming court in  to settle macau as their permanent trade base in china their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the spanish while even the dutch challenged them for control of this trade philip iv of spain reigned – began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from new spain and peru across the pacific through the philippines towards china in favor of shipping americanmined silver through spanish ports in  the new tokugawa regime of japan shut down most of its foreign trade with european powers cutting off another source of silver coming into china these events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces people began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline in the s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver by  that sum could fetch half an ounce and by  only onethird of an ounce for peasants this meant economic disaster since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper famines became common in northern china in the early th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the little ice age famine alongside tax increases widespread military desertions a declining relief system and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and floodcontrol projects caused widespread loss of life and normal

the precursors of the modern provinces throughout the song dynasty the largest political division was the circuit lu  however after the jurchen invasion in  the song court established four semiautonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the yuan ming and qing dynasties copied on the yuan model the ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions one civil one military and one for surveillance below the level of the province sheng  were prefectures fu  operating under a prefect zhifu 知 followed by subprefectures zhou  under a subprefect the lowest unit was the county xian  overseen by a magistrate besides the provinces there were also two large areas that belonged to no province but were metropolitan areas jing  attached to nanjing and beijing institutions and bureaus institutional trends the forbidden city the official imperial household of the ming and qing dynasties from  until  when the republic of china evicted puyi from the inner court departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the three departments and six ministries system which was instituted by various dynasties since late han  bce –  ce the ming administration had only one department the secretariat that controlled the six ministries following the execution of the chancellor hu weiyong in  the hongwu emperor abolished the secretariat the censorate and the chief military commission and personally took charge of the six ministries and the regional five military commissions thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers the grand secretariat at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork was instituted but without employing grand counselors or chancellors the hongwu emperor sent his heir apparent to shaanxi in  to tour and soothe xunfu the region in  the yongle emperor commissioned  officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties by  these xunfu assignments became institutionalized as grand coordinators hence the censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors later with censorsinchief by  the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censorinchief or assistant censorinchief and were allowed direct access to the emperor as in prior dynasties the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the censorate censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early ming the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the s by the late ming dynasty there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment grand secretariat and six ministries a portrait of jiang shunfu an official under the hongzhi emperor now in the nanjing museum the decoration of two cranes on his chest is a rank badge that indicates he was a civil official of the first rank governmental institutions in china conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus reflecting its own particular interests the ming administration utilized grand secretaries to assist the emperor handling paperwork under the reign of the yongle emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and grand preceptor a topranking nonfunctional civil service post under the hongxi emperor ruled – the grand secretariat drew its members from the hanlin academy and were considered part of the imperial authority not the ministerial one hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times the secretariat operated as a coordinating agency whereas the six ministries—personnel revenue rites war justice and public works—were direct administrative organs of the state the ministry of personnel was in charge of appointments merit ratings promotions and demotions of officials as well as granting of honorific titles the ministry of revenue was in charge of gathering census data collecting taxes and handling state revenues while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it the ministry of rites was in charge of state ceremonies rituals and sacrifices it also oversaw registers for buddhist and daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states the ministry of war was in charge of the appointments promotions and demotions of military officers the maintenance of military installations equipment and weapons as well as the courier system the ministry of justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes but had no supervisory role over the censorate or the grand court of revision the ministry of public works had charge of government construction projects hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service manufacturing government equipment the maintenance of roads and canals standardization of weights and measures and the gathering of resources from the countryside bureaus and offices for the imperial household ming coinage –th century the imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus female servants were organized into the bureau of palace attendance bureau of ceremonies bureau of apparel bureau of foodstuffs bureau of the bedchamber bureau of handicrafts and office of staff surveillance starting in the s eunuchs began taking over these ladies positions until only the bureau of apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the directorate of palace attendants but as eunuch power at court increased so did their administrative offices with eventual twelve directorates four offices and eight bureaus the dynasty had a vast imperial household staffed with thousands of eunuchs who were headed by the directorate of palace attendants the eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance ceremonial rites food utensils documents stables seals apparel and so on the offices were in charge of providing fuel music paper and baths the bureaus were in charge of weapons silverwork laundering headgear bronzework textile manufacture wineries and gardens at times the most influential eunuch in the directorate of ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies there was a civil service office called the seal office which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals tallies and stamps there were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes personnel scholarofficials candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk by qiu ying – the hongwu emperor from  to  staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only after that the scholarofficials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the sui dynasty – theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials although it was frowned upon for merchants to join in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class however the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials this was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions where education was the most advanced the expansion of the printing industry since song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces for young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary for adult examination candidates there were massproduced inexpensive volumes of confucian classics and successful examination answers as in earlier periods the focus of the examination was classical confucian texts while the bulk of test material centered on the four books outlined by zhu xi in the th century ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the  requirement of completing the eightlegged essay a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends the exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades each grade divided into two degrees with ranging salaries nominally paid in piculs of rice according to their rank while provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to lowranking posts like the county graduates those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi presented scholar degree and assured a highlevel position in  years of ming rule and ninety palace examinations the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was  ebrey states that there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time on the order of one out of  adult males this was in comparison to the  shengyuan government students the lowest tier of graduates by the th century the maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade  and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over  school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years the chief instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a secondgrade county graduate the supervisorate of imperial instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne this office was headed by a grand supervisor of instruction who was ranked as first class of grade three lesser functionaries the xuande emperor playing chuiwan with his eunuchs a game similar to golf by an anonymous court painter of the xuande period – scholarofficials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of nonranked personnel called lesser functionaries they outnumbered officials by four to one charles hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as  throughout the empire these lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank the one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries eunuchs princes and generals detail of the emperors approach showing the wanli emperors royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry full panoramic painting here eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the ming dynasty one of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the eastern depot at the beginning of the dynasty later the western depot this secret service was overseen by the directorate of ceremonial hence this state organs often totalitarian affiliation eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks only theirs had four grades instead of nine descendants of the first ming emperor were made princes and given typically nominal military commands annual stipends and large estates the title used was king  wáng but – unlike the princes in the han and jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories the princes did not serve any administrative function and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors the rebellion of the prince of yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes but once the yongle emperor was enthroned he continued his nephews policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border although princes served no organ of state administration the princes consorts of the imperial princesses and ennobled relatives did staff the imperial clan court which supervised the imperial genealogy like scholarofficials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely meritbased and confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence wu over the cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after  the military even held their own examinations to test military skills in addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the yuan period the ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector in the early half of the dynasty men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them society and culture literature and arts further information ming dynasty painting and ming poetry lofty mount lu by shen zhou  literature painting poetry music and chinese opera of various types flourished during the ming dynasty especially in the economically prosperous lower yangzi valley although short fiction had been popular as far back as the tang dynasty – and the works of contemporaneous authors such as xu guangqi xu xiake and song yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel while the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of classical chinese those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families merchants and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed vernacular chinese literati scholars edited or developed major chinese novels into mature form in this period such as water margin and journey to the west jin ping mei published in  although incorporating earlier material marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology in the later years of the dynasty feng menglong and ling mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction theater scripts were equally imaginative the most famous the peony pavilion was written by tang xianzu – with its first performance at the pavilion of prince teng in  informal essay and travel writing was another highlight xu xiake – a travel literature author published his travel diaries in  written characters with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy the first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in beijing was in  by  the beijing gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing the new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late ming period for the readership of the merchant class poetry of min ding th century in contrast to xu xiake who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature the chinese poet and official yuan hongdao – used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with confucian court politics yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholarofficial this antiofficial sentiment in yuans travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the song dynasty poet and official su shi – yuan hongdao and his two brothers yuan zongdao – and yuan zhongdao – were the founders of the gongan school of letters this highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism which was also apparent in ming vernacular novels such as the jin ping mei yet even gentry and scholarofficials were affected by the new popular romantic literature seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate painting of flowers a butterfly and rock sculpture by chen hongshou – small leaf album paintings like this one first became popular in the song dynasty famous painters included ni zan and dong qichang as well as the four masters of the ming dynasty shen zhou tang yin wen zhengming and qiu ying they drew upon the techniques styles and complexity in painting achieved by their song and yuan predecessors but added techniques and styles wellknown ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art the artist qiu ying was once paid  kg  oz of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were fulltime painters ming dynasty xuande mark and period – imperial blue and white vase metropolitan museum of art new york the period was also renowned for ceramics and porcelainsthe major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at jingdezhen in jiangxi province and dehua in fujian province the dehua porcelain factories catered to european tastes by creating chinese export porcelain by the th century individual potters also became known such as he chaozong who became famous in the early th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture in the ceramic trade in asia chuimei ho estimates that about  of late ming era chinese ceramic exports were sent to europe while the rest were destined for japan and south east asia carved designs in lacquerware and designs glazed onto porcelain wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting these items could be found in the homes of the wealthy alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade ivory and cloisonné the houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework the writing materials in a scholars private study including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal connoisseurship in the late ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions the jesuit matteo ricci while staying in nanjing wrote that chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits however there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur liu tong died  wrote a book printed in  that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art he revealed that a xuande era – bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen porcelain wares from the yongle era – could be judged authentic by their thickness religion see also islam during the ming dynasty jesuit china missions and chinese rites controversy chinese glazed stoneware statue of a daoist deity from the ming dynasty th century the dominant religious beliefs during the ming dynasty were the various forms of chinese folk religion and the three teachings – confucianism taoism and buddhism the yuansupported tibetan lamas fell from favor and the early ming emperors particularly favored taoism granting its practitioners many positions in the states ritual offices the hongwu emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the mongol yuan dynasty and the prolific prince of ning zhu quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking buddhism as a foreign mourning cult deleterious to the state and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the taoist canon islam was also wellestablished throughout china with a history said to have begun with sad ibn abi waqqas during the tang dynasty and strong official support during the yuan although the ming sharply curtailed this support there were still several prominent muslim figures early on including the hongwu emperors generals chang yuqun lan yu ding dexing and mu ying as well as the yongle emperors powerful eunuch zheng he bodhisattva manjusri in blancdechine by he chaozong th century song yingxing devoted an entire section of his book to the ceramics industry in the making of porcelain items like this the advent of the ming was initially devastating to christianity in his first year the hongwu emperor declared the eightyyearold franciscan missions among the yuan heterodox and illegal the centuriesold nestorian church also disappeared during the later ming a new wave of christian missionaries arrived – particularly jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st pauls college on macau after its founding in  the most influential was matteo ricci whose map of the myriad countries of the world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with the convert xu guangqi led to the first chinese translation of euclids elements in  the discovery of a nestorian stele at xian in  also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the nanjing incident of  which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced the others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by the chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de ursis – and a return by the jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the confucian mold restored their fortunes however by the end of the ming the dominicans had begun the chinese rites controversy in rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of christianity under the qing dynasty during his mission ricci was also contacted in beijing by one of the approximately  kaifeng jews and introduced them and their long history in china to europe however the  flood caused by kaifengs ming governor devastated the community which lost five of its twelve families its synagogue and most of its torah philosophy wang yangmings confucianism wang yangming – considered the most influential confucian thinker since zhu xi during the ming dynasty the neoconfucian doctrines of the song scholar zhu xi were embraced by the court and the chinese literati at large although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the yongle emperors extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of fang xiaoru in  the ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming – whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xis concept of the extension of knowledge  or  gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as confucius and mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the classics but not experienced the real world conservative reaction a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to the zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholarbureaucrats were wary of wangs heterodoxy the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer wang yangmings disciple and saltmine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he xinyin  challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests the liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by the censorate and by the donglin academy reestablished in  these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu xiancheng – argued against wangs idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court urban and rural life a ming dynasty red lacquer box with intricate carving of people in the countryside surrounded by a floral border design wang gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the song dynasty – communities in ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city not only was the blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations chinese  since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth emperor minghuangs journey to sichuan a ming dynasty painting after qiu ying – a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a fathers line of work this would include – but was not limited to – coffinmakers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodlemakers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a protobanking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of the huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised the cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in the south the myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more ownercultivators north of the huai river due to harsher climate living not far above

promote copernican theory at court yet at the same time embrace the ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until  that catholic missionaries in china sponsored the heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo – and guo shoujing – had laid the basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until  with the efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during the late ming for example the field mill the chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at  ¼ days giving an error of  min and  sec a year or roughly a full day every  years although the ming had adopted guo shoujings shoushi calendar of  which was just as accurate as the gregorian calendar the ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the ming and the statutes of the ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixthgeneration descendant of the hongxi emperor the prince zhu zaiyu – submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in  but the ultraconservative astronomical commission rejected it this was the same zhu zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin – in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in  a year earlier the memorial of xing yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the supervisor of the astronomical bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy xing would later serve with xu guangqi in reforming the calendar chinese  in  according to western standards a point compass chart employed by zheng he during his explorations when the ming founder hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the yuan dynastys palace at khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets selfoperating tiger automata dragonheaded devices that spouted mists of perfume and mechanical clocks in the tradition of yi xing – and su song – – he associated all of them with the decadence of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by the divisional director of the ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that thcentury european clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments  with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese  chinese records – namely the yuan shi chinese  – describe the fivewheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl – which featured the scoop wheel of su songs earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of the time this sanddriven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou shuxue fl – who added a fourth large gear wheel changed gear ratios and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often portrait of matteo ricci by yu wenhui latinized as emmanuel pereira dated the year of riccis death  the chinese were intrigued with european technology but so were visiting europeans of chinese technology in  abraham ortelius – featured in his atlas theatrum orbis terrarum the peculiar chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages just like chinese ships gonzales de mendoza also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on chinese silken robes – while gerardus mercator – featured them in his atlas john milton – in one of his famous poems and andreas everardus van braam houckgeest – in the writings of his travel diary in china the encyclopedist song yingxing – documented a wide array of technologies metallurgic and industrial processes in his tiangong kaiwu chinese  encyclopedia of  this includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a stillhead that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a ripcord and steel flint wheel a cannon from the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen before the latters death in  focusing on agriculture in his nongzheng quanshu the agronomist xu guangqi – took an interest in irrigation fertilizers famine relief economic and textile crops and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry there were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty but by the mid to late ming the chinese began to frequently employ europeanstyle artillery and firearms the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen sometime before the latters death on  may  with a preface added by jiao in  featured many types of cuttingedge gunpowder weaponry for the time this includes hollow gunpowderfilled exploding cannonballs land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights pins and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses naval mines finmounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile shaped like a dragons head and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels li shizhen – – one of the most renowned pharmacologists and physicians in chinese history – belonged to the late ming period his bencao gangmu is a medical text with  entries each entry with its own name called a gang the mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name inoculation although it can be traced to earlier chinese folk medicine was detailed in chinese texts by the sixteenth century throughout the ming dynasty around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox in regards to oral hygiene the ancient egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end but the chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in  although it used stiff pig hair population appreciating plums by chen hongshou – showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the ming dynasty the historian timothy brook notes that the ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the ming even adult women were underreported for example the daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of  males and  females in  the government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide the practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however the dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding  by  cant likely be explained by infanticide alone the xuande emperor r – he stated in  that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but the population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen – governor of south zhili – in his  report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce the number of people counted in the census of  was  however this number dropped significantly when the government found that some  million people were missing from the tax census of  even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in  the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace the government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of  people in  in his studies on the population of china ho pingti suggests revising the  census to  million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after  ranged between  and  million while the population was in fact increasing even the hongzhi emperor r – remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around  the population of china was perhaps  million people citing heijdra and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using the gazetteers brook estimates that the overall population under the chenghua emperor r – was roughly  million despite midming census figures hovering around  million while prefectures across the empire in the midming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or woodcutters that contributed to deforestation the hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region while the jiajing emperor r – finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with the jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by the late ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since  fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps  million in the late ming dynasty while brook estimates  million and ebrey states perhaps as large as  million however a great epidemic that entered china through the northwest in  ravaged the densely populated areas along the grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that  of the local populace in one area was dead by  see also list of emperors of the ming dynasty ming emperors family tree economy of the ming dynasty taxation in premodern china ye chunji for further information on rural economics

mongolled yuan dynasty the ming described by edwin o reischauer john k fairbank and albert m craig as one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history was the last imperial dynasty in china ruled by ethnic han chinese although the primary capital of beijing fell in  to a rebellion led by li zicheng who established the shun dynasty soon replaced by the manchuled qing dynasty regimes loyal to the ming throne – collectively called the southern ming – survived until  the hongwu emperor ruled – attempted to create a society of selfsufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty the empires standing army exceeded one million troops and the navys dockyards in nanjing were the largest in the world he also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates enfeoffing his many sons throughout china and attempting to guide these princes through the huang ming zu xun a set of published dynastic instructions this failed spectacularly when his teenage successor the jianwen emperor attempted to curtail his uncles power prompting the jingnan campaign an uprising that placed the prince of yan upon the throne as the yongle emperor in  the yongle emperor established yan as a secondary capital and renamed it beijing constructed the forbidden city and restored the grand canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments he rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the confucian scholarbureaucrats one zheng he led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the indian ocean as far as arabia and the eastern coasts of africa the rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances the capture of the zhengtong emperor during the  tumu crisis ended them completely the imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the great wall of china into its modern form wideranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at nanjing hampered accurate figures estimates for the lateming population vary from  to  million but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or donated their lands to taxexempt eunuchs or temples haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from japanese pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves by the th century however the expansion of european trade – albeit restricted to islands near guangzhou like macau – spread the columbian exchange of crops plants and animals into china introducing chili peppers to sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes which diminished famines and spurred population growth the growth of portuguese spanish and dutch trade created new demand for chinese products and produced a massive influx of japanese and american silver this abundance of specie remonetized the ming economy whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted while traditional confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created the heterodoxy introduced by wang yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude zhang juzhengs initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the little ice

executive and emperor a precedent mostly followed throughout the ming period with a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects hongwu established the jinyiwei a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard some  people were executed in a series of purges during his rule the hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify china of barbarian influence however he also sought to use the yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in china and other areas ruled by the yuan he adopted many yuan military practices recruited

ying who was appointed governor of yunnan were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort by the end of the th century some  military colonists settled some  mu  acres of land in what is now yunnan and guizhou roughly half a million more chinese settlers came in later periods these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic makeup of the region since formerly more than half of the population were nonhan peoples resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more miao and yao revolts in  to  which were crushed by an army of  ming troops including  mongols joining the  local guangxi see miao rebellions ming dynasty after the scholar and philosopher wang yangming – suppressed another rebellion in the region he

rule the great wall of china although the rammed earth walls of the ancient warring states were combined into a unified wall under the qin and han dynasties the vast majority of the brick and stone great wall seen today is a product of the ming dynasty after the overthrow of the mongol yuan dynasty by the ming dynasty in  manchuria remained under control of the mongols of the northern yuan dynasty based in mongolia naghachu a former yuan official and a uriankhai general of the northern yuan dynasty won hegemony over the mongol tribes in manchuria liaoyang province of the former yuan dynasty he grew strong in the northeast with forces large enough numbering hundreds of thousands to threaten invasion of the newly founded ming dynasty in order to restore the mongols to power in china the ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the mongols to attack in  the ming sent a military campaign to attack naghachu which concluded with the surrender of naghachu and ming conquest of manchuria the early ming court could not and did not aspire to the control imposed upon the jurchens in manchuria by the mongols yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers by the end of the hongwu reign the essentials of a policy toward the jurchens had taken shape most of the inhabitants of manchuria except for the wild jurchens were at peace with china the ming had created many guards  wei in manchuria but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control in  the ming dynasty under yongle emperor established the nurgan regional military commission on the banks of the amur river and yishiha a eunuch of haixi jurchen derivation was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the amur to pacify the wild jurchens after the death of yongle emperor the nurgan regional military commission was abolished in  and the ming court ceased to have

sinotibetan relations during the ming dynasty a thcentury tibetan thangka of guhyasamaja akshobhyavajra the ming dynasty court gathered various tribute items that were native products of tibet such as thangkas and in return granted gifts to tibetan tributebearers the mingshi – the official history of the ming dynasty compiled by the qing dynasty in  – states that the ming established itinerant commanderies overseeing tibetan administration while also renewing titles of exyuan dynasty officials from tibet and conferring new princely titles on leaders of tibetan buddhist sects however turrell v wylie states that censorship in the mingshi in favor of bolstering the ming emperors prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of sinotibetan relations during the ming era modern scholars debate whether the ming dynasty had sovereignty over tibet some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the jiajing emperor r – persecuted buddhism in favor of daoism at court others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship others note the ming need for central asian horses and the need to maintain the teahorse trade the ming sporadically sent armed forays into tibet during the th century which the tibetans successfully resisted several scholars point out that unlike the preceding mongols the ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in tibet the wanli emperor r – attempted to reestablish sinotibetan relations in the wake of a mongoltibetan alliance initiated in  an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent manchu qing dynasty – in their support for the dalai lama of the yellow hat sect by the late th century the mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the yellow hat dalai lama after their increasing presence in the amdo region culminating in the conquest of tibet by güshi khan – in

showdown erupted between him and his nephew jianwen after jianwen arrested many of zhu dis associates zhu di plotted a rebellion that sparked a threeyear civil war under the pretext of rescuing the young jianwen from corrupting officials zhu di personally led forces in the revolt the palace in nanjing was burned to the ground along with jianwen himself his wife mother and courtiers zhu di assumed the throne as the yongle emperor – his reign is universally viewed by scholars as a second founding of the ming dynasty since he reversed many of his fathers policies new capital and foreign engagement yongle demoted nanjing to a secondary capital and in  announced the new capital of china was to be at his power base in beijing construction of a new city there lasted from  to  employing hundreds of thousands of workers daily at the center was the political node of the imperial city and at the center of this was the forbidden city the palatial residence of the emperor and his family

the chief eunuch wang zhen encouraged the zhengtong emperor r – to lead a force personally to face the oirats after a recent ming defeat the emperor left the capital and put his halfbrother zhu qiyu in charge of affairs as temporary regent on  september esen routed zhengtongs army and zhengtong was captured – an event known as the tumu crisis the oirats held the zhengtong emperor for ransom however this scheme was foiled once the emperors younger brother assumed the throne under the era name jingtai r – the oirats were also repelled once the jingtai emperors confidant and defense minister yu qian – gained control of the ming armed forces holding the zhengtong emperor in captivity was a useless bargaining chip for the oirats as long as another sat on his throne so they released him back into ming china the former emperor was placed under house arrest in the palace until the coup against the jingtai emperor in  known as the wresting the gate incident the former emperor retook the throne under the new era name tianshun r – tianshun proved to be a troubled time and mongol forces within the ming military structure continued to be problematic on  august  the chinese general cao qin and his ming troops of mongol descent staged a coup against the tianshun emperor out of fear of being next on his purgelist of those who aided him in the wresting the gate incident caos rebel force managed to set fire to the western and eastern gates of the imperial city doused by rain during the battle and killed several leading ministers before his forces were finally cornered and he was forced to commit suicide while the yongle emperor had staged five major offensives north of the great wall against the mongols and the oirats the constant threat of oirat incursions prompted the ming authorities to fortify the great wall from the late th century to the th century nevertheless john fairbank notes that it proved to be a futile military gesture but vividly expressed chinas siege mentality yet the great wall was not meant to be a purely defensive fortification its towers functioned rather as a series of lit beacons and signalling stations to allow rapid warning to friendly units of advancing enemy troops decline and fall of the ming dynasty main article fall of the ming dynasty reign of the wanli emperor the wanli emperor ruled in – in state ceremonial court dress the financial drain of the imjin war in korea against the japanese was one of the many problems – fiscal or other – facing ming china during the reign of the wanli emperor – in the beginning of his reign wanli surrounded himself with able advisors and made a conscientious effort to handle state affairs his grand secretary zhang juzheng – built up an effective network of alliances with senior officials however there was no one after him skilled enough to maintain the stability of these alliances officials soon banded together in opposing political factions over time wanli grew tired of court affairs and frequent political quarreling amongst his ministers preferring to stay behind the walls of the forbidden city and out of his officials sight scholarofficials lost prominence in administration as eunuchs became intermediaries between the aloof emperor and his officials any senior official who wanted to discuss state matters had to persuade powerful eunuchs with a bribe simply to have his

yongle emperors reign and afterwards managed huge imperial workshops commanded armies and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials the eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the ming such as wang zhen wang zhi and liu jin excessive tyrannical eunuch power did not become evident until the s when the wanli emperor increased their rights over the civil bureaucracy and granted them power to collect provincial taxes the eunuch wei

spring morning in a han palace by qiu ying – excessive luxury and decadence marked the late ming period spurred by the enormous state bullion of incoming silver and by private transactions involving silver during the last years of the wanli era and those of his two successors an economic crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empires chief medium of exchange silver the portuguese first established trade with china in  trading japanese silver for chinese silk and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the ming court in  to settle macau as their permanent trade base in china their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the spanish while even the dutch challenged them for control of this trade philip iv of spain reigned – began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from new spain and peru across the pacific through the philippines towards china in favor of shipping americanmined silver through spanish ports in  the new tokugawa regime of japan shut down most of its foreign trade with european powers cutting off another source of silver coming into china these events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces people began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline in the s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver by  that sum could fetch half an ounce and by  only onethird of an ounce for peasants this meant economic disaster since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper famines became common in northern china in the early th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the little ice age famine alongside tax increases widespread military desertions a declining relief system and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and floodcontrol projects caused widespread loss of life and normal

this offer was declined but he was granted honorific ming titles for his gesture recognizing the weakness of ming authority north of their border he united all of the adjacent northern tribes and consolidated power in the region surrounding his homeland as the jurchen jin dynasty had done previously in  he broke relations with the ming court and in  demanded a tribute from them to redress

finally along the northern border of jiangxi province li zicheng died there in the summer of  thus ending the shun dynasty one report says his death was a suicide another states that he was beaten to death by peasants after he was caught stealing their food despite the loss of beijing and the death of the emperor the ming were not yet totally destroyed nanjing fujian guangdong shanxi and yunnan were all strongholds of ming resistance however there were several pretenders for the ming throne and their forces were divided these scattered ming remnants in southern china after  were collectively designated by thcentury historians as the southern ming each bastion of resistance was individually defeated by the qing until  when the last southern ming emperor died the yongli emperor zhu youlang the last ming princes to hold out were the prince of ningjing zhu shugui and the son of zhu yihai the prince of lu zhu honghuan  who stayed with koxingas ming loyalists in the kingdom of tungning until  zhu shugui proclaimed that he acted in the name of the deceased yongli emperor the qing eventually sent the seventeen ming princes still living in taiwan back to mainland china where they spent the rest of their lives in  the qing yongzheng emperor bestowed the hereditary title of marquis on a descendant of the ming dynasty imperial family zhu zhilian  who received a salary from the qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the ming tombs and was also inducted the chinese plain white banner in the eight banners later the qianlong emperor bestowed the title marquis of extended grace posthumously on zhu zhilian in  and the title passed on through twelve generations of ming descendants until the end of the qing dynasty in  the last marquis of extended grance was zhu

the precursors of the modern provinces throughout the song dynasty the largest political division was the circuit lu  however after the jurchen invasion in  the song court established four semiautonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the yuan ming and qing dynasties copied on the yuan model the ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions one civil one military and one for surveillance below the level of the province sheng  were prefectures fu  operating under a prefect zhifu 知 followed by subprefectures zhou  under a subprefect the lowest unit was the county xian  overseen by a magistrate besides the provinces there were also two large areas that belonged to no province but were metropolitan areas jing  attached to nanjing and beijing institutions and bureaus institutional trends the forbidden city the official imperial household of the ming and qing dynasties from  until  when the republic of china evicted puyi from the inner court departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the three departments and six ministries system which was instituted by various dynasties since late han  bce –  ce the ming administration had only one department the secretariat that controlled the six ministries following the execution of the chancellor hu weiyong in  the hongwu emperor abolished the secretariat the censorate and the chief military commission and personally took charge of the six ministries and the regional five military commissions thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers the grand secretariat at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork was instituted but without employing grand counselors or chancellors the hongwu emperor sent his heir apparent to shaanxi in  to tour and soothe xunfu the region in  the yongle emperor commissioned  officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties by  these xunfu assignments became institutionalized as grand coordinators hence the censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors later with censorsinchief by  the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censorinchief or assistant censorinchief and were allowed direct access to the emperor as in prior dynasties the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the censorate censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early ming the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the s by the late ming dynasty there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment grand secretariat and six ministries a portrait of jiang shunfu an official under the hongzhi emperor now in the nanjing museum the decoration of two cranes on his chest is a rank badge that indicates he was a civil official of the first rank governmental institutions in china conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus reflecting its own particular interests the ming administration utilized grand secretaries to assist the emperor handling paperwork under the reign of the yongle emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and grand preceptor a topranking nonfunctional civil service post under the hongxi emperor ruled – the grand secretariat drew its members from the hanlin academy and were considered part of the imperial authority not the ministerial one hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times the secretariat operated as a coordinating agency whereas the six ministries—personnel revenue rites war justice and public works—were direct administrative organs of the state the ministry of personnel was in charge of appointments merit ratings promotions and demotions of officials as well as granting of honorific titles the ministry of revenue was in charge of gathering census data collecting taxes and handling state revenues while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it the ministry of rites was in charge of state ceremonies rituals and sacrifices it also oversaw registers for buddhist and daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states the ministry of war was in charge of the appointments promotions and demotions of military officers the maintenance of military installations equipment and weapons as well as the courier system the ministry of justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes but had no supervisory role over the censorate or the grand court of revision the ministry of public works had charge of government construction projects hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service manufacturing government equipment the maintenance of roads and canals standardization of weights and measures and the gathering of resources from the countryside bureaus and offices for the imperial household ming coinage –th century the imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus female servants were organized into the bureau of palace attendance bureau of ceremonies bureau of apparel bureau of foodstuffs bureau of the bedchamber bureau of handicrafts and office of staff surveillance starting in the s eunuchs began taking over these ladies positions until only the bureau of apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the directorate of palace attendants but as eunuch power at court increased so did their administrative offices with eventual twelve directorates four offices and eight bureaus the dynasty had a vast imperial household staffed with thousands of eunuchs who were headed by the directorate of palace attendants the eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance ceremonial rites food utensils documents stables seals apparel and so on the offices were in charge of providing fuel music paper and baths the bureaus were in charge of weapons silverwork laundering headgear bronzework textile manufacture wineries and gardens at times the most influential eunuch in the directorate of ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies there was a civil service office called the seal office which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals tallies and stamps there were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes personnel scholarofficials candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk by qiu ying – the hongwu emperor from  to  staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only after that the scholarofficials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the sui dynasty – theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials although it was frowned upon for merchants to join in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class however the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials this was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions where education was the most advanced the expansion of the printing industry since song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces for young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary for adult examination candidates there were massproduced inexpensive volumes of confucian classics and successful examination answers as in earlier periods the focus of the examination was classical confucian texts while the bulk of test material centered on the four books outlined by zhu xi in the th century ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the  requirement of completing the eightlegged essay a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends the exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades each grade divided into two degrees with ranging salaries nominally paid in piculs of rice according to their rank while provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to lowranking posts like the county graduates those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi presented scholar degree and assured a highlevel position in  years of ming rule and ninety palace examinations the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was  ebrey states that there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time on the order of one out of  adult males this was in comparison to the  shengyuan government students the lowest tier of graduates by the th century the maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade  and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over  school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years the chief instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a secondgrade county graduate the supervisorate of imperial instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne this office was headed by a grand supervisor of instruction who was ranked as first class of grade three lesser functionaries the xuande emperor playing chuiwan with his eunuchs a game similar to golf by an anonymous court painter of the xuande period – scholarofficials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of nonranked personnel called lesser functionaries they outnumbered officials by four to one charles hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as  throughout the empire these lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank the one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries eunuchs princes and generals detail of the emperors approach showing the wanli emperors royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry full panoramic painting here eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the ming dynasty one of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the eastern depot at the beginning of the dynasty later the western depot this secret service was overseen by the directorate of ceremonial hence this state organs often totalitarian affiliation eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks only theirs had four grades instead of nine descendants of the first ming emperor were made princes and given typically nominal military commands annual stipends and large estates the title used was king  wáng but – unlike the princes in the han and jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories the princes did not serve any administrative function and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors the rebellion of the prince of yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes but once the yongle emperor was enthroned he continued his nephews policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border although princes served no organ of state administration the princes consorts of the imperial princesses and ennobled relatives did staff the imperial clan court which supervised the imperial genealogy like scholarofficials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely meritbased and confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence wu over the cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after  the military even held their own examinations to test military skills in addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the yuan period the ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector in the early half of the dynasty men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them society and culture literature and arts further information ming dynasty painting and ming poetry lofty mount lu by shen zhou  literature painting poetry music and chinese opera of various types flourished during the ming dynasty especially in the economically prosperous lower yangzi valley although short fiction had been popular as far back as the tang dynasty – and the works of contemporaneous authors such as xu guangqi xu xiake and song yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel while the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of classical chinese those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families merchants and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed vernacular chinese literati scholars edited or developed major chinese novels into mature form in this period such as water margin and journey to the west jin ping mei published in  although incorporating earlier material marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology in the later years of the dynasty feng menglong and ling mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction theater scripts were equally imaginative the most famous the peony pavilion was written by tang xianzu – with its first performance at the pavilion of prince teng in  informal essay and travel writing was another highlight xu xiake – a travel literature author published his travel diaries in  written characters with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy the first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in beijing was in  by  the beijing gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing the new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late ming period for the readership of the merchant class poetry of min ding th century in contrast to xu xiake who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature the chinese poet and official yuan hongdao – used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with confucian court politics yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholarofficial this antiofficial sentiment in yuans travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the song dynasty poet and official su shi – yuan hongdao and his two brothers yuan zongdao – and yuan zhongdao – were the founders of the gongan school of letters this highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism which was also apparent in ming vernacular novels such as the jin ping mei yet even gentry and scholarofficials were affected by the new popular romantic literature seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate painting of flowers a butterfly and rock sculpture by chen hongshou – small leaf album paintings like this one first became popular in the song dynasty famous painters included ni zan and dong qichang as well as the four masters of the ming dynasty shen zhou tang yin wen zhengming and qiu ying they drew upon the techniques styles and complexity in painting achieved by their song and yuan predecessors but added techniques and styles wellknown ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art the artist qiu ying was once paid  kg  oz of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were fulltime painters ming dynasty xuande mark and period – imperial blue and white vase metropolitan museum of art new york the period was also renowned for ceramics and porcelainsthe major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at jingdezhen in jiangxi province and dehua in fujian province the dehua porcelain factories catered to european tastes by creating chinese export porcelain by the th century individual potters also became known such as he chaozong who became famous in the early th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture in the ceramic trade in asia chuimei ho estimates that about  of late ming era chinese ceramic exports were sent to europe while the rest were destined for japan and south east asia carved designs in lacquerware and designs glazed onto porcelain wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting these items could be found in the homes of the wealthy alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade ivory and cloisonné the houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework the writing materials in a scholars private study including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal connoisseurship in the late ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions the jesuit matteo ricci while staying in nanjing wrote that chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits however there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur liu tong died  wrote a book printed in  that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art he revealed that a xuande era – bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen porcelain wares from the yongle era – could be judged authentic by their thickness religion see also islam during the ming dynasty jesuit china missions and chinese rites controversy chinese glazed stoneware statue of a daoist deity from the ming dynasty th century the dominant religious beliefs during the ming dynasty were the various forms of chinese folk religion and the three teachings – confucianism taoism and buddhism the yuansupported tibetan lamas fell from favor and the early ming emperors particularly favored taoism granting its practitioners many positions in the states ritual offices the hongwu emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the mongol yuan dynasty and the prolific prince of ning zhu quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking buddhism as a foreign mourning cult deleterious to the state and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the taoist canon islam was also wellestablished throughout china with a history said to have begun with sad ibn abi waqqas during the tang dynasty and strong official support during the yuan although the ming sharply curtailed this support there were still several prominent muslim figures early on including the hongwu emperors generals chang yuqun lan yu ding dexing and mu ying as well as the yongle emperors powerful eunuch zheng he bodhisattva manjusri in blancdechine by he chaozong th century song yingxing devoted an entire section of his book to the ceramics industry in the making of porcelain items like this the advent of the ming was initially devastating to christianity in his first year the hongwu emperor declared the eightyyearold franciscan missions among the yuan heterodox and illegal the centuriesold nestorian church also disappeared during the later ming a new wave of christian missionaries arrived – particularly jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st pauls college on macau after its founding in  the most influential was matteo ricci whose map of the myriad countries of the world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with the convert xu guangqi led to the first chinese translation of euclids elements in  the discovery of a nestorian stele at xian in  also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the nanjing incident of  which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced the others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by the chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de ursis – and a return by the jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the confucian mold restored their fortunes however by the end of the ming the dominicans had begun the chinese rites controversy in rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of christianity under the qing dynasty during his mission ricci was also contacted in beijing by one of the approximately  kaifeng jews and introduced them and their long history in china to europe however the  flood caused by kaifengs ming governor devastated the community which lost five of its twelve families its synagogue and most of its torah philosophy wang yangmings confucianism wang yangming – considered the most influential confucian thinker since zhu xi during the ming dynasty the neoconfucian doctrines of the song scholar zhu xi were embraced by the court and the chinese literati at large although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the yongle emperors extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of fang xiaoru in  the ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming – whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xis concept of the extension of knowledge  or  gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as confucius and mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the classics but not experienced the real world conservative reaction a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to the zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholarbureaucrats were wary of wangs heterodoxy the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer wang yangmings disciple and saltmine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he xinyin  challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests the liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by the censorate and by the donglin academy reestablished in  these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu xiancheng – argued against wangs idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court urban and rural life a ming dynasty red lacquer box with intricate carving of people in the countryside surrounded by a floral border design wang gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the song dynasty – communities in ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city not only was the blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations chinese  since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth emperor minghuangs journey to sichuan a ming dynasty painting after qiu ying – a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a fathers line of work this would include – but was not limited to – coffinmakers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodlemakers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a protobanking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of the huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised the cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in the south the myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more ownercultivators north of the huai river due to harsher climate living not far above

the song dynasty the ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the western world in fact key advances in chinese science in the late ming were spurred by contact with europe in  johann adam schall von bell wrote the first chinese treatise on the telescope the yuanjingshuo far seeing optic glass in  the chongzhen emperor acquired the telescope of the late johann schreck – the heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the catholic missionaries in china but johannes kepler and galileo galileis ideas slowly trickled into china starting with the polish jesuit michael boym – in  adam schall von bells treatise in  and finally joseph edkins alex wylie and john fryer in the th century catholic jesuits in china would promote copernican theory at court yet at the same time embrace the ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until  that catholic missionaries in china sponsored the heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo – and guo shoujing – had laid the basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until  with the efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during the late ming for example the field mill the chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at  ¼ days giving an error of  min and  sec a year or roughly a full day every  years although the ming had adopted guo shoujings shoushi calendar of  which was just as accurate as the gregorian calendar the ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the ming and the statutes of the ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixthgeneration descendant of the hongxi emperor the prince zhu zaiyu – submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in  but the ultraconservative astronomical commission rejected it this was the same zhu zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin – in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in  a year earlier the memorial of xing yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the supervisor of the astronomical bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy xing would later serve with xu guangqi in reforming the calendar chinese  in  according to western standards a point compass chart employed by zheng he during his explorations when the ming founder hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the yuan dynastys palace at khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets selfoperating tiger automata dragonheaded devices that spouted mists of perfume and mechanical clocks in the tradition of yi xing – and su song – – he associated all of them with the decadence of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by the divisional director of the ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that thcentury european clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments  with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese  chinese records – namely the yuan shi chinese  – describe the fivewheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl – which featured the scoop wheel of su songs earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of the time this sanddriven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou shuxue fl – who added a fourth large gear wheel changed gear ratios and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often portrait of matteo ricci by yu wenhui latinized as emmanuel pereira dated the year of riccis death  the chinese were intrigued with european technology but so were visiting europeans of chinese technology in  abraham ortelius – featured in his atlas theatrum orbis terrarum the peculiar chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages just like chinese ships gonzales de mendoza also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on chinese silken robes – while gerardus mercator – featured them in his atlas john milton – in one of his famous poems and andreas everardus van braam houckgeest – in the writings of his travel diary in china the encyclopedist song yingxing – documented a wide array of technologies metallurgic and industrial processes in his tiangong kaiwu chinese  encyclopedia of  this includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a stillhead that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of

– took an interest in irrigation fertilizers famine relief economic and textile crops and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry there were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty but by the mid to late ming the chinese began to frequently employ europeanstyle artillery and firearms the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen sometime before the latters death on  may  with a preface added by jiao in  featured many types of cuttingedge gunpowder weaponry for the time this includes hollow gunpowderfilled exploding cannonballs land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights pins and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses naval mines finmounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile shaped like a dragons head and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels li shizhen – – one of the most renowned pharmacologists and physicians in chinese history – belonged to the late ming period his bencao gangmu is a medical text with  entries each entry with its own name called a gang the mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name inoculation although it can be traced to earlier chinese folk medicine was detailed in chinese texts by the sixteenth century throughout the ming dynasty around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox in regards to oral hygiene the ancient egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end but the chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in  although it used stiff pig hair population appreciating plums by chen hongshou – showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the ming dynasty the historian timothy brook notes that the ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the ming even adult women were underreported for example the daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of  males and  females in  the government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide the practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however the dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding  by  cant likely be explained by infanticide alone the xuande emperor r – he stated in  that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but the population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen – governor of south zhili – in his  report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce the number of people counted in the census of  was  however this number dropped significantly when the government found that some  million people were missing from the tax census of  even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in  the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace the government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of  people in  in his studies on the population of china ho pingti suggests revising the  census to  million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after  ranged between  and  million while the population was in fact increasing even the hongzhi emperor r – remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around  the population of china was perhaps  million people citing heijdra and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using the gazetteers brook estimates that the overall population under the chenghua emperor r – was roughly  million despite midming census figures hovering around  million while prefectures across the empire in the midming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or woodcutters that contributed to deforestation the hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region while the jiajing emperor r – finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with the jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by the late ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since  fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps  million in the late ming dynasty while brook estimates  million and ebrey states perhaps as large as  million however a great epidemic that entered china through the northwest in  ravaged the densely populated areas along the grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that  of the local populace in one

military history naval history this box view talk edit the ming dynasty was the ruling dynasty of china – then known as the empire of the great ming – for  years – following the collapse of the mongolled yuan dynasty the ming described by edwin o reischauer john k fairbank and albert m craig as one of the greatest eras of orderly government and social stability in human history was the last imperial dynasty in china ruled by ethnic han chinese although the primary capital of beijing fell in  to a rebellion led by li zicheng who established the shun dynasty soon replaced by the manchuled qing dynasty regimes loyal to the ming throne – collectively called the southern ming – survived until  the hongwu emperor ruled – attempted to create a society of selfsufficient rural communities ordered in a rigid immobile system that would guarantee and support a permanent class of soldiers for his dynasty the empires standing army exceeded one million troops and the navys dockyards in nanjing were the largest in the world he also took great care breaking the power of the court eunuchs and unrelated magnates enfeoffing his many sons throughout china and attempting to guide these princes through the huang ming zu xun a set of published dynastic instructions this failed spectacularly when his teenage successor the jianwen emperor attempted to curtail his uncles power prompting the jingnan campaign an uprising that placed the prince of yan upon the throne as the yongle emperor in  the yongle emperor established yan as a secondary capital and renamed it beijing constructed the forbidden city and restored the grand canal and the primacy of the imperial examinations in official appointments he rewarded his eunuch supporters and employed them as a counterweight against the confucian scholarbureaucrats one zheng he led seven enormous voyages of exploration into the indian ocean as far as arabia and the eastern coasts of africa the rise of new emperors and new factions diminished such extravagances the capture of the zhengtong emperor during the  tumu crisis ended them completely the imperial navy was allowed to fall into disrepair while forced labor constructed the liaodong palisade and connected and fortified the great wall of china into its modern form wideranging censuses of the entire empire were conducted decennially but the desire to avoid labor and taxes and the difficulty of storing and reviewing the enormous archives at nanjing hampered accurate figures estimates for the lateming population vary from  to  million but necessary revenues were squeezed out of smaller and smaller numbers of farmers as more disappeared from the official records or donated their lands to taxexempt eunuchs or temples haijin laws intended to protect the coasts from japanese pirates instead turned many into smugglers and pirates themselves by the th century however the expansion of european trade – albeit restricted to islands near guangzhou like macau – spread the columbian exchange of crops plants and animals into china introducing chili peppers to sichuan cuisine and highly productive corn and potatoes which diminished famines and spurred population growth the growth of portuguese spanish and dutch trade created new demand for chinese products and produced a massive influx of japanese and american silver this abundance of specie remonetized the ming economy whose paper money had suffered repeated hyperinflation and was no longer trusted while traditional confucians opposed such a prominent role for commerce and the newly rich it created the heterodoxy introduced by wang yangming permitted a more accommodating attitude zhang juzhengs initially successful reforms proved devastating when a slowdown in agriculture produced by the little ice age joined changes in japanese and spanish policy that quickly cut off the supply of silver now necessary for farmers to be able to pay their taxes combined with crop failure floods and epidemic the

emperors of the ming dynasty map of china in ming dynasty founding revolt and rebel rivalry the mongolled yuan dynasty – ruled before the establishment of the ming dynasty explanations for the demise of the yuan include institutionalized ethnic discrimination against han chinese that stirred resentment and rebellion overtaxation of areas hardhit by inflation and massive flooding of the yellow river as a result of the abandonment of irrigation projects consequently agriculture and the economy were in shambles and rebellion broke out among the hundreds of thousands of peasants called upon to work on repairing the dykes of the yellow river a number of han chinese groups revolted including the red turbans in  the red turbans were affiliated with the white lotus a buddhist secret society zhu yuanzhang was a penniless peasant and buddhist monk who joined the red turbans in  he soon gained a reputation after marrying the foster daughter of a rebel commander in  zhus rebel force captured the city of nanjing which he would later establish as the capital of the ming dynasty with the yuan dynasty crumbling competing rebel groups began fighting for control of the country and thus the right to establish a new dynasty in  zhu yuanzhang eliminated his archrival and leader of the rebel han faction chen youliang in the battle of lake poyang arguably the largest naval battle in history known for its ambitious use of fire ships zhus force of  ming sailors were able to defeat a han rebel force over triple their size claimed to be strong the victory destroyed the last opposing rebel faction leaving zhu yuanzhang in uncontested control of the bountiful yangtze river valley and cementing his power in the south after the dynastic head of the red turbans suspiciously died in  while a guest of zhu there was no one left who was remotely capable of contesting his march to the throne and he made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the yuan capital dadu presentday beijing in  the last yuan emperor fled north to the upper capital shangdu and zhu declared the founding of the ming dynasty after razing the yuan palaces in dadu to the ground the city was renamed beiping in the same year zhu yuanzhang took hongwu or vastly martial as his era name reign of the hongwu emperor portrait of the hongwu emperor ruled in – hongwu made an immediate effort to rebuild state infrastructure he built a  km  mi long wall around nanjing as well as new palaces and government halls the history of ming states that as early as  zhu yuanzhang had begun drafting a new confucian law code the da ming lü which was completed by  and repeated certain clauses found in the old tang code of  hongwu organized a military system known as the weisuo which was similar to the fubing system of the tang dynasty – in  hongwu had the chancellor hu weiyong executed upon suspicion of a conspiracy plot to overthrow him after that hongwu abolished the chancellery and assumed this role as chief executive and emperor a precedent mostly followed throughout the ming period with a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects hongwu established the jinyiwei a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard some  people were executed in a series of purges during his rule the hongwu emperor issued many edicts forbidding mongol practices and proclaiming his intention to purify china of barbarian influence however he also sought to use the yuan legacy to legitimize his authority in china and other areas ruled by the yuan he adopted many yuan military practices recruited mongol soldiers and continued to request korean concubines and eunuchs southwestern frontier main article ming conquest of yunnan the old south gate of the ancient city of dali yunnan in qinghai the salar muslims voluntarily came under ming rule their clan leaders capitulating around  uyghur troops under uyghur general hala bashi suppressed the miao rebellions of the s and settled in changde hunan hui muslim troops also settled in changde hunan after serving the ming in campaigns against other aboriginal tribes in  the ming dynasty annexed the areas of the southwest that had once been part of the kingdom of dali following the successful effort by hui muslim ming armies to defeat yuanloyalist mongol and hui muslim troops holding out in yunnan province the hui troops under general mu ying who was appointed governor of yunnan were resettled in the region as part of a colonization effort by the end of the th century some  military colonists settled some  mu  acres of land in what is now yunnan and guizhou roughly half a million more chinese settlers came in later periods these migrations caused a major shift in the ethnic makeup of the region since formerly more than half of the population were nonhan peoples resentment over such massive changes in population and the resulting government presence and policies sparked more miao and yao revolts in  to  which were crushed by an army of  ming troops including  mongols joining the  local guangxi see miao rebellions ming dynasty after the scholar and philosopher wang yangming – suppressed another rebellion in the region he advocated single unitary administration of chinese and indigenous ethnic groups in order to bring about sinification of the local peoples campaign in the northeast main article manchuria under ming rule the great wall of china although the rammed earth walls of the ancient warring states were combined into a unified wall under the qin and han dynasties the vast majority of the brick and stone great wall seen today is a product of the ming dynasty after the overthrow of the mongol yuan dynasty by the ming dynasty in  manchuria remained under control of the mongols of the northern yuan dynasty based in mongolia naghachu a former yuan official and a uriankhai general of the northern yuan dynasty won hegemony over the mongol tribes in manchuria liaoyang province of the former yuan dynasty he grew strong in the northeast with forces large enough numbering hundreds of thousands to threaten invasion of the newly founded ming dynasty in order to restore the mongols to power in china the ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the mongols to attack in  the ming sent a military campaign to attack naghachu which concluded with the surrender of naghachu and ming conquest of manchuria the early ming court could not and did not aspire to the control imposed upon the jurchens in manchuria by the mongols yet it created a norm of organization that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers by the end of the hongwu reign the essentials of a policy toward the jurchens had taken shape most of the inhabitants of manchuria except for the wild jurchens were at peace with china the ming had created many guards  wei in manchuria but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control in  the ming dynasty under yongle emperor established the nurgan regional military commission on the banks of the amur river and yishiha a eunuch of haixi jurchen derivation was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the amur to pacify the wild jurchens after the death of yongle emperor the nurgan regional military commission was abolished in  and the ming court ceased to have substantial activities there although the guards continued to exist in manchuria by the late ming period ming political presence in manchuria had waned considerably relations with tibet main article sinotibetan relations during the ming dynasty a thcentury tibetan thangka of guhyasamaja akshobhyavajra the ming dynasty court gathered various tribute items that were native products of tibet such as thangkas and in return granted gifts to tibetan tributebearers the mingshi – the official history of the ming dynasty compiled by the qing dynasty in  – states that the ming established itinerant

v wylie states that censorship in the mingshi in favor of bolstering the ming emperors prestige and reputation at all costs obfuscates the nuanced history of sinotibetan relations during the ming era modern scholars debate whether the ming dynasty had sovereignty over tibet some believe it was a relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut off when the jiajing emperor r – persecuted buddhism in favor of daoism at court others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship others note the ming need for central asian horses and the need to maintain the teahorse trade the ming sporadically sent armed forays into tibet during the th century which the tibetans successfully resisted several scholars point out that unlike the preceding mongols the ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in tibet the wanli emperor r – attempted to reestablish sinotibetan relations in the wake of a mongoltibetan alliance initiated in  an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent manchu qing dynasty – in their support for the dalai lama of the yellow hat sect by the late th

cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from new spain and peru across the pacific through the philippines towards china in favor of shipping americanmined silver through spanish ports in  the new tokugawa regime of japan shut down most of its foreign trade with european powers cutting off another source of silver coming into china these events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces people began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline in the s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver by  that sum could fetch half an ounce and by  only onethird of an ounce for peasants this meant economic disaster since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper famines became common in northern china in the early th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event now known as the little ice age famine alongside tax increases widespread military desertions a

semiautonomous regional command systems based on territorial and military units with a detached service secretariat that would become the provincial administrations of the yuan ming and qing dynasties copied on the yuan model the ming provincial bureaucracy contained three commissions one civil one military and one for surveillance below the level of the province sheng  were prefectures fu  operating under a prefect zhifu 知 followed by subprefectures zhou  under a subprefect the lowest unit was the county xian  overseen by a magistrate besides the provinces there were also two large areas that belonged to no province but were metropolitan areas jing  attached to nanjing and beijing institutions and bureaus institutional trends the forbidden city the official imperial household of the ming and qing dynasties from  until  when the republic of china evicted puyi from the inner court departing from the main central administrative system generally known as the three departments and six ministries system which was instituted by various dynasties since late han  bce –  ce the ming administration had only one department the secretariat that controlled the six ministries following the execution of the chancellor hu weiyong in  the hongwu emperor abolished the secretariat the censorate and the chief military commission and personally took charge of the six ministries and the regional five military commissions thus a whole level of administration was cut out and only partially rebuilt by subsequent rulers the grand secretariat at the beginning a secretarial institution that assisted the emperor with administrative paperwork was instituted but without employing grand counselors or chancellors the hongwu emperor sent his heir apparent to shaanxi in  to tour and soothe xunfu the region in  the yongle emperor commissioned  officials to travel the empire and uphold similar investigatory and patrimonial duties by  these xunfu assignments became institutionalized as grand coordinators hence the censorate was reinstalled and first staffed with investigating censors later with censorsinchief by  the grand coordinators were granted the title vice censorinchief or assistant censorinchief and were allowed direct access to the emperor as in prior dynasties the provincial administrations were monitored by a travelling inspector from the censorate censors had the power to impeach officials on an irregular basis unlike the senior officials who were to do so only in triennial evaluations of junior officials although decentralization of state power within the provinces occurred in the early ming the trend of central government officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the s by the late ming dynasty there were central government officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment grand secretariat and six ministries a portrait of jiang shunfu an official under the hongzhi emperor now in the nanjing museum the decoration of two cranes on his chest is a rank badge that indicates he was a civil official of the first rank governmental institutions in china conformed to a similar pattern for some two thousand years but each dynasty installed special offices and bureaus reflecting its own particular interests the ming administration utilized grand secretaries to assist the emperor handling paperwork under the reign of the yongle emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies and grand preceptor a topranking nonfunctional civil service post under the hongxi emperor ruled – the grand secretariat drew its members from the hanlin academy and were considered part of the imperial authority not the ministerial one hence being at odds with both the emperor and ministers at times the secretariat operated as a coordinating agency whereas the six ministries—personnel revenue rites war justice and public works—were direct administrative organs of the state the ministry of personnel was in charge of appointments merit ratings promotions and demotions of officials as well as granting of honorific titles the ministry of revenue was in charge of gathering census data collecting taxes and handling state revenues while there were two offices of currency that were subordinate to it the ministry of rites was in charge of state ceremonies rituals and sacrifices it also oversaw registers for buddhist and daoist priesthoods and even the reception of envoys from tributary states the ministry of war was in charge of the appointments promotions and demotions of military officers the maintenance of military installations equipment and weapons as well as the courier system the ministry of justice was in charge of judicial and penal processes but had no supervisory role over the censorate or the grand court of revision the ministry of public works had charge of government construction projects hiring of artisans and laborers for temporary service manufacturing government equipment the maintenance of roads and canals standardization of weights and measures and the gathering of resources from the countryside bureaus and offices for the imperial household ming coinage –th century the imperial household was staffed almost entirely by eunuchs and ladies with their own bureaus female servants were organized into the bureau of palace attendance bureau of ceremonies bureau of apparel bureau of foodstuffs bureau of the bedchamber bureau of handicrafts and office of staff surveillance starting in the s eunuchs began taking over these ladies positions until only the bureau of apparel with its four subsidiary offices remained hongwu had his eunuchs organized into the directorate of palace attendants but as eunuch power at court increased so did their administrative offices with eventual twelve directorates four offices and eight bureaus the dynasty had a vast imperial household staffed with thousands of eunuchs who were headed by the directorate of palace attendants the eunuchs were divided into different directorates in charge of staff surveillance ceremonial rites food utensils documents stables seals apparel and so on the offices were in charge of providing fuel music paper and baths the bureaus were in charge of weapons silverwork laundering headgear bronzework textile manufacture wineries and gardens at times the most influential eunuch in the directorate of ceremonial acted as a de facto dictator over the state although the imperial household was staffed mostly by eunuchs and palace ladies there was a civil service office called the seal office which cooperated with eunuch agencies in maintaining imperial seals tallies and stamps there were also civil service offices to oversee the affairs of imperial princes personnel scholarofficials candidates who had taken the civil service examinations would crowd around the wall where the results were posted detail from a handscroll in ink and color on silk by qiu ying – the hongwu emperor from  to  staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only after that the scholarofficials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the sui dynasty – theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials although it was frowned upon for merchants to join in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class however the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials this was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions where education was the most advanced the expansion of the printing industry since song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces for young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary for adult examination candidates there were massproduced inexpensive volumes of confucian classics and successful examination answers as in earlier periods the focus of the examination was classical confucian texts while the bulk of test material centered on the four books outlined by zhu xi in the th century ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the  requirement of completing the eightlegged essay a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends the exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades each grade divided into two degrees with ranging salaries nominally paid in piculs of rice according to their rank while provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to lowranking posts like the county graduates those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi presented scholar degree and assured a highlevel position in  years of ming rule and ninety palace examinations the number of doctoral degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was  ebrey states that there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time on the order of one out of  adult males this was in comparison to the  shengyuan government students the lowest tier of graduates by the th century the maximum tenure in office was nine years but every three years officials were graded on their performance by senior officials if they were graded as superior then they were promoted if graded adequate then they retained their ranks and if graded inadequate they were demoted one rank in extreme cases officials would be dismissed or punished only capital officials of grade  and above were exempt from the scrutiny of recorded evaluation although they were expected to confess any of their faults there were over  school instructors in county and prefectural schools who were subject to evaluations every nine years the chief instructor on the prefectural level was classified as equal to a secondgrade county graduate the supervisorate of imperial instruction oversaw the education of the heir apparent to the throne this office was headed by a grand supervisor of instruction who was ranked as first class of grade three lesser functionaries the xuande emperor playing chuiwan with his eunuchs a game similar to golf by an anonymous court painter of the xuande period – scholarofficials who entered civil service through examinations acted as executive officials to a much larger body of nonranked personnel called lesser functionaries they outnumbered officials by four to one charles hucker estimates that they were perhaps as many as  throughout the empire these lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies yet they should not be confused with lowly lictors runners and bearers lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank the one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the good service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries eunuchs princes and generals detail of the emperors approach showing the wanli emperors royal carriage being pulled by elephants and escorted by cavalry full panoramic painting here eunuchs gained unprecedented power over state affairs during the ming dynasty one of the most effective means of control was the secret service stationed in what was called the eastern depot at the beginning of the dynasty later the western depot this secret service was overseen by the directorate of ceremonial hence this state organs often totalitarian affiliation eunuchs had ranks that were equivalent to civil service ranks only theirs had four grades instead of nine descendants of the first ming emperor were made princes and given typically nominal military commands annual stipends and large estates the title used was king  wáng but – unlike the princes in the han and jin dynasties – these estates were not feudatories the princes did not serve any administrative function and they partook in military affairs only during the reigns of the first two emperors the rebellion of the prince of yan was justified in part as upholding the rights of the princes but once the yongle emperor was enthroned he continued his nephews policy of disarming his brothers and moved their fiefs away from the militarized northern border although princes served no organ of state administration the princes consorts of the imperial princesses and ennobled relatives did staff the imperial clan court which supervised the imperial genealogy like scholarofficials military generals were ranked in a hierarchic grading system and were given merit evaluations every five years as opposed to three years for officials however military officers had less prestige than officials this was due to their hereditary service instead of solely meritbased and confucian values that dictated those who chose the profession of violence wu over the cultured pursuits of knowledge wen although seen as less prestigious military officers were not excluded from taking civil service examinations and after  the military even held their own examinations to test military skills in addition to taking over the established bureaucratic structure from the yuan period the ming emperors established the new post of the travelling military inspector in the early half of the dynasty men of noble lineage dominated the higher ranks of military office this trend was reversed during the latter half of the dynasty as men from more humble origins eventually displaced them society and culture literature and arts further information ming dynasty painting and ming poetry lofty mount lu by shen zhou  literature painting poetry music and chinese opera of various types flourished during the ming dynasty especially in the economically prosperous lower yangzi valley although short fiction had been popular as far back as the tang dynasty – and the works of contemporaneous authors such as xu guangqi xu xiake and song yingxing were often technical and encyclopedic the most striking literary development was the vernacular novel while the gentry elite were educated enough to fully comprehend the language of classical chinese those with rudimentary education – such as women in educated families merchants and shop clerks – became a large potential audience for literature and performing arts that employed vernacular chinese literati scholars edited or developed major chinese novels into mature form in this period such as water margin and journey to the west jin ping mei published in  although incorporating earlier material marks the trend toward independent composition and concern with psychology in the later years of the dynasty feng menglong and ling mengchu innovated with vernacular short fiction theater scripts were equally imaginative the most famous the peony pavilion was written by tang xianzu – with its first performance at the pavilion of prince teng in  informal essay and travel writing was another highlight xu xiake – a travel literature author published his travel diaries in  written characters with information on everything from local geography to mineralogy the first reference to the publishing of private newspapers in beijing was in  by  the beijing gazette switched from using woodblock print to movable type printing the new literary field of the moral guide to business ethics was developed during the late ming period for the readership of the merchant class poetry of min ding th century in contrast to xu xiake who focused on technical aspects in his travel literature the chinese poet and official yuan hongdao – used travel literature to express his desires for individualism as well as autonomy from and frustration with confucian court politics yuan desired to free himself from the ethical compromises that were inseparable from the career of a scholarofficial this antiofficial sentiment in yuans travel literature and poetry was actually following in the tradition of the song dynasty poet and official su shi – yuan hongdao and his two brothers yuan zongdao – and yuan zhongdao – were the founders of the gongan school of letters this highly individualistic school of poetry and prose was criticized by the confucian establishment for its association with intense sensual lyricism which was also apparent in ming vernacular novels such as the jin ping mei yet even gentry and scholarofficials were affected by the new popular romantic literature seeking courtesans as soulmates to reenact the heroic love stories that arranged marriages often could not provide or accommodate painting of flowers a butterfly and rock sculpture by chen hongshou – small leaf album paintings like this one first became popular in the song dynasty famous painters included ni zan and dong qichang as well as the four masters of the ming dynasty shen zhou tang yin wen zhengming and qiu ying they drew upon the techniques styles and complexity in painting achieved by their song and yuan predecessors but added techniques and styles wellknown ming artists could make a living simply by painting due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art the artist qiu ying was once paid  kg  oz of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were fulltime painters ming dynasty xuande mark and period – imperial blue and white vase metropolitan museum of art new york the period was also renowned for ceramics and porcelainsthe major production centers for porcelain were the imperial kilns at jingdezhen in jiangxi province and dehua in fujian province the dehua porcelain factories catered to european tastes by creating chinese export porcelain by the th century individual potters also became known such as he chaozong who became famous in the early th century for his style of white porcelain sculpture in the ceramic trade in asia chuimei ho estimates that about  of late ming era chinese ceramic exports were sent to europe while the rest were destined for japan and south east asia carved designs in lacquerware and designs glazed onto porcelain wares displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity to those in painting these items could be found in the homes of the wealthy alongside embroidered silks and wares in jade ivory and cloisonné the houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework the writing materials in a scholars private study including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal connoisseurship in the late ming period centered on these items of refined artistic taste which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions the jesuit matteo ricci while staying in nanjing wrote that chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits however there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur liu tong died  wrote a book printed in  that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art he revealed that a xuande era – bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen porcelain wares from the yongle era – could be judged authentic by their thickness religion see also islam during the ming dynasty jesuit china missions and chinese rites controversy chinese glazed stoneware statue of a daoist deity from the ming dynasty th century the dominant religious beliefs during the ming dynasty were the various forms of chinese folk religion and the three teachings – confucianism taoism and buddhism the yuansupported tibetan lamas fell from favor and the early ming emperors particularly favored taoism granting its practitioners many positions in the states ritual offices the hongwu emperor curtailed the cosmopolitan culture of the mongol yuan dynasty and the prolific prince of ning zhu quan even composed one encyclopedia attacking buddhism as a foreign mourning cult deleterious to the state and another encyclopedia that subsequently joined the taoist canon islam was also wellestablished throughout china with a history said to have begun with sad ibn abi waqqas during the tang dynasty and strong official support during the yuan although the ming sharply curtailed this support there were still several prominent muslim figures early on including the hongwu emperors generals chang yuqun lan yu ding dexing and mu ying as well as the yongle emperors powerful eunuch zheng he bodhisattva manjusri in blancdechine by he chaozong th century song yingxing devoted an entire section of his book to the ceramics industry in the making of porcelain items like this the advent of the ming was initially devastating to christianity in his first year the hongwu emperor declared the eightyyearold franciscan missions among the yuan heterodox and illegal the centuriesold nestorian church also disappeared during the later ming a new wave of christian missionaries arrived – particularly jesuits – who employed new western science and technology in their arguments for conversion they were educated in chinese language and culture at st pauls college on macau after its founding in  the most influential was matteo ricci whose map of the myriad countries of the world upended traditional geography throughout east asia and whose work with the convert xu guangqi led to the first chinese translation of euclids elements in  the discovery of a nestorian stele at xian in  also permitted christianity to be treated as an old and established faith rather than as a new and dangerous cult however there were strong disagreements about the extent to which converts could continue to perform rituals to the emperor confucius or their ancestors ricci had been very accommodating and an attempt by his successors to backtrack from this policy led to the nanjing incident of  which exiled four jesuits to macau and forced the others out of public life for six years a series of spectacular failures by the chinese astronomers – including missing an eclipse easily computed by xu guangqi and sabatino de ursis – and a return by the jesuits to presenting themselves as educated scholars in the confucian mold restored their fortunes however by the end of the ming the dominicans had begun the chinese rites controversy in rome that would eventually lead to a full ban of christianity under the qing dynasty during his mission ricci was also contacted in beijing by one of the approximately  kaifeng jews and introduced them and their long history in china to europe however the  flood caused by kaifengs ming governor devastated the community which lost five of its twelve families its synagogue and most of its torah philosophy wang yangmings confucianism wang yangming – considered the most influential confucian thinker since zhu xi during the ming dynasty the neoconfucian doctrines of the song scholar zhu xi were embraced by the court and the chinese literati at large although the direct line of his school was destroyed by the yongle emperors extermination of the ten degrees of kinship of fang xiaoru in  the ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations however was wang yangming – whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to chan buddhism building upon zhu xis concept of the extension of knowledge  or  gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone therefore he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as confucius and mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined a peasant with a great deal of experience and intelligence would then be wiser than an official who had memorized the classics but not experienced the real world conservative reaction a ming dynasty print drawing of confucius on his way to the zhou dynasty capital of luoyang other scholarbureaucrats were wary of wangs heterodoxy the increasing number of his disciples while he was still in office and his overall socially rebellious message to curb his influence he was often sent out to deal with military affairs and rebellions far away from the capital yet his ideas penetrated mainstream chinese thought and spurred new interest in taoism and buddhism furthermore people began to question the validity of the social hierarchy and the idea that the scholar should be above the farmer wang yangmings disciple and saltmine worker wang gen gave lectures to commoners about pursuing education to improve their lives while his follower he xinyin  challenged the elevation and emphasis of the family in chinese society his contemporary li zhi even taught that women were the intellectual equals of men and should be given a better education both li and he eventually died in prison jailed on charges of spreading dangerous ideas yet these dangerous ideas of educating women had long been embraced by some mothers and by courtesans who were as literate and skillful in calligraphy painting and poetry as their male guests the liberal views of wang yangming were opposed by the censorate and by the donglin academy reestablished in  these conservatives wanted a revival of orthodox confucian ethics conservatives such as gu xiancheng – argued against wangs idea of innate moral knowledge stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain these two strands of confucian thought hardened by chinese scholars notions of obligation towards their mentors developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state who used any opportunity to impeach members of the other faction from court urban and rural life a ming dynasty red lacquer box with intricate carving of people in the countryside surrounded by a floral border design wang gen was able to give philosophical lectures to many commoners from different regions because – following the trend already apparent in the song dynasty – communities in ming society were becoming less isolated as the distance between market towns was shrinking schools descent groups religious associations and other local voluntary organizations were increasing in number and allowing more contact between educated men and local villagers jonathan spence writes that the distinction between what was town and country was blurred in ming china since suburban areas with farms were located just outside and in some cases within the walls of a city not only was the blurring of town and country evident but also of socioeconomic class in the traditional four occupations chinese  since artisans sometimes worked on farms in peak periods and farmers often traveled into the city to find work during times of dearth emperor minghuangs journey to sichuan a ming dynasty painting after qiu ying – a variety of occupations could be chosen or inherited from a fathers line of work this would include – but was not limited to – coffinmakers ironworkers and blacksmiths tailors cooks and noodlemakers retail merchants tavern teahouse or winehouse managers shoemakers seal cutters pawnshop owners brothel heads and merchant bankers engaging in a protobanking system involving notes of exchange virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices specialized luxury goods headgear fine cloth teas and others smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers a small township also provided a place for simple schooling news and gossip matchmaking religious festivals traveling theater groups tax collection and bases of famine relief distribution farming villagers in the north spent their days harvesting crops like wheat and millet while farmers south of the huai river engaged in intensive rice cultivation and had lakes and ponds where ducks and fish could be raised the cultivation of mulberry trees for silkworms and tea bushes could be found mostly south of the yangzi river even further south sugarcane and citrus were grown as basic crops some people in the mountainous southwest made a living by selling lumber from hard bamboo besides cutting down trees to sell wood the poor also made a living by turning wood into charcoal and by burning oyster shells to make lime and fired pots and weaving mats and baskets in the north traveling by horse and carriage was most common while in the south the myriad of rivers canals and lakes provided cheap and easy water transport although the south had the characteristic of the wealthy landlord and tenant farmers there were on average many more ownercultivators north of the huai river due to harsher climate living not far above

ceylon at the upper right and east africa along the bottom sailing directions and distances are marked using zhenlu chinese 針 or compass route compared to the flourishing of science and technology in the song dynasty the ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the western world in fact key advances in chinese science in the late ming were spurred by contact with europe in  johann adam schall von bell wrote the first chinese treatise on the telescope the yuanjingshuo far seeing optic glass in  the chongzhen emperor acquired the telescope of the late johann schreck – the heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the catholic missionaries in china but johannes kepler and galileo galileis ideas slowly trickled into china starting with the polish jesuit michael boym – in  adam schall von bells treatise in  and finally joseph edkins alex wylie and john fryer in the th century catholic jesuits in china would promote copernican theory at court yet at the same time embrace the ptolemaic system in their writing it was not until  that catholic missionaries in china sponsored the heliocentric model as their protestant peers did although shen kuo – and guo shoujing – had laid the basis for trigonometry in china another important work in chinese trigonometry would not be published again until  with the efforts of xu guangqi and matteo ricci ironically some inventions which had their origins in ancient china were reintroduced to china from europe during the late ming for example the field mill the chinese calendar was in need of reform since it inadequately measured the solar year at  ¼ days giving an error of  min and  sec a year or roughly a full day every  years although the ming had adopted guo shoujings shoushi calendar of  which was just as accurate as the gregorian calendar the ming directorate of astronomy failed to periodically readjust it this was perhaps due to their lack of expertise since their offices had become hereditary in the ming and the statutes of the ming prohibited private involvement in astronomy a sixthgeneration descendant of the hongxi emperor the prince zhu zaiyu – submitted a proposal to fix the calendar in  but the ultraconservative astronomical commission rejected it this was the same zhu zaiyu who discovered the system of tuning known as equal temperament a discovery made simultaneously by simon stevin – in europe in addition to publishing his works on music he was able to publish his findings on the calendar in  a year earlier the memorial of xing yunlu suggesting a calendar improvement was rejected by the supervisor of the astronomical bureau due to the law banning private practice of astronomy xing would later serve with xu guangqi in reforming the calendar chinese  in  according to western standards a point compass chart employed by zheng he during his explorations when the ming founder hongwu came upon the mechanical devices housed in the yuan dynastys palace at khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets selfoperating tiger automata dragonheaded devices that spouted mists of perfume and mechanical clocks in the tradition of yi xing – and su song – – he associated all of them with the decadence of mongol rule and had them destroyed this was described in full length by the divisional director of the ministry of works xiao xun who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the yuan dynasty palace later european jesuits such as matteo ricci and nicolas trigault would briefly mention indigenous chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels however both ricci and trigault were quick to point out that thcentury european clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in china which they listed as water clocks incense clocks and other instruments  with wheels rotated by sand as if by water chinese  chinese records – namely the yuan shi chinese  – describe the fivewheeled sand clock a mechanism pioneered by zhan xiyuan fl – which featured the scoop wheel of su songs earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated similar to european models of the time this sanddriven wheel clock was improved upon by zhou shuxue fl – who added a fourth large gear wheel changed gear ratios and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often portrait of matteo ricci by yu wenhui latinized as emmanuel pereira dated the year of riccis death  the chinese were intrigued with european technology but so were visiting europeans of chinese technology in  abraham ortelius – featured in his atlas theatrum orbis terrarum the peculiar chinese innovation of mounting masts and sails onto carriages just like chinese ships gonzales de mendoza also mentioned this a year later – noting even the designs of them on chinese silken robes – while gerardus mercator – featured them in his atlas john milton – in one of his famous poems and andreas everardus van braam houckgeest – in the writings of his travel diary in china the encyclopedist song yingxing – documented a wide array of technologies metallurgic and industrial processes in his tiangong kaiwu chinese  encyclopedia of  this includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers the annual processes of sericulture and weaving with the loom metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a stillhead that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a ripcord and steel flint wheel a cannon from the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen before the latters death in  focusing on agriculture in his nongzheng quanshu the agronomist xu guangqi – took an interest in irrigation fertilizers famine relief economic and textile crops and empirical observation of the elements that gave insight into early understandings of chemistry there were many advances and new designs in gunpowder weapons during the beginning of the dynasty but by the mid to late ming the chinese began to frequently employ europeanstyle artillery and firearms the huolongjing compiled by jiao yu and liu bowen sometime before the latters death on  may  with a preface added by jiao in  featured many types of cuttingedge gunpowder weaponry for the time this includes hollow gunpowderfilled exploding cannonballs land mines that used a complex trigger mechanism of falling weights pins and a steel wheellock to ignite the train of fuses naval mines finmounted winged rockets for aerodynamic control multistage rockets propelled by booster rockets before igniting a swarm of smaller rockets issuing forth from the end of the missile shaped like a dragons head and hand cannons that had up to ten barrels li shizhen – – one of the most renowned pharmacologists and physicians in chinese history – belonged to the late ming period his bencao gangmu is a medical text with  entries each entry with its own name called a gang the mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name inoculation although it can be traced to earlier chinese folk medicine was detailed in chinese texts by the sixteenth century throughout the ming dynasty around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox in regards to oral hygiene the ancient egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end but the chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle toothbrush in  although it used stiff pig hair population appreciating plums by chen hongshou – showing a lady holding an oval fan while enjoying the beauty of the plum sinologist historians debate the population figures for each era in the ming dynasty the historian timothy brook notes that the ming government census figures are dubious since fiscal obligations prompted many families to underreport the number of people in their households and many county officials to underreport the number of households in their jurisdiction children were often underreported especially female children as shown by skewed population statistics throughout the ming even adult women were underreported for example the daming prefecture in north zhili reported a population of  males and  females in  the government attempted to revise the census figures using estimates of the expected average number of people in each household but this did not solve the widespread problem of tax registration some part of the gender imbalance may be attributed to the practice of female infanticide the practice is well documented in china going back over two thousand years and it was described as rampant and practiced by almost every family by contemporary authors however the dramatically skewed sex ratios which many counties reported exceeding  by  cant likely be explained by infanticide alone the xuande emperor r – he stated in  that his populace was dwindling due to palace construction and military adventures but the population was rising under him a fact noted by zhou chen – governor of south zhili – in his  report to the throne about widespread itinerant commerce the number of people counted in the census of  was  however this number dropped significantly when the government found that some  million people were missing from the tax census of  even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in  the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region where hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace the government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of  people in  in his studies on the population of china ho pingti suggests revising the  census to  million people noting that large areas of north china and frontier areas were not counted in that census brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after  ranged between  and  million while the population was in fact increasing even the hongzhi emperor r – remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers william atwell states that around  the population of china was perhaps  million people citing heijdra and mote historians are now turning to local gazetteers of ming china for clues that would show consistent growth in population using the gazetteers brook estimates that the overall population under the chenghua emperor r – was roughly  million despite midming census figures hovering around  million while prefectures across the empire in the midming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till so that many would become drifters conmen or woodcutters that contributed to deforestation the hongzhi and zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region while the jiajing emperor r – finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in order to bring in more revenues even with the jiajing reforms to document migrant workers and merchants by the late ming era the government census still did not accurately reflect the enormous growth in population gazetteers across the empire noted this and made their own estimations of the overall population in the ming some guessing that it had doubled tripled or even grown fivefold since  fairbank estimates that the population was perhaps  million in the late ming dynasty while brook estimates  million and ebrey states perhaps as large as  million however a great epidemic that entered china through the northwest in  ravaged the densely populated areas along the grand canal a gazetteer in northern zhejiang noted more than half the population fell ill that year and that  of the local populace in one area was dead by  see also list of emperors of the ming dynasty ming emperors family tree economy of the ming dynasty taxation in premodern china ye chunji for further information on rural economics
