summary of individual  legacies of british slaveownership legacies of british slaveownership ucl charles mcgarel profile  legacies summary    claimant or beneficiary biography slaveowner in british guiana patron of a british conservative political dynasty and philanthropist who shaped larne in northern ireland his entry in the odnb as merchant and slaveowner was published in  charles mcgarel has not been a wellknown figure does not appear in the largescale studies of city of london and did not himself leave a physical imprint on london but he did leave intangible legacies within it and physical ones and intangible ones beyond it london appears to have performed a limited function for him as the locus of wealthaccumulation and having made his money he chose to leave his mark elsewhere at the same time inevitably his legacies also appear indirectly in london the city of his activity as merchant and financier as well as one of his two homes for  years charles mcgarel was born around  in larne in northern ireland the son of a local innkeeper or cobbler as a young man he went with at least two of his brothers to what was then demerara on the coast of south america at a time when british capital and british emigrants were penetrating the dutch possessions of demerara berbice and essequibo now guyanapreviously british guiana their colonial name after  until  these dutch possessions were captured in  and again in  they formally became british colonies only in  this was a sugar frontier highly expansive and highly profitable hungry for new slaves despite the ban on the african slave trade in  to which the three colonies were subject one reason for that hunger for new slaves was the very high rate of mortality of the enslaved in the new sugar territories for a number of years enslaved people to fill the gaps were brought from other british colonies in the caribbean under license although these movements were increasingly restricted from  onwards mcgarel or possibly one of his brothers appears by  to have become a partner in the local merchant firm of johnson dyett mcgarel and co of stabroek known as georgetown after  when it is shown importing supplies and consumer goods from britain for sale to local residents the essequebo and demerary royal gazette shows mcgarel there still in the  period in  for example he became treasurer of the committee for quarterly balls and in  he and his brother peter are recorded acting as attorneys for an absentee slaveowner thomas naghten   by  mcgarel had moved to london his firm of hall mcgarel first appears in the trade directories in that year at  austin friars it later moved at the time of the compensation process in the mids to  fenchurch street hall mcgarel had evolved from a firm at the same austin friars address named underwood hall  co which in turn had evolved from an earlier firm called underwood dyett the founders of underwood dyett appear to have been men whom mcgarel knew or with whom he was connected in british guiana dyett had been a local partner of mcgarel in demerara the hall partners were in the firm were alexander and david hall the london gazette shows in  the dissolution of hall mcgarel with the departure of alexander hall and its continuation by two of the three previous partners david hall and charles mcgarel david hall was originally from barbados married there in  retained his ownership of slaves there but at some point shortly after his marriage came to london his wife died here in  and joined the underwood dyett firm as a partner presumably alexander was either david’s brother or his father hall mcgarel and its predecessor firms were west indian merchants focused on british guiana the firm apparently acted as london agent for estates in british guiana it appears for example in the boulton  watt papers in the s just as underwood dyett and underwood hall had in the s the firm also extended credit to slaveowners in the colony for example entering into a mortgage of £ on the reliance estate in essequibo in march  mcgarel alexander hall and david hall were among the  absentee slaveowners and mortgagees petitioning the privy council in  against compulsory manumission in demerara and berbice  mcgarel served on the committee of five appointed to pursue the appeal which was heard in july  and appears to have stalemated the british government’s efforts to enforce compulsory manumission     in the s the partners in hall mcgarel were some of the major beneficiaries of slave compensation they were the mortgagees on the endragt and mon repos estates and the  enslaved people upon them and received £ s d in december  again as mortgagees they received £ s d for  enslaved on philadelphia estate charles mcgarel and david hall the two partners owned together with alexander hall the hamburg estate on tiger island with  enslaved and received £ s d in compensation for those people in january  and they had a smaller award for £ s d for  enslaved at cumings lodge charles mcgarel personally ie outside the framework of the hall mcgarel firm with his brothers owned the uniform estate and the  enslaved on it for which he and john and peter mcgarel were awarded £ s d in january  in addition charles mcgarel was the sole awardee of £ s d for  slaves on nouvelle flandres and had two additional small awards in his own name mcgarel also appears as a coawardee of three big claims for  enslaved totalling £ but here we believe he was acting as executor for one of the former owners thomas naghten for whom mcgarel acted as attorney when he mcgarel was in demerara in the early s and who reappears in this narrative below rather than as beneficiary peter and john mcgarel also were awarded almost £ for the enslaved on the bank hall estate in british guiana david hall also collected compensation in his own name about £ for enslaved people in barbados on his estate locust hall and he appears in an unknown capacity with john fullarton as coawardees on a large claim for  slaves on the ma retraite estate in british guiana so in total the partners received almost £ omitting the £ where mcgarel was executor a huge amount in the context of the day there were at least two additional cases of ‘mercantile interception’ where hall and mcgarel counterclaimed as mortgagees on the reliance estate of donald mackay although the award of £ s d for  slaves is shown in mackay’s name and on the richmond hill estate of laurence fitzgerald where again the award of £ s d was made in fitzgerald’s name in both cases the compensation was probably shared with hall mcgarel the firm of hall mcgarel was dissolved on st january  a few years after the compensation process  when its partners were shown as david hall charles mcgarel and alexander hall hall the latter being the son of david hall david hall lived at  portland place in the late s although he died in  at  park street he had also bought in  the botleys park estate in surrey which he later sold to another slaveowner john beckles hyndman   david hall left £ in personalty ie not including the value of any real property ie land a fortune that made him one of the richest people dying in britain that year his son alexander hall hall who had been educated at eton and balliol appears to have dropped from commerce after his father’s retirement in  and was appointed as deputylieutenant of sussex in  he died at watergate house near emsworth hampshire in  having made the transition from his father’s slaveowning to english landed gentleman and county society charles mcgarel himself does not appear again as a merchant after the  po directory but he continued as an absentee owner of estates in british guiana in  he is shown as the owner of two estates blenheim and caledonia blenheim had belonged to an absentee slaveowner called tully higgins one of whose executors was mcgarel’s former partner alexander hall mcgarel lived at  wimpole street from at least  to  but then moved to the more plutocratic  belgrave square in the late s and that remained his london home until his death in the s he was active in a number of diverse financial areas of the city after the early s for example he became chairman of the committee of mexican bondholders in one of the periodic upheavals in international bond markets in the mids he was also a director of the colonial bank he invested in industry this is a classic confirmation of williams’ thesis that profits from slavery not just the slavetrade fed britain’s industrial revolution mcgarel was one of the major investors in the maesteg iron industry alongside a fellow slaveowner and west india merchant james cavan subscribing £ to the llynvi iron company in  and increasing the investment to £ in its restructuring as the llynvi vale iron co in  mcgarel also subscribed in the railway boom £ to the london  brighton railway in  and much larger amounts in the mids £ to the london chatham and north kent line and £ to the edinburgh  northern in  and a further £ to the north kent and £ to the british  irish union in  as an aside his brother peter was also a railway investor subscribing £ to the belfast  ballymena line in  charles mcgarel flirted with a political career being put forward by the conservatives for worcester in the may  byelection but ‘as he was not explicit on the subject of “protection” he found so little favour with the voters that after fours days’ canvassing he left the city’ he died a very wealthy man in  leaving personalty of £ making him in turn one of the richest men in britain dying that year the impact of this slaveowner might therefore appear predictable if a little diffuse his wealth clearly was made from slavery and equally clearly it flowed into and helped the development of the city as a financial centre in the th century incontrovertibly his slavewealth including compensation became capital in the transformation of manufacturing and transportation in britain there can be legitimate debate about how important were mcgarel and his fellowslaveowners in aggregate to th century business and the british economy but the individual impacts are or can be made visible as with mcgarel and can slowly be pieced together but there are legacies well beyond the commercial and industrial and for mcgarel there are three other things we want to bring forward to illustrate both the extent and limitations of the legacies of slaveownership first is his impact in larne which was his home town with his wealth mcgarel bought land and an estate at magheramorne near larne in  beginning perhaps to make a transition from fulltime merchant to more passive financier and rentier he clearly spent time there away from london the philanthropist and antislavery activist samuel gurney for example met mcgarel by chance there on gurney’s celebrated tour of postfamine ireland in autumn  and rekindled an old acquaintance the two men shared an interest in the national schools system which mcgarel funded in larne and mcgarel endowed buildings in larne the town hall is known as the mcgarel town hall funded by mcgarel and built in  there is a mcgarel cemetery on land he donated in  and there are mcgarel almshouses built in    in  a plaque was installed commemorating him as a benefactor it is understood in larne that his wealth derived from demerara and the sugar trade but as is often the case the role of slavery is not visible in the shorthand histories of his wealth deployed locally so firstly his legacy is in larne’s physical fabric secondly there is the impact of his transmission of his slavewealth on his death his legacy in the literal sense   in april  charles mcgarel had married he was then well over  his wife was mary rosina hogg the daughter of sir james weir hogg mp and chairman of the east india co and the sister of among others james macnaughten hogg the mp and chief of the metropolitan board of works in london between  and progenitor of the blackwall tunnel the mcgarels had no children and on his death mcgarel left his estate at magheramorne to his brotherinlaw the mp on condition that the latter changed his name to james mcgarel hogg which of course hogg did   one of the first things he did with his inheritance was to build a new house between  and  magheramorne house mcgarel hogg who was himself married to the daughter of st baron penrhyn another slaveowning family in jamaica this time later became st baron magheramorne however the nd baron married the daughter of the earl of shaftesbury squandered the family fortune and died bankrupt around  the title itself continued for a few more decades but the money was gone the financial legacy of slavery can therefore sometimes be ephemeral but mcgarel also had a second brotherinlaw whose life and career he substantially shaped quintin hogg hogg was a generation younger than mcgarel having left eton in  and gone into the city for an unhappy  month spell with a firm of teamerchants mcgarel engineered the entry of hogg into the firm of bosanquet naghten mcgarel was not a name partner of bosanquet naghten or the firms that evolved from it but it seems to be the successor firm of hall mcgarel appearing at the same address at  fenchurch street from the  po directory onwards its partners were the east indian man augustus henry bosanquet and his son percival both intermarried with the bevan banking family and thomas naghten whom we believe to have been the thomas naghten who was mcgarel’s attorney in british guiana in  and was himself the son of the former absentee british guiana slaveowner for whom charles mcgarel and his brother peter had acted as attorney in the early s it is clear from ellen hogg’s biography of quintin hogg that mcgarel was the eminence grise of the firm what today would probably be called a shadow director she states that mcgarel found hogg a place in ‘his firm’ how much if any of his capital he left in is unclear walter rodney guyanese sugar plantations closely links mgarel and hogg eg footnote  page  sale of devonshire castle by mcgarel  hogg page  mr hogg acting for the late mr mcgarel and mr campbell in amalgamating estates into reliance footnote  page  charles mcgarel of curtis  campbell but with the platform of mcgarel’s sponsorship and of his commercial networks hogg rose rapidly hogg stayed with this firm for the rest of the century he retired in  as it transformed itself into bosanquet curtis and then hogg curtis campbell one of the leading firms in the london sugar market with continuous involvement in the demerara sugar industry as well as acquiring through defaults estates in jamaica and ceylon the firm remained independent until  when it merged with booker mcconnell later in life hogg refounded and moulded the regent street polytechnic now the university of westminster his son was douglas mcgarel hogg  st viscount hailsham lord chancellor in the late s and again in the later s and secretary of state for war in the early s quintin hogg’s grandson also quintin hogg lord hailsham was a tory politician and the lord chancellor in ted heath’s and margaret thatcher’s governments between  and  lord hailsham’s full name was quintin mcgarel hogg lord hailsham’s son in turn was douglas hogg the former mp and agriculture minister mcgarel’s sponsorship of quntin hogg led to the foundation of a tory dynasty that until this generation actually carried mcgarel’s name sources nicholas draper ‘mcgarel charles –’ oxford dictionary of national

application claims priority to us provisional application ser no  filed jan   the content of us provisional application ser no  is hereby incorporated by reference in its entiretybackground of the inventionthe presently described technology generally relates to the selection and weighting of securities for investment portfolios and more specifically to methods for selecting and weighting stocks for actively managed exchangetraded fundsconventional mutual funds and exchangetraded fundsas compared to individual securities mutual funds such as stock funds that include many holdings have the advantage of providing the fund owner with diversification of assets which tends to lessen volatility and the risk of a large loss however conventional mutual funds do not offer intraday liquidity like individual securities and cannot be actively bought and sold on an exchange throughout the course of a trading day this limitation was addressed by the introduction of exchangetraded funds etfs etfs which must be registered under the investment company act of  allow investors to buy and sell and short sell equity interests in a “basket” of securities on an intraday basis in the same manner as individually listed securitiesindexbased etfs and actively managed etfsmarket indexes are generally designed to measure the aggregate performance of a group of financial instruments such as securities eg stocks and bonds or futures contracts generation of a market index typically involves selecting financial instruments based on a set of selection criteria then weighting those instruments based on a weighting scheme selection criteria for an equity index for example may include a combination of stock characteristics such as market capitalization whether the stock is domestic or international and growth and value factors weighting schemes may likewise be based on various characteristics of the securities or may simply accord equal weight to all securities selected for the index “weighting” as used herein refers to a method of assigning a proportionate value to securities within a given index or fundsome market indexes are commercially available commercially available indexes are maintained and published by providers such as standard  poors eg the standard  poors  index or “sp ” and dow jones  company eg the dow jones industrial average or “djia” investment companies may offer investors shares of “indexbased etfs” with holdings and allocations that correspond closely to a particular commercially available index in all cases indexbased etfs seek investment results that simply attempt to “track” a commercially available index such as the sp  or the djia tracking can be achieved for example by replication or representative sampling of the indexs securities in the indexbased etf more recently some indexes have gone from broad representation of a market segment to more narrowly focused and alphaseeking indexes “alpha” is an indication of how much an investment outperforms positive alpha or underperforms negative alpha a benchmark indexinvestment companies may also offer investors shares of “actively managed” etfs generally a fund is actively managed if it does not seek to track the performance of a particular commercially available index actively managed etfs thus do not attempt to track a particular index but instead use their own independent selection and weighting strategies in an attempt to outperform a selected benchmark the selection and weighting strategy of an actively managed etf may be a fixed and repeatable set of steps a more subjective process involving the fund manager or a combination of both therefore an etf may be considered “actively managed” even if the holdings in the underlying investment portfolio are selected and weighted based on fixed repeatable algorithms that require no human input conversely an etf is considered to be “indexbased” even if it does not precisely mirror the holdings and allocations of a particular index so long as it seeks investment results that track or enhance the performance of the indexalthough their expense ratios may be higher actively managed etfs can have certain advantages over indexbased etfs for example active management may allow better control of the balance between volatility and risk in a portfolio as another example active management may allow better control of the degree of diversification in a portfolio and depending on the degree of ones belief in the “efficient market theory” actively managed funds may enable a portfolio to focus on market segments that are more likely to outperform the general marketpreviously only indexbased etfs have been available and approved for public offering by the sec available indexbased etfs have included spdr trust series  “spy” based on the sp  index and ishares russell  index fund “iwv” based on the russell  indexbrief summary of the inventionthe present invention provides

via  keyboard  which is operatively connected to processor   downloaded from an internet server not shown or  transferred from a local storage medium not shown for example the data which is input to and stored in database  may include the names of or a representation of an initial selection of stocks such as stocks selected by one or more fund managersfor example the largest  domestic stocks can be stored in database  as another example the largest  international stocks can be stored in database  as used in this specification “domestic stocks” are stocks of companies listed on a us exchange that are domiciled in the us us territories or possessions or in certain tax havens such as cayman islands and bermuda “international stocks” are those stocks that are not domestic stocks a data entry person can make use of a table  or the like to keyin the data using keyboard  ie data entered by keyboard  is obtained by processor  and loaded into database  table  includes a listing  of each of the entered stocks alternatively the data may be downloaded into database  from another server or memory or from a feed stream directly transmitted from a provider such as standard  poors for examplethe database  can store information identifying each stock it contains such as the name andor symbol of the stock other data relating to each stock as of the close on a selection date can also be entered and stored in database  in association with its respective stock name andor symbol such other data may be taken from table  or the like and includes growth data represented by a set of growth factors  and value data represented by a set of value factors  for each stock again the data entry person may make use of table  to keyin the other data so as to store the other data in database  or such other data may be downloaded to database  for storagein accordance with at least one embodiment of the present technology the growth factors  that are characteristic of the stocks in database  include but are not limited to all or some of  month price appreciation  month price appreciation  month price appreciation  pricetosales ratio and  year sales growth the value factors  that are characteristic of the stocks in database  in accordance with at least one embodiment of the present technology include but are not limited to all or some of  pricetobook value ratio  pricetocash flow ratio and  return on assets“price appreciation” refers to the increase in price per share over the designated time period eg   or  months in accordance with one embodiment the higher a stocks price appreciation the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology“pricetosales ratio” or ps ratio can be calculated for example by dividing the companys market capitalization the number of shares multiplied by the share price as of the close on the selection date by the companys total sales over the  months preceding the selection date in accordance with one embodiment the lower a stocks ps ratio the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology like other ratios described herein it can be calculated equivalently on a pershare basis the calculation may be performed by processor  using component values entered into database  and such calculated factors may be stored in database  alternatively the calculated factors may be entered directly to the database  if they are precalculated by hand or machine or are available from a data provider such precalculated factors would be seen at   in table “year sales growth” is year over year change in the trailing  months of sales per share in accordance with one embodiment the higher a stocks year sales growth the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology“pricetobook value ratio” or pb ratio is a financial ratio used to compare a companys current market price to its book value it can be calculated by for example dividing the companys market capitalization as of the close on the selection date by the companys total book value from its balance sheet as of the close on the selection date in accordance with one embodiment the lower a stocks pb ratio the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology“pricetocash flow ratio” or pcf ratio is a ratio used to compare a companys cash flow to its market value it can be calculated by dividing the companys market capitalization as of the close on the selection date by the companys operating cash flow in the  months preceding the selection date in accordance with one embodiment the lower a stocks pcf ratio the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technology“return on assets” roa shows how efficient a companys assets are in generating profits as used herein roa over the last four quarters for example can be measured by quarterly income either before or after extraordinary items and less preferred dividends divided by average assets value over the past four quarters in accordance with one embodiment the higher a stocks roa percentage is the better rank that stock gets in the ranking step of the present technologyreferring again to fig  software application  is executed by processor  in order to carry out all or some of program flow  as shown in fig  in accordance with one embodiment of the present technologyreferring to fig  in step  of flow  information of an initial selection of securities is input into a database such as database  the initial selection of securities may consist of either domestic or international stocks as described above and may be based at least in part on market capitalization this step may be performed as described above in connection with fig  for examplein step  of flow  each stock is scored using one or more growth and one or more value factors in some embodiments each stock may then be assigned one or more growth factor ranks and one or more value factor ranks for example each of  stocks may be ranked from  to  for each of month price appreciation month price appreciation month price appreciation year sales growth pricetosales ratio pricetobook ratio pricetocash flow ratio and return on assets in some embodiments a raw growth score may then be determined for each stock by summing the ranks of the growth factor rankings and a raw value score may be determined for each stock by summing the ranks of the value factor rankings stocks may then be ranked separately on both their raw growth and raw value scores a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform all or part of these steps if a factor of a stock cannot be computed or used to rank a stock that stock may be given the lowest possible ranking for that factorin step  of flow  a selection score is determined for each stock the selection score may be based on the growth or value factor scores or rankings the raw growth or raw value scores or rankings or a combination thereof in some embodiments the selection score of a stock is set equal to the better of the raw growth ranking and the raw value ranking in some embodiments the selection score of a stock is set equal to the better of a final growth score and a final value score wherein the final growth scores and final value scores are based on the ranks according to raw growth and raw value score and on a quantitative style overlay the quantitative style overlay is applied to determine the weighting factor given to growth and value models within a stock portfolio and may operate by multiplying the raw growth and raw value score rankings by the appropriate weighting factors to determine each stocks final growth and final value score respectively the selection score may then be set equal to the better of the final growth and final value scores or to the better of a ranking based on the final growth score and a ranking based on the final value score a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform all or part of these steps calculated scores andor rankings may be stored in database  for examplein step  of flow  stocks are ranked based at least in part on selection scores in some embodiments each stock in the initial selection of stocks is ranked for example from  to  based on its selection score various tiebreaking schemes will readily suggest themselves such as giving a better ranking to a stock with a selection score that was set equal to its final value score than a stock with the same selection score but where the selection score was set equal to its final growth score a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this step calculated rankings may be stored in database  for examplein step  of flow  a predetermined amount of the lowest ranking stocks ranked by selection score are eliminated for example the lowest ranked  of stocks or the lowest ranked  stocks may be eliminated from the initial selection of securities a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  the remaining stocks are divided into a plurality of subgroups for example the remaining stocks may be divided into subgroups based on their selection score rankings as another example the remaining stocks may be divided into subgroups based on their raw growth andor raw value scores andor rankings in some embodiments the stocks are divided into quintiles a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  a stock portfolio is generated by weighting the remaining stocks according to subgroup the subgroups containing higher ranking or scoring stocks may receive more weight within the stock portfolio and each stock within a subgroup is equally weighted where the subgroups are quintiles for example the top ranked quintile may receive   of the stock portfolio weight with successful quintiles receiving       and   respectively with stocks being equally weighted within each quintile a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  an exchangetraded find is offered based on the stock portfolio generated in step  in some embodiments the stocks in the stock portfolio can be rebalanced and reconstituted at least a portion of the stocks may be rebalanced and reconstituted periodically for example on the last business day of each calendar quarter according to certain embodiments the stocks and their weights may be rebalanced and reconstituted on a quarterly selection date the selected stocks and their weights in the stock portfolio can be rebalanced and reconstituted according to a proper daily index values calculation methodology for example the stock of an acquired company can be deleted from the stock portfolio at the close on the day the merger closes for both cash and stock deals the acquired companys weight in the stock portfolio can be reallocated prorata among the remaining portfolio constituents for example for another example in accordance with one embodiment the stock of a spinoff is not included in the stock portfolio and the value of the spinoff can be reallocated to its parent companyfig  shows a more specific embodiment of the present technology referring again to fig  software application  is executed by processor  in order to carry out a program flow  as shown in fig referring to fig  in step  of flow  information of the largest by market capitalization  domestic or international stocks is input into a database such as database  as noted above for this specification “domestic stocks” are stocks of companies listed on a us exchange that are domiciled in the us us territories or possessions or in certain tax havens such as cayman islands and bermuda and “international stocks” are those stocks that are not domestic stocks the input information corresponds to the information as of the close of trading on a selection date such as the last business day of a calendar quarter this step may be performed as described above in connection with fig  for examplein step  of flow  each of the  stocks from step  is scored and ranked according to growth factors and value factors in this embodiment growth factors are   and month price appreciation year sales growth and pricetosales ratio and value factors are pricetobook ratio pricetocash flow ratio and return on assets thus each stock has five growth factor scores five growth factor ranks three value factor scores and three value factor ranks a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  the five growth factor ranks are summed for each stock to determine a raw growth score for that stock for example if a stock is ranked  for month price appreciation  for month price appreciation  for month price appreciation  for year sales growth and  for pricetosales ratio its raw growth score would be   a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  the three value factor ranks are summed for each stock to determine a raw value score for that stock for example if a stock is ranked  for pricetobook ratio  for pricetocash flow ratio and  for return on assets its raw value score would be   a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  each stock is ranked from  to  according to raw growth score and from  to  according to raw value score a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  the selection score of each stock is set equal to the better of its raw growth score rank and its raw value score rank alternatively in some embodiments a quantitative style overlay may be applied at the beginning of or prior to this step the quantitative style overlay determines the weighting factor given to growth and value models within a stock portfolio and may operate by multiplying the raw growth and raw value score rankings by the appropriate weighting factors to determine each stocks final growth and final value score respectively the selection score may then instead be set equal to the better of the final growth and final value scores or to the better of a ranking based on the final growth score and a ranking based on the final value score a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform any of these stepsin step  of flow  stocks are ranked from  to  according to their selection scores a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  the bottom  of stocks are eliminated based on selection score rankings ie the lowestworst ranked  stocks are eliminated from the initial  a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  the remaining top  or  stocks are divided into quintiles based on raw growth and raw value ranks for example the top quintile of the remaining  stocks ie the top  remaining stocks may be grouped together as a result of those stocks having the highest raw growth rank the highest raw value rank or the highest selection score which is based on raw growth andor value rank or score a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  a stock portfolio is generated by weighting the remaining  stocks according to quintile for example the top ranked quintile may receive   of the stock portfolio weight with successful quintiles receiving       and   respectively stocks are equally weighted within each quintile thus for example the  topranked stocks would overall have a  weight of the stock portfolio the next  stocks would have an overall  weight of the stock portfolio etc a routine  fig  may be called and executed by processor  fig  so as to perform this stepin step  of flow  an exchangetraded fund is offered based on the stock portfolio in some embodiments the stocks in the stock portfolio can be rebalanced and reconstituted as described above

life  references  external links early lifeedit hogg was the son of sir james weir hogg bt the administratorgeneral of bengal and chairman of the british east india company and was born in calcutta his surname at birth was merely hogg but he added the surname mcgarel on  february  on inheriting the estates of charles mcgarel his brotherinlaw careeredit he was educated at eton college and christ church oxford but left oxford early without taking his degree to enter the army and became a lieutenantcolonel in the life guards part of the household cavalry on retiring from the army he went into politics being elected unopposed as a conservative mp for bath in  he was also a member of st george hanover square vestry a form of local government similar to a parish council from  he was chosen by the vestry to represent them on the metropolitan board of works which coordinated crosslondon building schemes he was defeated for reelection in bath in  and concentrated on his work on the board and after the death of sir john thwaites who had chaired the board since it was created he was elected as the new chairman on  november  hogg was elected mp for truro in an  byelection and retained that seat until he transferred to hornsey at the  general election his parliamentary duties made it more difficult for hogg to be a fulltime chairman of the board while his predecessor had dismissed staff who he felt were not up to the job hogg used his influence to try to keep their jobs safe unlike thwaites he did not look in detail at the work of the staff but let them get on with their work this meant that departments within the board became either very efficient or very inefficient the architects department was particularly noted for inefficiency several of the boards big schemes were just being completed when mcgarelhoggs chairmanship began the victoria embankment had been opened shortly before he was elected and he got to share in the rewards for the boards successes being made a knight commander of the order of the bath in  when the chelsea embankment was opened under mcgarelhogg the board bought up all of the bridges over the thames and freed them of tolls however the boards desire for a new bridge by little tower hill could not be fulfilled because its revenue source was not secure tower bridge was eventually built by the city of london corporation the board also acquired the power to clear slums in  but found the process cumbersome and expensive resulting in small progress although it accelerated when further acts of parliament removed some restrictions several parks were also bought by the board and opened to the public however mcgarelhoggs administration was hit by scandal in  over the sale of surplus land blighting somewhat the award of a peerage in the celebrations of queen victorias golden jubilee a royal commission found officers and two members of the board guilty of malpractice this resulted in the decision to abolish the board and replace it with a directlyelected council magheramorne had fought for the board to get permission to build a tunnel at blackwall and it had been granted in  the tenders for the contract came in early in  when the london county council had been elected but was not yet in control he was determined to grant the contract through the board and resisted the lccs request that it leave the decision to them however when the lcc discovered the boards intention to seal the contracts they appealed to the government and the board was abolished on  march  funerary monument brompton cemetery london later
