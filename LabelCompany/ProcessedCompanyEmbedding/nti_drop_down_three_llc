november   kim lubelsan antonio  kim lubel chairman president and ceo of cst brands inc expressed confidence during the thirdquarter  earnings call that the company will meet its goal of opening  newtoindustry nti convenience stores this year and she was equally optimistic that the company will build between  and  nti sites in we anticipate this level of organic growth to continue in future years supported by our partnership with crossamerica said lubel  were not letting any grass grow beneath our feet she said referring to both organic growth plans and synergies from acquisitionsto date weve opened  stores and plan to open  more between now and the end of the year she continued by the end of  we will have built and opened  new to industry stores in the last two years alone  more than the total built over the previous five years … and our new largerformat stores generate on average almost twice the inside store sales and fuel sales as our core legacy storeslubel also offered an update on the sale of the approximately  convenience stores that the company is divesting as part of its network optimization planbids for these convenience stores have been received and evaluated by our management team and we expect to close on the sale of  to  of these convenience stores over the next two quarters as of today weve already closed on  of those sites she announcedcst brands also recently closed on the purchase of the general partner and incentive distribution rights of crossamerica partners lp the former lehigh gas partners allentown pa and on the acquisition of canastota nybased nice n easy grocery shoppes inc with crossamericathe new builds and these deals show that the company will continue to grow in the future both organically and through acquisitions we believe that the convenience retail market remains fragmented with many retail wholesale and combined opportunities she said we intend to focus on and prioritize those opportunities that make the most economic sense for cst brands and crossamericalubel would not provide an exact dropdown schedule for cstores to crossamerica but said we are looking at ntis that are potential dropdowns as those that have been built and open since weve spun out of valero in may  … we would expect to drop those down here in the coming months but we havent set out a specific schedule for those yet so thats how we view the nti dropdown piece including eventually over time as weve said before the fuel supply to both our ntis and our legacy stores is another mlp master limited partnership asset that will over time be dropped into the partnershipas for the current mergersandacquisition landscape she said it is certainly a market that is ripe for consolidation and i think between cst and crossamerica combined were really at the forefront of that consolidation process as we look at acquisition opportunities we dont have a specific network size in mind we really want to look at stores that fit both kind of what csts perspective is on instore sales opportunities but also have decent fuel volume sales to help out with the partnership side of thingsshe continued in terms of geography one of the reasons that we changed the name from lehigh gas to crossamerica was really to reflect the fact that we expect to grow across the us with our partnership with crossamerica and i think our acquisition of nice n easy shows just that we stepped out pretty far out of our marketplace up to upstate new york for that acquisition and with that got some terrific store operations and some strong fuel sales that will also help on the mlp sideminimizing that geographic leap lubel said where those stores are located theyre actually not that far from our canadian base and clearly driving distance from allentown as well so there is some scale that were building up in that part of the country as well … this is a national world and cpg consumer packaged goods companies are national companies and we have strong relationships with the cpg companies that we do business with theyre the same companies that are doing business in new york so we expect that many of the synergies that we get will come

tier energy nysenti  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»northern tier energy  crack spread is key to next earnings reportjul  about northern tier nti bruder capital llc longshort equity dividend investing eventdriven bondsbruder capitalsummarynorthern tier energy lp share prices are rebounding from a dip at q endnti shares trade price is very much linked to crack spreads and specifically the  crack spreadheres what you should know in advance of the august th earnings report datenorthern tier energy lp nyse nti is up  year to date but that figure includes a  price drop in q the second quarter price drop occurred even after nti posted excellent q results and upped its dividend from  cents per share in february to  in may that implied a  month dividend yield of  i suspect that  month dividend yield will go higher when nti reports q results on august th good results higher expectations rising dividends  but until the china and greece crises dissipated a lower price it begs the question why did nti common shares drop so hard last quarter… moreover should investors expect similar treatment from the market after nti pays out its next dividend in midaugust… getting down with my nti self northern tier energy lp is an independent downstream energy company headquartered in tempe az with refining retail and pipeline operations that serve the padd ii midwest region of the united states ntis st paul park minnesota refinery processes  barrels per stream day the refinery is in a geographically advantageous position able to source bakken crude at a cheaper price than what other refiners pay for west texas intermediate crude canadian crude is  of its feedstock while  is sourced in the us ntis end products are  gasoline  distillates  asphalt and  other along with the refinery nti owns storage and transportation assets including a light products terminal a heavy products terminal storage tanks rail loadingunloading facilities and a mississippi river dock on its retail side nti operates  superamerica trademarked convenience stores and franchises another  convenience stores the superamerica stores are concentrated in the twin cities in minnesota and in western wisconsin between  and  of the st paul park refinerys gasoline is sold through the superamerica system last nti owns a bakery and commissary under the supermoms brand nti is headquartered in tempe arizona ntis general partner is western refining inc nyse wnr wnr owns  of ntis limited partnership interests and at a  billion equity market capitalization dwarfs ntis  billion market capitalization in november  wnr purchased its nti partnership position for  million  the sellers were tpg capital and other private equity holders wnr separately owns refineries in el paso tx and gallup nm retail service stations convenience stores and unmanned fleet fueling locations in arizona colorado new mexico and texas and  of the limited partnership interest of western refining logistics lp nysewnrl on the mergers and acquisitions front wnr may decide to purchase the remaining  of nti that it doesnt already own and nti management is separately considering the sale of logistics assets for now however investors should evaluate nti on a standalone basis which means you are looking at a single refinery partnership paying a variable dividend based on distributable cash flow that changes over time since investors dont know exactly what they will be paid from quarter to quarter there is a tendency to discount nti common units based on expectations of its distributable cash flow how ntis doing for the  months ending q nti generated  billion revenue  million adjusted ebitda and  million of free cash flow net debt to adjusted ebitda fell to x from the financial summary table below the most salient operating statistics you should note are the spike up in q operating and ebitda margins operating margin ran  in q versus  in q and  in q and adjusted ebitda margin was  in q versus  in q and  in q the solid increase in margins translated into  of earnings per share or  adjusted eps this allowed nti to distribute  per common unit on may th dramatically up from the previous quarters  cent distribution ive included in the table below consensus estimates for the june and september quarters what drives the partnerships ability to make higher distributions is the crack spread and implicitly any estimate of ntis profitability will revolve around an estimate of what its crude oil feedstock cost will look like before we get to that discussion first let me draw your attention to why that crack spread is so important nti  mm q q q q qe qe revenue       cgs     sga     op income       interest exp     nonop lnyseg     tax exp     inc bef xo       xo loss net     net income

dtadjebitda x x x x               source co filings           its the refinery stupid ntis st paul park refinery operations are easily the most important part of the company per the segment analysis in the table below last quarter nti booked  million revenue from its refinery operations and  million in adjusted ebitda by comparison its retail operations generated  million revenue and  million ebitda in q i have detailed this in the segment analysis below there are intercompany eliminations that tie in to the consolidated numbers but any analysis of nti should logically start with the companys most important revenue and profit contributor its refinery business i most want to draw your attention to the additional information ive included in this segment analysis viz wti crude prices and the  crack spread i am showing you in the table what the average crude price was in each quarter a proxy for but not ntis actual feedstock cost i am using the wti cushing crude oil  ulsd crack spreadny harbor as a proxy for but not ntis actual margin per barrel of throughput note that when that crack spread is higher ntis gross margin per barrel of throughput tends to be higher at an average  crack spread in q ntis gross margin was  per barrel but at an average  crack spread in q ntis gross margin was  per barrel given the st paul park refinerys location and its flexibility ie the ability to crack different types of crude that  gross margin per barrel is one of the highest you will see among independent refiners in q in q however investors watching for clues beyond crack spreads also saw the canadian crude differential to wti and bakken crude differential to wti tighten up thats the most likely explanation for the dip at q end segments  mm q q q q qe refining revenue

scheduled to release its q results on tuesday august th before the market opens note a conference call with management is scheduled for  am the same day domestic call in number  use pin code  for q management guidance is  to  of throughput at the refinery with  to  coming from heavy crude management tends to be conservative in its guidance direct operating expenses at saint paul park are expected by management to be  per barrel of throughput not including turnaround expenditures thats higher than the  figure that management expected for q management also expects capital expenditures to be higher in q at  million versus the  million expenditure in q management had previously forecast an  million capex spend for q at the end of last year im looking forward to seeing the earnings release in particular i will want to know what gross margin per barrel of throughput looked like in q but i can already take a stab at what it might be note that at  the average  crack spread in q was slightly above what we saw in q unless throughput volumes were down significantly from the first quarter id expect nti to report a q level of distributable cash flow that was fairly close to q and a dividend payment that could easily beat the  we saw in q disclosure i amwe are long nti i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than

tier team through a number of changes and was very supportive of bringing these  companies together we appreciate his leadership and wish him the best going forward were excited about the announcement that dave lamp will be joining nti as president and ceo in march dave brings a wealth of industry knowledge and experience to northern tier and will be a valuable addition to the leadership team last year at this time i outlined our goals for  which were to improve performance in safety and reliability increase our investment in the business particularly logistics and continue to return cash to shareholders i would like to briefly discuss some of western refinings achievements related to these goals we had a good year from a safety and reliability standpoint operationally our refineries ran well with the el paso refinery having a particularly strong second half of the year we successfully completed the ipo of western refining logistics as part of the offering we secured a  million revolver this revolver along with the  million in ipo proceeds which we retained at wnrl will be available to fund both organic and acquisition growth in april we began operations of our delaware basin logistic system a  barrel per day pipeline and a  barrel per day truck offloading station as weve discussed previously this logistics system will allow el paso to process up to a  barrels per day of higher yielding cost advantage crude oil from the delaware basin we also added  crude oil transports in  and are currently gathering about  barrels per day in the permian basin in november we purchased the general partner and  of the limited partnership interest in nti were very excited about the addition of st paul park refinery which shares key characteristics of our el paso and gallup refineries specifically direct pipeline access to cost advantage crude oil from growing basins and attractive product regions in  we repurchased approximately  million shares for  million at an average cost of  during the year we increased the dividend  times and paid out total dividends of approximately  million including both share repurchases and dividend payments western refinery returned approximately  million to shareholders in  im very proud of our team here at western and id like to thank them for helping us achieve our goals in delivering a very successful year turning to the fourth quarter we reported net income excluding special items of  million the brent wti spread widened in the fourth quarter from the second and third quarters southwest frac ph pricing strengthened relative to q particularly phoenix gas cracks and west coast margins also increased in the third quarter our wholesale business performed well in the quarter with volumes up by  compared to q  this was largely due to expanding our geographical footprint in the southwest we continued to opportunistically grow our retail business during the fourth quarter we added  new locations in yuma arizona as you know the retail business is important to us as it provides a secure outlet for our refinery production and helps with our rin compliance as we look forward at the first quarter of  the brent wti spread remained volatile and we are seeing a stronger gulf coast  of approximately  per barrel in addition the wti midland cushing differentials have continued to widen during the quarter operationally we are wrapping up our planned turnaround on the south side of the el paso refinery this week western does not have any additional turnarounds planned for the remainder of  for  we have established the following corporate goals first we will continue to focus on safety and reliability second westerns board has approved the  capital budget of  million of which  million is for discretionary projects the  biggest projects are the completion of the texnew mex pipeline reversal and the construction of mile extension pipeline connecting the texnew mex pipeline to the delaware basin third we will continue to realize synergies related to westerns investment in nti and finally well continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in january westerns board approved a first quarter  dividend of  per share the board also authorized an additional  million in share repurchases these actions are consistent with our goal of returning cash to shareholders now i will turn the call over to gary who will go through our fourth quarter financials in more detail gary r dalke thank you jeff before i begin i would like to remind everyone that beginning with the fourth quarter we are required to consolidate all  entities western wnrl and nti nti and wnrl will continue to report on a standalone basis however in the wnr press releases we provide consolidating information refining gross margins in the fourth quarter of  are not entirely comparable to prior periods as a result of fees paid by our refining segment to wnrl starting october   similarly refining direct operating expenses were reduced in the fourth quarter due to certain expenses now being recorded by wnrl that were previously included in refining we have provided pro forma information on these statistics for comparison purposes for the fourth quarter gross margins per barrel for el paso and gallup were  and  respectively margins as compared to the prior year quarter were impacted primarily by both the margin environment and by fees paid to wnrl direct operating expenses for the quarter were  million as compared to  million for the prior year quarter the main driver behind the increase was the inclusion of nti with q operating expenses of  million on a perbarrel basis el paso and gallup operating expenses for the quarter were  and  respectively gallups operating costs were elevated due to a  million environmental reserve adjustment and lower throughput for the quarter primarily as a result of a power failure in october pro forma excluding wnrl gross margins and operating expenses per barrel are included in our supporting slides total company sga for the quarter was  million depreciation and amortization expense was  million for the quarter interest expense was  million for q  a bridge showing changes in cash position for the quarter can be found on page  of our slide deck there were a number of onetime items associated with both the nti and wnrl transactions consolidated yearend cash ended up at  million of which  million was attributable to westerns standalone total capital expenditures for the quarter were  million as of december  total consolidated debt stood at  billion excluding debt attributable to nti westerns total debt was  billion a summary of our consolidated capital structure and westerns standalone capital structure is available on page  of our slides total liquidity which we define as cash and availability under our revolver was approximately  million at the end of the year liquidity has averaged approximately  million thus far in  wrapping up you can find our first quarter operating guidance on page  of our slides our q guidance includes the impact of the el paso turnaround that concludes our remarks for western refining i will now turn the call over to chet kuchta coo for nti chester j kuchta thanks gary this morning we reported our fourth quarter and full year  results and earlier this month we declared our quarterly distribution of  per unit this distribution was effected by our planned turnaround on our catalytic cracking unit and some unplanned downtime both of which i will go into further we have declared distributions totaling  per unit for  and  per unit since our initial public offering as you can see on slide  of the nti slide presentation our fourth quarter  operating income was  million compared to  million for the fourth quarter of  this decrease in operating income was primarily the result of a significant decrease in the group   benchmark and a decrease in the throughput resulting from our planned cat unit turnaround during the month of october and some unplanned downtime at the st paul park refinery the unplanned downtime was primarily as a result of a fire in our larger crude tower which caused us to run at reduced rates for approximately  weeks during the third and fourth quarters the cost of the repairs and clean up of this fire amounted to less than  million for the full year of  we reported operating income of  million compared to  million in  again this decrease was affected by a reduced throughput and due to a  decrease in the  crack spread in  as you can see on slide  our gross product margin per barrel throughput averaged  per barrel in the fourth quarter of  compared to  in the  fourth quarter this decrease was driven primarily by a more modest market crack as the group   crack spread averaged  per barrel in the fourth quarter of  as compared to  per barrel in the  quarter the st paul park refinery was able to recognize a considerably higher gross margin into wider crude differentials during the fourth quarter of  ntis total throughput averaged approximately  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day for the fourth quarter of  the decrease in throughput was primarily due to our planned and unplanned downtime at the st paul park refinery which i mentioned earlier full year throughput was  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in  operating expenses per barrel of throughput excluding turnaround expenses were  in the fourth quarter of  compared to  in the fourth quarter of  the increase in operating expenses per barrel of throughput is primarily due to the lower throughput levels i just mentioned the commercial environment in  was not as favorable as it was in  given that we planned for our major turnaround work in  we also took advantage of downtime in order to make certain strategic investments at the refinery these projects which are referred to on slide  resulted in an expansion of over  of our capacity and also resulted in providing enhanced distillate yields lastly ntis retail segment achieved a record year and we continue to opportunistically grow that business with that ill turn it over to dave bonczek for further discussions of our quarterly financial results david bonczek thanks chet on a gaap basis we reported net income of  million for the fourth quarter of  compared to  million in the fourth quarter of  on a nongaap basis adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of  was approximately  million compared to fourth quarter  adjusted ebitda of approximately  million as we previously noted these decreases are primarily due to lower throughput rates caused by our planned and unplanned downtime in addition to a weaker benchmark crack as of now were operating at economically justifiable rates unaffected by any downtime our throughput for the month of january was approximately  barrels per day as you can see on slide  we continue to maintain ample liquidity and minimum leverage in the company we had approximately  million in cash on hand and total liquidity of  million as of december   our leverage ratio measured by total debt to last  months adjusted ebitda is at x cash flow from operations was  million in the fourth quarter of  cash flow from operations was impacted this quarter as a result of our planned and unplanned downtime and increases in working capital as we return to normal operations we expect to see improvements in both our cash flow from operations and our liquidity position as we continue to operate the refinery at economically justifiable rates and capture improving margins and healthy crude differentials cash available for distribution amounted to approximately  million for this quarter which equates to a  distribution per unit slide  shows the detailed calculation of cash available for distribution as we have said in the past we are a variable rate mlp and quarterly distribution will vary as a direct result of variations in certain factors including fluctuations in throughput the prices of crude oil and other feedstocks refined product prices capital expenditures and other cash reserves deemed necessary and appropriate by the board of directors of our general partner unlike most publicly traded partnerships we do not have a minimum quarterly distribution finally you can find our updated key metric guidance for the first quarter of  on slide  i will now turn it back to jeff stevens for closing remarks jeff a stevens thanks dave over the past few years westerns strong financial performance has allowed us to improve our balance sheet and provide us the platform to transform the company in  we grew our business substantially by adding western refining logistics and northern tier energy while continuing to return cash to shareholders with this expanded asset base and the unique geographic location of our refineries we believe western is well positioned to continue this performance in  jackie we will now open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ed westlake from crédit suisse edward westlake  crédit suisse ag research division lets start with logistics i mean obviously youve talked about the new texmex pipe reversal but maybe give us a sort of a color on the run rate of where you are it would be helpful if you included the ebitda on nti logistics as well and where you expect to be able to get to over the next couple of years jeff a stevens sure ed as far as growing the logistics like we said in the script we really set a platform for both organic growth and the potential of dropdowns from an organic standpoint as we highlighted the delaware basin has quite a bit of capacity to increase and we believe as the new wells comes on that we believe the throughput will increase quite a bit through that system in the first  in the fourth quarter and we are seeing a little bit of this in january because of the glut of oil that weve seen in just the overall permian basin along with some weather issues and our turnaround our throughputs have kind of leveled off but we believe that as we come back up on run rate well see a significant increase in the delaware business so thats just pure organic growth that well see utilizing existing assets within the mlp as far as the texnew mex and the mile extension we believe those  the texnew mex will be ready to operate in the fourth quarter of  and then the additional  miles to bring crude all the way to the el paso refinery out of the  corners will be available probably in early first quarter of  so those are obviously  projects that were very excited about that are well on their way to being developed and be in a position for dropdowns into wnrl now with regards to northern tiers logistic assets obviously they have some very attractive assets to an mlp they have interest in a crude pipeline they have other tankage and traditional storage type assets and right now were evaluating the ebitda but we think its in a range of probably  million to  million for those nti potential dropdown assets and as we get further down in the process and as we look at the right opportunity the right time to potentially have those in wnrl well continue to evaluate it and were just excited about those assets and their potential in wnrl someday edward westlake  crédit suisse ag research division yes i think investors are excited also but maybe just on the sort of wnr ebitda run rate for logistics as a current run rate or  run rate would be helpful not wnrl but including everything that you have at the parent as well if you have that number jeff a stevens well yes we have not established a tariff yet for the texnew mex system so until we do that we really cant give any guidance relative to what that exactly will be but weve guided people relative to the growth at wnrl somewhere between  and  just based on the organic and the existing dropdowns at wnr operator our next question comes from the line of robert kessler with tudor pickering holt robert a kessler  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc research division i had a few questions about westerns intended use of the nti variable mlp structure and kind of the tax implications of that i suppose the first and perhaps most obvious is will you and when will you drop another refinery down into nti and then assuming you do how would you  would you take back units in nti to get installment sale gain treatment for tax purposes and then would you then take those nti units and distribute those to wnr shareholders and would that in turn be a taxable event jeff a stevens sure robert our thoughts right now around obviously were excited about the nti investment obviously the profile of that refinery and its direct pipeline access to both the bakken and canadian crudes is very attractive to us as far as the potential of dropping down wnr assets or refineries into the variable rate obviously by making this investment it gives us the optionality to look at that right now the multiples on variable mlps and ccorps have narrowed in and its something that were watching and looking at but ultimately the decisions that well make relative to the potential dropdowns of wnr refineries into nti will  were going to look at whats in the best interest of the shareholders and the unitholders of nti and as we get down the road well be able to get more guidance relative to what our thought processes is around that robert a kessler  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc research division any early look at the tax scenarios i mean youve undoubtedly taken some consideration of that even if you havent made a decision any kind of early read on how that will be structured jeff a stevens no robert were still evaluating that and looking at all our options robert a kessler  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc research division can i ask on the nti midstream side in particular the  interest in the minnesota pipeline how that would work for a presumed sale to wnrl im assuming that nti is the primary customer for  of that line and yet only having a minority interest in the pipeline it seems to me like that can be a little bit different than what we typically see for a refinery pipeline interest transferred to the mlp on the midstream side in that you dont get the markup and the ebitda or if you do it would be kind of dilutive because youre giving away  of the ebitda on the refining side only to get back  at the premium multiple thats one kind of question i had and the other is youre taking this from one taxadvantaged entity and putting into another taxadvantaged entity do you lose some of the markup advantage on that side that you would typically have on a refinery to mlp dropdown jeff a stevens sure in relationship to the minnesota pipeline were not the only customer in fact there is another substantial customer that makes up a large portion of that volume that pipelines capacity is around  barrels a day and it runs full most of the time and were only running about  to  barrels of that capacity so there are other parties that have obviously ownership and ship on that line with regards to  obviously that interest can be dropped down from nti into wnrl and what we would look at is it would only make sense robert if we got a pickup a multiple pickup and it made sense but right now where the variable mlp is trading at versus where traditional mlps are trading at that probably looks pretty attractive to us right now operator our next question comes from the line of evan calio with morgan stanley unknown analyst this is monha suri ph quick question you mentioned the midland spread is widening as you go in the quarter but its volatile also any reasons you see out there is it turnarounds are you actually seeing a very strong rebound in permian production what is causing this spread to be so volatile and wider jeff a stevens yes i think its all of the above clearly our turnaround has an impact there is another refinery in the region thats getting ready for turnaround and then theres a couple more turnarounds that well see later here in march and into april and obviously as weve talked about on calls before the takeaway capacity is such that any reduction in takeaway from the local refineries is going to create volatility in that midland spread but i would not discount the fact that there clearly is more crude being produced and its growing at a pretty rapid rate and i think when you see spreads we saw spreads the other day as wide as  that takes a combination of all those factors to see that spread that wide so i think looking forward we obviously dont plan our business around a  midland cushing crack spread but i do think the volatility and anytime there is either a planned or an unplanned outage by one or more of the refineries in the region were going to continue to see the mid cushing be volatile and obviously when el paso is running full that makes a big impact on their overall margin unknown analyst one quick question followup was is there any kind of  are there any specifications on the pipeline in terms of light crude which the pipelines are not willing to carry out of the region because of which there is also volatility over there jeff a stevens well clearly some of the new crude coming on is high in gravity and were starting to see pipelines address that either through deducts or just not taking that crude at all thats something that we believe will continue to be a challenge for the producers and for the pipeline companies is to figure out how to get a lighter crude out of the market there will be some obviously  for us that have assets and access to different grades of crude there will be blending economics there for us but longerterm there is going to have to be something either a dedicated pipeline or some way to get the lighter ends out of the market but that continues to be an issue operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of chi chow with macquarie chi chow  macquarie research on the western side youve got some moving pieces on the companys debt position this year with the new term loan facility from the intrial ph transaction the convert coming due can you give us a roadmap on what we can expect on how you positioned  your debt position going to change as you go through this year jeff a stevens yes chi the way we look at it obviously the converted the first piece that needs to be addressed its a june settlement that well need to make and right now as you know we have basically  options out there to settle that we can do it either through stock only or cash only or a combination and were still evaluating what the best scenario is and well address that obviously in june when we look at the term piece thats obviously a pretty attractive piece of paper but as we get further in the year and we start looking for uses of free cash flow were going to continue to focus on potential share repurchases and dividends but we might look at taking down some debt towards the end of the year based on how the year is going relative to crack spreads chi chow  macquarie research whats the interest rate on the term loan jeff a stevens its about  chi chow  macquarie research okay great and then on the new financial reporting i guess are the retailers also being consolidated in q it just doesnt seem like the store count really rose at all and are the northern tier retail financials in that number gary r dalke yes chi this is gary whats included in our nti are basically  weeks of results starting november  through the end of the year so for that time period it does include the results of retail from nti as well as the refinery results for nti so our store count is  and ntis is plus with their franchise stores so the  weeks results from nti are definitely included in our results chi chow  macquarie research okay and then i guess on the turnaround expense youre showing  million consolidated northern tier is showing  million is that just a timing issue at northern tier gary r dalke yes northern tier basically spent that prior to november  so the  million that you see that came through in the fourth quarter really relates to the el paso turnaround some spending going into that turnaround chi chow  macquarie research okay great and then on the northern tier side chet maybe you can talk about  can you talk about your canadian crude purchases how much you are buying that right now and are those purchases on a  months lag on a trademonth basis thats my understanding but i just wanted to get that confirmed chester j kuchta yes sure chi the canadian crude for us is roughly a month lag were buying our typical volumes of canadian versus synthetic which were in the range of  to  a day heavy and somewhere between  and  of synthetic was there anything else chi chow  macquarie research do those volumes change at all in the winter months versus the summer on the heavy chester j kuchta on the heavy they do its all around the economics we  heavy crude has been economic for us pretty much the whole  for the past several years with a few instances where it kind of fell out of favor and when it does when the economics go south on that when asphalt gets too cheap and the differential doesnt support it then well trim back on the heavies and go to a lighter slate but for the majority of the time in the recent past it has been justified around full on heavy operator our next question comes from the line of roger read with wells fargo roger d read  wells fargo securities llc research division sorry because i did miss part of the first answer from eds question i just wanted to come back on the mlp thing that everyone else is obviously interested in timing wise if you decide to start moving things in between the various mlps for the obvious favorable directions what should we think about there i mean is this a  could happen by midyear happens later in the year sooner than that im just trying to understand sort of the when not so much the if or the magnitude at this particular point jeff a stevens i think roger when youre looking at wnrl and you look at like i said theyve got  paths theyre going down right now theyve got the organic growth with the existing assets and some smaller projects that well be funding this year that will be growing it we have existing drop downs within wnr that would be ready to drop down and i would expect something to be looked at here as we get further into the year with regards to the nti assets theyre in a similar position that wnr was last year where they have never kept those assets on a standalone basis so theres some work that has to be done from the financial side of getting those in a position to be dropped down so i wouldnt expect any of that probably till early next year as we prepared the  potentially prepare the books financially to be in a position to do that but i think what were looking at is we obviously have quite a bit of organic growth and we have these drop downs and i think youll see the drop downs come in the growth will be somewhat lumpy where the timing between some of the growth may lag and youll see us opportunistically drop down during those times roger d read  wells fargo securities llc research division and then to a true operational question here so el paso youre building out a lot of the pipelines into the various shale play areas there in west texas could you give us an idea of maybe how many barrels now are sort of your captured system versus the legacy pipeline system in there and then maybe how the units been running on those barrels not necessarily something we can see with the actual results given all the other moving parts but just how the unit is performing jeff a stevens yes i think when we talk about the shale crude that were acquiring for el paso were upwards around  to  barrels per day with a target of about  so were just about  there of where we want to be but obviously with the turnaround and having the south side down for the last  days we havent really been able to measure exactly the results but clearly we believe that well see a higher yield pattern of gas and diesel out of the shale crude and less of the lower value products like asphalt and residual so were still very confident in the direction were going and like i said were coming out of that turnaround as we speak right now and in march well be running  full at the facility and we believe as crude kind of makes its way out of midland and the whole system in the permian basin becomes less backed up we have producers that have the crude that we want ready to come into our system and well be able to start really ramping it up as we get in here to the second quarter operator our next question comes from the line of mohit bhardwaj with citigroup mohit bhardwaj  citigroup inc research division i just had a question on the convertible the value in access at the end of september was  million do you guys have an updated value at the end of the year jeff a stevens on the convert jeffrey s beyersdorfer the total convert value at the end of the year the price was  or currently its about  per bond so the total market value probably starts with our  million ph handle about  million again of which weve repurchased shares equivalent to about half of that value of the  million mohit bhardwaj  citigroup inc research division and jeff as you outlined too many things during this call today including ntis logistics and youre potentially looking at say gallup or probably the el paso in the available mlp structure just looking forward this year you guys have your organic growth projects and also potentially the dropdown of your wholesale assets into wnrl if that if this timing for that dropdown would be around the time you settled for your convertible to use the cash thats generated or is that how you guys are thinking about it jeff a stevens obviously that would be an option that we would look at i would say that the timing it doesnt have to be the same but its probably fair to say that the timing of that would be in the same time frame mohit bhardwaj  citigroup inc research division and if i could just one more on the acquisition side you guys have stated before that youre also looking at acquisition opportunities both on the refining and logistics side any update on that jeff a stevens i think that right now i wouldnt anticipate any major acquisition right now we obviously have a full plate and we have a lot of just great organic and internal options here over the next couple of years i think that from a standpoint of adding small logistic assets to complement what we already have whether theyre in the permian basin san juan or now in the bakken i think were looking at those type of acquisitions but those are small in nature operator our final question comes from the line of ed westlake with crédit suisse edward westlake  crédit suisse ag research division while were all looking at the mlp cookie jar i thought id just ask one around the retail following on one of chis question do you think theres a point or whats the point where you think your combined retail business would have critical mass to sort of stand on its own have you given any thought to that jeff a stevens well i mean certainly since the acquisition of the combined  potentially combining the nti and the wnr it certainly changes our thought process relative to size and if there was an opportunity out there that made sense as the standalone thats certainly something that well look at but its approaching that number now ed based just by combining the  together edward westlake  crédit suisse ag research division okay thats helpful im going to guess the logistics and capturing crude probably more profitable in the short term but jeff a stevens no question about it ed we were very fortunate to be in the locations we are and its going to be our job to make sure that we capitalize on this because there is plenty to do and plenty of opportunity out there so were going to stay focused and really concentrate on that operator i would now like to return the call to mr jeff stevens jeff a stevens thanks jackie id
