opportunities get email alerts stay informed about our latest news and updates sign up today market opportunity  biocorrx inc bicx about market opportunity addressing unmet challenges in addiction treatment we have created the biocorrx® recovery program to address some of the biggest previously unmet challenges related to addiction treatment the low rates of longterm sobriety one study for example found that only  of addicts who attended a residential treatment program managed to stay in recovery only about  of that number managed to stay completely clean and sober an elegantly simple solution to reduce cravings in the past treatment has been focused on the emotional needs and behaviors associated with addiction while ignoring or underutilizing pharmacological solutions that go to the heart of addiction the intense craving to use a real illness requires real medication it is much like telling a diabetic who should be prescribed insulin to rely solely on nutrition and exercise without giving them the medications they need to actually treat their medical condition biocorrx® is uniquely poised to gain significant market share of the  billion annual treatment market in the us

addiction treatment programs about biocorrx inc wwwbiocorrxcom biocorrx inc is a healthcare solutions development company on the leading edge of addiction treatment programs the company currently owns an addiction treatment program called the start fresh program sfp that is used by various independently owned licensed addiction clinics throughout the united states the company is currently working on other treatment programs and products that will focus on other health issues and addictions   the start fresh program sfp consists of two components  biocorrx has the worldwide rights except in australia and new zealand to a highly effective proprietary implant compound of the fdaapproved drug naltrexone after being surgically implanted by a medical professional the naltrexone implant significantly reduces cravings for alcohol and opioids for as long as a year in some patients depending on individual metabolism rates furthermore once the implant has dissolved a vast majority of patients are pleased to discover that their physical cravings continue to remain greatly reduced or even eliminated    biocorrx also owns a life coaching program that is tailored specifically to alcoholics and other addictions once a patient has received the implant they are encouraged to enter the life coaching program to maximize results   biocorrx�s revolutionary treatment program sfp has an  success rate as reported by patients that complete the program in routine telephone and face to face interviews conducted by the independently owned and operated clinics using the sfp the implant is administered as an outpatient procedure and in most cases patients do not need to miss more than one day of work they are then able to enter the private life coaching program without coworkers or family members knowing unless they so choose lourdes felix cfo ms felix has been the chief financial officertreasurer of the company since october   and a member of the board since march   ms felix has been instrumental in assisting in capital procurement and implementing an audit committee ms felix is a corporate finance executive offering over twenty years of combined experience in public accounting and in the private sector in building leading and advising corporations through complex restructurings she is thoroughly experienced in guiding troubled companies to greater efficiency and profitability ms felix has acquired expertise in securities laws and knowledge of sox requirements she has worked with private and public sec reporting companies ms felix was previously the controller for a midsize public accounting firm for over seven years and was responsible for the operations and financial management of regional offices her experience includes a wide variety of industries including advertising marketing nonprofit organizations medical practices mortgage banking manufacturing and sec reporting companies she has assisted companies with documented contributions leading to improved financial performance heightened productivity and enhanced internal controls ms felix is very active in the hispanic community and speaks fluent spanish ms felix holds a bachelor of science degree in business management and accounting from university of phoenix �patients report that quote unquote �this was a miracle��  lourdes felix biocorrx inc suite   n parkcenter drive santa ana ca  united states  wwwbiocorrxcom       interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published � march     ceocfo ms felix what attracted you to the biocorrx ms felix what initially attracted me to the company was the help that they were giving to the people addicted to alcohol through the start fresh program during my entire career in the accounting and financial industry i had always envisioned myself wrapping up the last  to  years of my career in an industry that gave back to individual people in need i feel that biocorrx inc is that right place i have been with biocorrx inc now for about a year and a half and i am very excited with the medical technology that the company continues to develop and provide to people suffering from alcohol and now other addictions across the united states   ceocfo what is the biocorrx approach to the problem ms felix the approach to the problem is what makes our company unique we have a rehabilitation program which includes the use of a proprietary formula in the form of a naltrexone implant it is implanted in the patient right underneath the skin and it releases therapeutic levels of the medication over an extended period of time that helps to block the pleasure effects of the alcohol and opioids most patients report that they do not have any cravings almost immediately after the procedure   ceocfo what is it releasing ms felix the implant is a proprietary formulation consisting of the fda approved drug naltrexone that was cleared by the fda for the treatment of alcoholism in  the implant has been able to help patients tremendously in reducing their cravings for alcohol and opioids as well   ceocfo has a similar approach been tried in the past ms felix yes there are other naltrexone implants out there our research shows that they typically last up to  months our implant has been reported to last anywhere from  to  months depending on the person�s metabolism and other factors this is the superior advantage that the start fresh program has over any other addiction programs out there   ceocfo are there any potential side effects mr felix patients report soreness around the area after the medical procedure typically the person can go back to work the next day there is some discomfort but nothing very significant some patients may report inflammation around the surgery site and in rare cases infection can occur as with any other medical procedure other side effects from naltrexone itself can be found on our website faq section   ceocfo who would be a typical candidate for the procedure or is it virtually good across the board ms felix i do not know the correct answer for who would be the correct candidate what we do know is that there is a multitude of family members who�s loved ones are afflicted with alcoholism and other addictions and are seeking help for them as well as the individuals themselves the physicians treating the people with this disease are familiar with the parameters and who would be a perfect candidate for the start fresh program   ceocfo would you tell us about the coaching part of the program ms felix what we have is the start fresh program which consists of the naltrexone implant but the program also includes a coaching portion of the program the coaching portion is vitally important the implant procedure and the coaching go hand and hand the coaching part of the program will help address the psychosocial issues that possibly led the person to drink to begin with it gives them time and clarity to address the mental aspect of the demons they are probably dealing with the clinics report back that their patients have an  success rate if they complete the program this twoprong approach is what makes our program so successful   ceocfo how do you reach clinics that may want to use the start fresh programs and what has been the general reception from that community ms felix the predominant business model that we employ is the licensing of our start fresh program in us territories that desire to implement use and distribute our program we currently have five licensed clinics that use the start fresh program in the us we will speak to anyone in the medical community that has an interest in our program   ceocfo what you are talking with someone do they understand the concept easily or are there some objections you need to overcome ms felix the fortunate part for us is that the very first licensed clinic in santa ana has been treating patients for  years now so the success rate speaks for itself the medical director is familiar with the program   ceocfo why the change of name from fresh start to biocorrx ms felix we decided to change the name to reflect our new vision which consists of adding more programs and product lines in the near future   ceocfo are you funded for the steps you would like to take next and will you be seeking additional funding ms felix funding is something that we are always addressing and considering for our projected future growth at the moment our current business model has enabled us to secure enough resources to maintain a steady business we are now poised for a continued expansion and will seek funding as needed   ceocfo how do you get the public to learn about what you are doing ms felix the licensed clinics do marketing and advertising at the clinic level biocorrx has launched a national tv campaign in an effort to create awareness about the start fresh program   ceocfo put it together for our readers why consider biocorrx ms felix biocorrx has a unique program that directly addresses alcoholism and opioid addiction with a reported  success rate patients report that quote unquote �this was a miracle� this is something that saved their life their family saved their relationship with their spouse we hear these kind of stories nonstop from our licensed clinics and that their patients say that they are astounded with the program these patient testimonials are what motivate us to
