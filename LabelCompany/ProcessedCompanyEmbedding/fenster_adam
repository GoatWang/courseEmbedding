flexibility fascial highway function and discuss how these relate to movement describe the principlebased assessment approach for bioindividuality global local and essentials of observation examine the effects of specific fascial changes such as injury myofascial restructuring altered movement patterns and dysfunction understand and discuss principles of motor control and the relationship of pain and inhibition discuss structurespecific integrated assessment techniques to test motion mobility and stability of the hip lumbopelvic complex and thoracic spine correctly distinguish differences between reactive and traditional anatomy relative to integrated movement successfully leave with treatment strategies for each body part or segment “anyone who has worked with adam would initially characterize him as a “healer” and that would not remotely capture his brilliance adam is so much more than that he intuitively understands that no modality no method nor procedure can outperform your body’s ability to heal itself adam is a facilitator and teacher who guides his patients’ intuitive abilities to heal themselves with a deep understanding between muscles bones nerves tendons and spirit and this book is a demonstration of that” marc davis year nba referee this is a threepart video set— a day handson workshop filmed and edited down to  hours and  minutes video one  minutes what is optimal function if dysfunctional a combination of movement nutrition restrecovery  behavior are out of balance naming the planes of motion influencing motion drivers of body motion behavior driver vs biological driver vs physical driver a driver is a way to create a reaction defining vectors of motion relative to how to name motion transformational zones and how motion is assessed at transformational zones bone position and joint motion are different a foot that’s collapsed should still go through more collapsion it’s the difference between motion and position discussion of bones spinning around axis in planes of motion front foot in gait is bottomup motion back foot in gait is topdown motion continued discussion of naming motion at a joint bones move in the same direction and one moves faster or slower relative to the first transformational zone at the hip and knee assessing knee internal rotation at the first transformational zone biomechanics of the second transformational zone of hip  pelvis topdown motion assessing hip motion at nd transformational zone discussion of postsurgery knee extension and influence of soleus length  capsule tightness that limits knee extension during gait definition of tensegrity relative to the human body discussion of chemical reaction of how tissue binds together and importance of slide and gliding of tissue understanding how a flat foot will influence motion in the back hip and shoulder and truing the system strategies to assess flexibility highways plus progressions and regressions video two  minutes using fascial highways as a warmup static to dynamic spectrum of movement adding drivers and working both spectrums within a plane of movement back hip in gait mobilization in standing on table hip  rearfoot assessment assessment long axis hip  rearfoot distraction and influence on system—is there a synchronous dissociation when long axis distracting assessment strategies specifically tissue assessment neurological or physiological tightness attempt to find a relationship between upregulated and downregulated tissue discussion of motor control principles and how stretching might be inhibiting tissue further and causing more dysfunction foot assessment paper card test for intrinsic foot muscles related to motor control ability to map the cortical system to have independency and not interdependency discussion on the process that occurs when someone is in pain the importance of naming it to tame it introduction discussion of pain science and not creating sympathetic responses in the system pain gate theory mobility vs stability—increase mobility somewhere to stabilize somewhere else soft tissue excursion vs joint excursion vs balance reach is it a soft tissue limitation or soft tissue limitation or motor control limitation discussion of closing angle joint restrictions treatment strategies and pain vs discomfort hip shoulder relationships hip shoulder complex assessment—is there sequential dissociation integrated shoulder complex assessment—is there synchronous dissociation in each plane of motion progressions and regressions start in integration and if you can’t eliminate joints from movement and if pain resolves look in eliminated joints for dysfunction assessing heads of humerus in joint space video three  minutes discussion of table shoulder assessment tensegrity principled softtissue release for subscap to change motor control relationship with tissue motor control off weightbearing shoulder assessment assessing reciprocal inhibitions in the shoulder complex distraction vs compression lumbar facet joint pain assessment and biomechanics of the lumbar facets front foot in gait side closed sagittal closed frontal open transverse back foot in gait closed sagittal open frontal closed transverse discussion of thoracic spine biomechanics and motion at first transformational zone thoracic spine assessment practice speeding up top bone vs slowing lower bone diaphragmatic breathing strategies with metronome breathwork involved for creating parasympathetic response diaphragm rocktape application for feedback and to reeducate behavior pattern of not hinging with diaphragm breath diaphragm assessment on a table utilizing muscle testing and therapy localization to find area of dysfunction foot discussion joints have motion and should have motion on either side of neutral structure issues relative to having motion but never getting positioned creating more ankle motion driving fibular motion to not have anterior ankle binding during the second phase of gait conclusion throughout the workshop adam answers questions for the group so you’ll finish watching with a satisfied feeling that you know what you need to know and it’s up to you and your practice to make things happen if you’re a physical therapist or clinician these are same questions your clients have and you’ll have a new level of confidence in your answers to their queries “adam wolf’s course came highly recommended by a respected colleague and i was not disappointed adam does a masterful job of synthesizing the latest in progressive functional and motor control assessment treatment and exercise prescription then integrates it into manualbased programming the practitioner will find to be immediately clinically applicable his course requires thought attention and some shifting of paradigms but my patient outcomes have improved and my practice has grown as a result” max selich pt adam wolf pt lmt fafs is a physical therapist massage therapist and educator known for creating innovative and effective treatment paradigms through combining a variety of approaches he is a fellow of applied functional science gray institute level  practitioner of neurokinetic therapy nkt functinal neuroorthopedic rehab fnor practitioner and is a master trainer for rehab  reconditioning for vipr his professional career spans nearly two decades and includes clinical management consulting education and performance and strength conditioning his expertise lies in combining manual therapy with threedimensional movement modalities to address the underlying causes of pain instead of simply treating symptoms adam presents internationally to rehabilitation and fitness professionals and practices as a partner in realpt located in downtown chicago he’s also
