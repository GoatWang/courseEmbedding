written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by

specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no

similar here’s some advice to help you down the path a little quicker it’s especially helpful if you have all the below in a nice tidy package with your application email to peglicensinggmailcom  start by telling us about your setting don’t go into much detail—just give us the gist of what it is so we can look for any red flags like it being too close to an existing setting or too graphicmature for our fans after that we like to see some sample text if you have new edges hindrances or setting rules  that’s a good place to start we can see your writing style and make sure you “get” our rules system it also gives us an indication of your ability to selfedit now you’ll likely have to spend a little money we want to see that your product will have professional production values we’re looking for representative art trade dress and layout art if you can’t afford your favorite wellknown artist at this point you might want to check out sites like wwwdeviantartcom there are lots of amazing artists out there who haven’t been discovered yet and may work with a new company layout and trade dress you should be doing your layout in indesign or quark if you don’t have that ability or have a friend with those skills you might try contacting a company like savage mojo who has done both art direction and layout for other companies we only need to see a few pages here—not a complete final product if you are thinking about converting existing game material from another system there are a few things to keep in mind a good conversion is not about a  tradeoff of this ability to that edge capture the feel of the setting not the mechanics each game system has an inherent philosophy and ours is fast furious fun if the rule doesn’t fit all three it needs to be fixed what happens next varies depending on your strengths and plans but these first  steps are pretty common for everyone if you have any questions contact peglicensinggmailcom   and thanks for keeping it savage  designing rules to be streamlined and clear for the user is harder than it might look on the surface look at the chase rules for example they’re a page long and quite simple when you read them but designing them took a long time and a lot of playtests they handle everything from a foot chase to battles between fleets of star cruisers and they work pretty well too even edges  hindrances are

combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and
