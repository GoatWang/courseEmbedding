andrew birmingham  all marketing is performance marketing says ashu garg general partner at foundation capital an investor with a long pedigree in advertising and marketing technology foundation capital’s bets include such wellknown businesses as adroll responsys acquired by oracle  and tubemogul which was subsequently acquired by adobe its most recent investment was made this month into tv analytics business conviva the company and garg are very well respected however it is fair to say that garg’s views on the relative merits of performance versus brand are not without controversy garg is more than happy to defend his position “there is nothing like pure branding unless you are talking about tv and even that will change in the next five years” ashu garg general partner foundation capital we interviewed garg in the company’s san mateo headquarters in preparation for a research piece we were developing for adroll on the merger of advertising technology and marketing technology download “the convergence of adtech and martech” the conversation quickly turned to the matter of measuring success and the orentiation of different brands when it comes to performance according to garg there are three different axes on which to assess the way a company might market one axis is scale and especially the number of customers a company has another is the level of engagement a brand has with its clients which in turn drives decisions about whether brands are are likely to be attracted to performancebased business models or more traditional licence or annuitybased models “if you are a retailer in finance then you are truly direct bc however if you are in cpg then you are unlikely to have direct customer contact you are more bbc the third bucket is true bb” the third axis is performance orientation he says many companies like to consider themselves performancefocused he says but the truth is more nuanced performanceoriented brands tends to be more sophisticated because they need to be due to the maturity of technology at the moment he suggests “they are much more likely to have inhouse expertise” says garg “saas is not like a selfdriving car that may be the vision but at the moment if you want to get the performance out of the software you need people who know how to turn the knobs and dials sophisticated perofrmance marketing organisations have those people” he also flags trouble ahead for some in the agency world saying that genuinely performancefocused marketers are more likely to want to control their own programmatic destiny “in fact by definition if you use an agency you are not a true performance marketer” about the author andrew birmingham is the director of the which digital intelligence unit which produced the convergence of adtech and
