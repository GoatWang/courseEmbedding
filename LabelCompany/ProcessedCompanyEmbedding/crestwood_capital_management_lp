its successful business plaintiff’s marks have become well known in the financial services community and are among plaintiff’s most valuable assets by virtue of the funds’ and plaintiff’s long and exclusive use of its trademarks and the goodwill that plaintiff has established in its trademarks and name plaintiff’s marks are strong trademarks entitled to a wide scope of protection defendant’s infringing activities in july twenty years after the funds began using the marks and six years after plaintiff’s first use in commerce of plaintiff’s marks in the united states defendant began using

plaintiff’s marks being identical to those used by defendant defendant like plaintiff provides services in the financial services industry specifically defendant markets itself as providing “alternative” financing to investors creating further confusion with plaintiff’s provision of investment advisory services in the “alternative investment” space plaintiff has experienced instances of actual confusion between plaintiff’s marks and the marks being used by defendant on multiple occasions plaintiff has been contacted erroneously by third parties seeking to reach defendant by way of example plaintiff received a phone call from an individual who appeared to be a borrower seeking to repay a loan from or arranged by defendant plaintiff also received an email from a company seeking to form a partnership with plaintiff to provide working capital to business owners plaintiff is not in the business of providing financing but defendant is in that business leading to the logical conclusion that clients and other third parties are confused by defendant’s use of plaintiff’s registered trademarks in an attempt to resolve defendant’s infringement without court intervention plaintiff has sent three letters to defendant and its counsel defendant’s counsel has responded to only the first letter true and correct copies of all correspondence exchanged by the parties to date

use of the “crestwood capital services” “crestwood” andcase cvpgg document  filed  page  of   “crestwood capital” marks is confusingly similar to plaintiff’s registered “crestwood” marks as
