questioned whether the stock market could grow that long board chairman william crist a former union president replied that they “could make all sorts of different assumptions and make predictions but

percent in multiasset class and other shareholder activism emphasized under dale hansons leadershipedit beginning in the s and especially in the early s under the pioneering leadership of ceo dale hanson calpers has used its influence as one of the largest shareholders in the world to change the way certain things are done in business it is especially known for its shareholder activism concerning corporate governance in which it has been described as the most influential pension fund and as a leader among activist institutions among other examples of its shareholder activism calpers has lobbied the board of general motors gm to take a more active role in monitoring the company which may have been a factor in the gm boards ousting chairman robert stempel in  demanded in  that us companies in its portfolio disclose their yk readiness starting in  screened all its investments in emerging markets for compliance with a number of human rights environmental and labor standards as

eisner as chairman of the board and ceo of the walt disney company eisner was removed as chairman of the board and in  resigned as ceo in  banned investment of its funds in nine companies that do business in sudan until the government of that country halts ongoing genocide however that decision was described as a largely symbolic gesture because calpers did not own a stake in any of the nine from september  through july participated as lead plaintiff in a successful classaction lawsuit against unitedhealth group for options backdating calpers had held  million shares of unitedhealth stock valued at  million in august  a federal judge in minnesota ordered unitedhealth to pay  million to settle the lawsuit furthermore former unitedhealth ceo william w mcguire would pay  million and relinquish options to buy  million unitedhealth shares another former executive would pay  with other institutional investors requested in  that the government set national mandatory standards to cut greenhouse gas emissions at apple in  calpers voted for a management proposal to implement majority voting for director elections and other proposals designed to enhance shareowner rights this was a result of more than two years of engagement with apple to change its voting standard for board candidates from a plurality model to a majority standard following successful calperssponsored shareowner resolutions supporting majority voting in february  apple sponsored proposal  which would amend apple’s charter to provide for majority voting for directors the proposal would also establish a par value for apple stock and eliminate apple’s ability to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval calpers strongly supported apple’s position that preferred stock should not be issued without shareowner approval while the  vote was canceled on a technicality majority voting was officially adopted in  at nabors industries in  calpers sponsored a proposal to amend the company’s bylaws to require shareowner approval of severance benefits that exceed  times the sum of an executive’s base salary and bonus calpers also voted for a proposal asking the board to elect an independent chair and for a proposal allowing shareowners to nominate candidates for election to the board calpers has received some criticism for its shareholder activism as of  there was a concern that calpers activism had distracted from its effectiveness as a corporate watchdog and its ability to provide for the  million public employees whose pensions it guarantees despite the efforts of calpers and others the chief counsel of tiaacref was quoted in  as saying that there has been no countrywide improvement in corporate governance calpers votes against some companies directors whose sins are exceedingly small such as attendance gaps or minor conflicts businesses describe calpers as having a prolabor agenda especially because of the dominance of democrats on calpers board some argue that calpers actions unduly interfere with business and encourage the belief that california is antibusiness the focus list and the calpers effectedit since  calpers has placed certain companies on a focus list each year the criteria for the focus list have changed over time but it currently includes companies for which calpers has concerns about stock and financial underperformance and corporate governance practices calpers works with these companies to improve their corporate governance and thereby improve their financial performance in  the focus list companies were the cheesecake factory hilb rogal  hobbs co invacare lazboy and standard pacific homes in  nesbitt published a study that found that companies on the focus list trailed the sp  prior to being put on the list but outperformed the sp  after being put on the list and named this phenomenon the calpers effect the term has been used in the newsmedia whether a calpers effect actually exists has been studied in a number of subsequent papers including but not limited to smith  determined that shareholder wealth increased for companies that adopted changes proposed by calpers or made changes that resulting in reaching a settlement with calpers however shareholder wealth decreased for companies that resisted calpers proposals wahal  analyzed the efficacy of pension fund activism for calpers and eight other funds such as tiaacref of the firms targeted by the nine funds only firms targeted by calpers experienced a positive stock price reaction crutchley et al  discovered that calpers less visible activism in  corresponded with less returns on stocks than in  when calpers activism was more aggressive two studies published by calpers staff ie anson et al in  found that stocks on the calpers focus list experience positive excess stock returns of about  over the three months following release of the list and an average oneyear cumulative excess return of  per cent english et al  concluded that calpers targeting produces a statistically significant improvement in shortterm returns but not necessarily in longterm returns depending on the specific methods used to calculate longterm returns nelson  claimed that his study addressed problems in the methodologies of previous studies eg by controlling for the contaminating events of wall street journal articles appearing just before or just after the dates that calpers released focus list information he found no evidence to support the persistence of a calpers effect after  barber  asserted that in his analyses calpers activism yields small but reliably positive market reactions in the short term in contrast although the longterm returns of companies are uniformly positive and economically large after being placed on the calpers focus list due to market volatility he could not conclude that the longterm returns were unusual barbers paper won a  prize for best study in the area of socially responsible investing from the haas school of business junkin and toth  in an update of nesbitts  study found that the calpers effect was still present in that the average targeted company produced excess returns of  above their respective benchmark return on a cumulative basis but that the effect had decreased over time calpers stopped posting a public focus list in  opting instead to engage underperforming public stock companies through private contacts and proxy actions some company engagements continue to become public information primarily through proxy actions and shareowner solicitations in  calpers initiated a program to monetize the focus list each year after the board approves staff recommendations for focus list companies calpers increases investments in those companies new focus list companies are added to the portfolio each year and the portfolio is rebalanced so that holdings remain equally weighted the purpose of monetizing the focus list is to replicate the wilshire studies—using actual funds to demon—strate and measure the “calpers effect” monetizing the focus list also allows calpers to realize a return on the increased value that typically occurs following an engagement as of the fiscal year ending june  the calpers portfolio had outperformed its ftse us large cap extobacco benchmark notable investmentsedit the agency both lost and gained from investments in enron which went bankrupt in  and its affiliated companies its losses included common stock worth  million stock in a different portfolio some bonds and a separate investment in new power co worth  million and  million from the liquidation of enrons jedi ii project ie calpers had paid  million for its stake but received only  million in return however as calpers had earned  million from the sale of its stake in enrons jedi i project to enrons chewco project its total enron losses were only about  million although calpers was alerted by its advisers in december  about the serious and potentially embarrassing conflicts inherent in one of a web of private partnerships set up by enrons chief financial officer andrew s fastow it later denied that it could have taken actions to prevent enrons downfall nevertheless as a result of the enron experience in  the calpers board did resolve to improve accounting and auditing standards among companies in which it invests in  the republican party questioned calpers investing  million in a firm that was cofounded by a democratic supporter calpers denied any political influence in its investment decision in  it was revealed that calpers had invested  million in venture capital funds of billionaire ronald burkle who had donated  million to democratic candidates and causes phil angelides denied that calpers made its decision because of the donations as of  calpers had invested  billion in underserved areas of california in  calpers evaluated emerging markets for evidence of political stability humane labor laws a fair and functional legal system and financial transparency on the basis of the evaluation calpers placed the philippines on probation for investment in  a consultants recommendation to remove the philippines from the approved list contributed to a  drop in the billion manila stock market by  calpers had given higher ratings to the philippines for which its president gloria macapagalarroyo personally expressed appreciation calpers has been criticized for being foolish to invest in collateralized debt obligations cdos before the july  mortgage meltdown and for not publicly addressing the issue in june  after los angelesarea property developer landsource filed for bankruptcy protection calpers was criticized for having invested  million in landsource in  a calpers spokesperson described the investment as small relative to calpers total assets studies commissioned by calpers on its economic impactsedit calpers commissioned three studies that were released in  about the economic impacts of the following calpers retirement benefits payments prepared by california state university sacramento and released in april  this study found that the direct payments of  billion in  led to a total impact including the ripple effect of business and government revenues as spending from benefit checks works its way through the economy of  billion calpers investments prepared by california state university sacramento and released in september  this study found that the direct investments of  billion in  led to a total impact of  billion calpers health care benefits payments prepared by lincoln crow benefits research group and released in april  this study found that the direct payments of  billion in  led to a total impact of  billion key findings of the calpers economic impacts in california report for the fiscal year ending june   included calpers benefits retirees spending their pensions returned  in economic activity to california for each taxpayer dollar public funds contributed to the system the total economic revenue generated by calpers benefits was more than  billion calpers benefits created  jobs throughout california investments in california accounted for  billion or approximately  percent of the calpers portfolio the calpers investment portfolio which included public and private equities real estate fixed income and infrastructure supported  million jobs calpers touted the studies as demonstrating the value of the agency with news releases such as calpers and calstrs pensions power up state and local economies the studies and their use by calpers were criticized as follows a reporter summarized the opinion of the lead author of the first study as his study was never intended as any sort of implied commentary on the wisdom of calpers policies if the money that calpers paid in benefits were returned to taxpayers the money would be spent and would therefore still cause ripple effects the economic impact might be the same if a private investment firm managed the funds portfolio employee recognition programedit among other offerings to ensure its workers are happy as well as healthy calpers has an onsite montessori method child care facility conducts employee surveys every two years offers a training and wellness program and administers a nationally known employee recognition program the employee recognition program has several components

practices award from naer the employee recognition program was reported to contribute to high employee satisfaction and a low employee turnover rate at calpers contributionsedit member contributionsedit calpers members contribute a percentage of their salary throughout their active membership member contribution rates are set by statute and can vary by membership category miscellaneous or safety and by benefit formula member contribution rates can change based on legislative law changes however the rise and fall of the contribution percentages does not affect memberaccrued retirement benefits which are guaranteed by law the percentage contributed above the monthly compensation breakpoint depends upon the benefit formula as shown in the “employee contributions” subsection of the summary of plan provisions in appendix b of each public agency state and schools annual valuation report with the passage of assembly bill  ab  the pension reform legislation by the california legislature calpers members hired after january   are expected to pay  percent of the total normal cost of the benefit plan in which they participate employer contributionsedit on average schools and other public agencies contribute  of payroll for their employees retirement benefits however the rates can increase if calpers investments perform unfavorably and decrease if calpers investments perform favorably according to calpers the school pool contribution rate is affected by the investment return of a given fiscal year in the second year that follows and local public agency contribution rates are affected by the investment return of a given fiscal year in the third fiscal year that follows calpers earnings and losses are averaged over  years to prevent extreme changes in employers contribution rates nevertheless in  calpers warned that it might ask for more money from the state starting in july  and from localgovernment employers starting in july  if calpers investments are performing poorly as of june   employers’ contributions and stated unfunded liabilities are calculated using actuarial present value which assumes the fund will continually grow at  however if an employer seeks to leave calpers it will be required to immediately payoff the undisclosed current market value of the unfunded liabilities which only assumes  growth at a  legislative hearing governor jerry brown called calpers asserted reliance on bringing in new members “a ponzi scheme” after the financial crisis of  many cities in california came under financial stress due to a combination of factors which led to three highprofile municipal bankruptcy filings by vallejo stockton and san bernardino that received nationwide attention during the proceedings some creditors accused calperss increased postcrisis employer payments and future unfunded liabilities as a cause of insolvency and sought to have calpers employer contributions reduced this was vigorouslyclarification needed opposed by calpers according to  state figures the calpers system is  funded with unfunded future liabilities of  billion nongovernment estimates show a larger shortfall benefitsedit calpers provides benefits to all state government employees and by contract to local agency and school employees calpers administers the following categories of benefits to members retirement benefits under defined benefit plans deferred compensation and other supplemental income plans disability retirement and industrial disability retirement death benefits health benefits longterm care benefits retirement benefits under defined benefit plansedit as of may  calpers paid monthly allowances to  retirees survivors and beneficiaries in the year ending  calpers paid in  billion in benefits the retirement benefits are calculated using a members years of service credit age at retirement and final compensation average salary for a defined period of employment and the retirement formulas are determined by the members employer state school or local public agency occupation miscellaneous general office and others safety industrial or peace officerfirefighter and the specific provisions in the contract between calpers and the employer in addition calpers administers the legislators retirement system judges retirement system and judges retirement system ii besides calpers california has a number of other public retirement systems including at least  counties alameda contra costa fresno imperial kern los angeles marin mendocino merced orange sacramento san bernardino san diego san francisco county as well as city san joaquin san luis obispo san mateo santa barbara sonoma stanislaus tulare and ventura at least  cities concord fresno los angeles san diego san francisco also a county and san jose the university of california the california state teachers retirement system calstrs calpers has reciprocity agreements with many of these california public retirement systems that allow retirees with service credit and contributions in two systems to receive payments from both systems some people prefer defined contribution plans to calpers defined benefit plan for example in  howard kaloogian sponsored a bill in the state assembly to allow state employees to choose between calpers defined benefit plan and a defined contribution plan the bill failed in a state senate committee in early  governor arnold schwarzenegger proposed a ballot initiative to require new public employees to join a klike plan but dropped the proposal after opposition to a provision in the initiative to reduce benefits for widows of officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty in november  the voters of the city of pacific grove passed an advisory measure to leave calpers in favor of a defined contribution plan among other arguments calpers claims that defined contribution plans cost more to manage than defined benefit plans and fail to provide adequate funds to retirees deferred compensation and other supplemental income plansedit calpers is responsible for a deferred compensation retirement plan  plan and two other plans to supplement income after retirement or permanent separation from state employment as of december  the calpers  plan serves  participants and had  billion in assets the peace officers  firefighters defined contribution plan had  participants and  million in assetsfunded by a state contribution of  of base pay a memberfunded supplemental contributions program for  participants had  million in assets disability retirement and industrial disability retirementedit calpers offers two types of retirement benefits if a worker is disabled in industrial disability retirement the disability is due to a jobrelated injury or illness in contrast disability retirement implies that the disability was not necessarily caused by employment the specific benefits vary by employer by the contract between calpers and the employer and by the employees occupation two major controversies have affected calpers disability retirement and industrial disability retirement program over the years first in the mids and again in the mids there were concerns about inappropriate industrial disability retirement for public safety personnel including some nondisabled persons fraudulently claim industrial disability retirement such as a disabled highway patrol officer riding in a rodeo unfortunately state law forbids calpers from requiring disabled retirees who are  or older to submit to another medical evaluation even if there is evidence of possible fraud a series of bills that expanded eligibility for these medical pensions  and made it easier to get them increased costs for state and local governments the list of disabilities automatically presumed to be jobrelated for publicsafety workers has grown to include diseases and conditions that may or may not be caused by employment such as lower back pain heart disease cancer syphilis hiv and mad cow disease retirees can receive two safety disability retirements for the same condition if they are covered by two separate pension systems because california law prevents lightduty assignments in the california highway patrol some officers are forced to retire against their will second a  state law that tied public safety officers disability benefits to the age at which they were hired caused an age discrimination complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc in  which eventually led to a  class action lawsuit against calpers and other state and local agencies in january  calpers settled the suit by agreeing to pay  million in retroactive benefits and  million in future benefits to  officers the settlement was by far the largest in the eeocs history furthermore calpers agreed to not use an agebased formula in the future which basically nullified the  state law death benefitsedit if a calpers member dies before retirement calpers may provide death benefits to certain beneficiaries the benefits can include onetime payments andor monthly payments but depend on the members age years of service job classification employers contract with calpers eligible beneficiary date of separation from employment and whether or not they were eligible to retire at the time of death california employers’ retiree benefit trust fundedit the california employers’ retiree benefit trust fund was established by calpers in march  to provide california public agencies with a costefficient professionally managed investment vehicle for prefunding other postemployment benefits opeb such as retiree health benefits prefunding reduces an agency’s longterm opeb liability participating agencies can use investment earnings to pay future opeb liabilities similar to the calpers pension fund in which three out of four dollars paid in retirement benefits come from investment earnings health benefitsedit in  the meyergeddes hospital and medical health care act was passed which led to sers offering health insurance for state employees beginning in  after the health maintenance organization hmo act of  pers began to deal with hmos to create more unified and standardized health care benefit rates in  the meyergeddes act was renamed the public employees medical and hospital care act by the early s calpers received national attention for its attempt at implementing managed competition which is the theory that health care costs can be controlled by forcing health providers to compete with one another under government supervision as of  calpers contracted with  health plans for its over  members and was able to reduce health insurance premiums by  compared with  at the time calpers was called a model for the socalled health alliances proposed in the  clinton health care plan rates continued to decline by  in  and  in  but rose by  in  and  in  calpers attracted national attention again in the mids this time for health maintenance organization rate increases of  in  and  in  meanwhile the number of participating plans dropped to seven as of  and more than two dozen cities counties and school districts representing  of membership left calpers as of  because of high medical insurance rates a  study by the government accountability office determined that from  through  the average annual growth in calpers premiums  was lower than that of the federal employees health benefits program fehbp  and of other surveyed employersponsored health benefit programs  however between  and  the average annual growth rate in calpers premiums  was higher than that of fehbp  and of other surveyed employersponsored health benefit programs  as of  calpers eliminated copayments for preventive care visits raised copayments for other types of office visits and took other measures in an attempt to reduce costs in  blue shield of california dignity health and hill physicians medical group initiated an integrated health management program similar to an accountable care organization that covered  calpers members in  calpers provided more than  billion in health benefits for nearly  million active and retired state local government and school employees and their family members therefore it was the nation’s second largest public purchaser of health benefits behind the fehbp which covered about  million federal employees retirees and their dependents of the enrollees  are state employees and  are local government and school employees  are working and  are retired enrollees can join three types of plans  are enrolled in health maintenance organization plans administered by blue shield of california and by kaiser permanente  are enrolled in preferred
