formation of the tank destroyer force a suitable vehicle was needed to equip the new battalions by november  the army requested a vehicle with a gun in a fully rotating turret after other interim models were criticized for being too poorly designed the prototype of the m was conceived in early  being delivered in april of that year after appropriate changes to the hull and turret were made the modified version was selected for production in june  as the inch gun motor carriage m it mounted a inch  mm gun m in a rotating turret on a modified ma sherman tank chassis an alternate model the ma which used the chassis of an ma sherman tank was also produced production of the two models ran from september  to december  and october  to november  respectively the m was numerically the most important us tank destroyer of world war ii it combined thin but sloped armor with the m shermans reliable drivetrain and a reasonably potent antitank weapon mounted in an opentopped turret despite its obsolescence in the face of more powerful german tanks like the panther and the introduction of more powerful and betterdesigned types as replacements the m remained in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar invention unlike other vehicles such as the m sherman m stuart or m priest the m was never assigned a nickname or referred to with one when used by american soldiers they simply called it a td a nickname for any tank destroyer in general beyond its formal designation contents  doctrine  development  design  production  armament  primary  secondary  combat use  united states army  british army  free french army  red army  israel  egypt  combat performance  variants  users  see also  references  notes  citations  sources  external links doctrineedit us combined arms doctrine on the eve of world war ii held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas separate ghq tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemys vulnerable rear areas us tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack but the mission of destroying massed enemy armored thrusts was assigned to a new branch the tank destroyer force tank destroyer units were meant to counter german blitzkrieg tactics tank destroyer units were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited to destroy enemy tanks this led to a requirement for very fast wellarmed vehicles though equipped with turrets unlike most selfpropelled antitank guns of the day the typical american design was more heavily gunned but more lightly armored and thus more maneuverable than a contemporary tank the idea was to use speed and agility as a defense rather than thick armor to bring a powerful selfpropelled gun into action against enemy tanks developmentedit after the formation of the tank destroyer tactical and firing center at camp hood texas in november  the army began testing to standardize on a configuration for the new tank destroyer battalions the tank destroyer board began to examine several hundred ordnance department prototype proposals for a tank destroyer mounting a inch gun initially focusing the most interest on two the t developed beginning in  and standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in january  it was a modified cleveland tractor company airfield towing tractor mounting a inch gun t in a limitedtraverse mounting a the t developed beginning in october  the t was initially rejected as being too tall and the t was its improved derivative the t was standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in may  it was an m lee chassis mounting a inch gun m in a limitedtraverse mounting b meanwhile as the final design developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers from january to june   ma vehicles were subsequently converted to m prime movers by removing the turret and adding the necessary equipment for them to tow the inch gun m and  mm howitzer m m shown in mass production at general motors tank

the m gun weighed  pounds the gunner stood or sat on the left side of the gun and aimed it using the m or mg telescope an ma panoramic telescope was also provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use the m carried  rounds of inch ammunition  of which were stowed in four racks in the sponsons and  rounds in the upper rear of the turret for combat use the inch gun m could fire five

numbers beginning in september  was capable of penetrating  mm of homogeneous armor angled at  degrees from the vertical at  yards this shot featured a subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation grenades five smoke grenades and two thermite grenades combat useedit m in action near saintlô june  m of the st tank destroyer battalion advances along a mountain road in italy  march  united states armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to british tank brigades equipped with churchill tanks armed with the general purpose  mm gun just as were british  pounder conversions in spm m conversions to pdr month conversions may   june   july   august   september   october

germany during the liberation of paris in august  a single m of general leclercs nd armored division named “sirocco” disabled a panther in the place de la concorde french ms also saw action on the frenchgerman border around strasbourg and in southern germany the free french first army led by general de lattre received some when they were a part of the sixth united states army group french ms were operated along similar lines as us tank destroyer units although initially with five vehicles per platoon instead of four red armyedit approximately  ms were supplied to the soviet union through

on the rd belorussian front in  taking part in summer campaigns in belorussia the baltic and east prussia the th selfpropelled artillery regiment was part of the th tank corps nd tank army it fought in belorussia and poland in  israeledit israel bought ms from scrapyards and dumping grounds in europe after  the first batch arrived in  being in very bad shape some years later as the ms guns were worn out israel decided to install pounder guns and also french highvelocity  mm cn  guns that had just been bought the ms were repaired and entered service in  after the  war they received the diesel engines of captured egyptian sherman tanks it is believed that israel also bought ms from france and may have captured several from egypt there is no report that the modified ms were used by the israelis in combat they were withdrawn from service by   egyptedit the egyptian army had a small number of exbritish ms inch and pdr versions and used them in  against israel israel captured some of them combat performanceedit the ms opentopped turret left the crew vulnerable to artillery and mortar fire and fragments the rd tank destroyer battalion took many casualties from artillery fire and tree bursts and lost  of  ms during the battle of the hürtgen forest the crew was also exposed to sniper fire and infantry close assault such as grenades thrown through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to use a hand crank to rotate the turret it took approximately  seconds to rotate a full  degrees total m losses in the european theater of operations to all causes were  m strength and losses in the eto month m strength m losses june    july

into world war ii and the formation of the tank destroyer force a suitable vehicle was needed to equip the new battalions by november  the army requested a vehicle with a gun in a fully rotating turret after other interim models were criticized for being too poorly designed the prototype of the m was conceived in early  being delivered in april of that year after appropriate changes to the hull and turret were made the modified version was selected for production in june  as the inch gun motor carriage m it mounted a inch  mm gun m in a rotating turret on a modified ma sherman tank chassis an alternate model the ma which used the chassis of an ma sherman tank was also produced production of the two models ran from september  to december  and october  to november  respectively the m was numerically the most important us tank destroyer of world war ii it combined thin but sloped armor with the m shermans reliable drivetrain and a reasonably potent antitank weapon mounted in an opentopped turret despite its obsolescence in the face of more powerful german tanks like the panther and the introduction of more powerful and betterdesigned types as replacements the m remained in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar invention unlike other vehicles such as the m sherman m stuart or m priest the m was never assigned a nickname or referred to with one when used by american soldiers they simply called it a td a nickname for any tank destroyer in general beyond its formal designation contents  doctrine  development  design  production  armament  primary  secondary  combat use  united states army  british army  free french army  red army  israel  egypt  combat performance  variants  users  see also  references  notes  citations  sources  external links doctrineedit us combined arms doctrine on the eve of world war ii held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas separate ghq tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemys vulnerable rear areas us tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack but the mission of destroying massed enemy armored thrusts was assigned to a new branch the tank destroyer force tank destroyer units were meant to counter german blitzkrieg tactics tank destroyer units were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited to destroy enemy tanks this led to a requirement for very fast wellarmed vehicles though equipped with turrets unlike most selfpropelled antitank guns of the day the typical american design was more heavily gunned but more lightly armored and thus more maneuverable than a contemporary tank the idea was to use speed and agility as a defense rather than thick armor to bring a powerful selfpropelled gun into action against enemy tanks developmentedit after the formation of the tank destroyer tactical and firing center at camp hood texas in november  the army began testing to standardize on a configuration for the new tank destroyer battalions the tank destroyer board began to examine several hundred ordnance department prototype proposals for a tank destroyer mounting a inch gun initially focusing the most interest on two the t developed beginning in  and standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in january  it was a modified cleveland tractor company airfield towing tractor mounting a inch gun t in a limitedtraverse mounting a the t developed beginning in october  the t was initially rejected as being too tall and the t was its improved derivative the t was standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in may  it was an m lee chassis mounting a inch gun m in a limitedtraverse mounting b meanwhile as the final design developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers from january to june   ma vehicles were subsequently converted to m prime movers by removing the turret and adding the necessary equipment for them to tow the inch gun m and  mm howitzer m m shown in

turret mounting the inch gun m in the m mount the m gun weighed  pounds the gunner stood or sat on the left side of the gun and aimed it using the m or mg telescope an ma panoramic telescope was also provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use the m carried  rounds of inch ammunition  of which were stowed in four racks in the sponsons and  rounds in the upper rear of the turret

t m hvap shot that saw action in small numbers beginning in september  was capable of penetrating  mm of homogeneous armor angled at  degrees from the vertical at  yards this shot featured a subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation grenades five smoke grenades and two thermite grenades combat useedit m in action near saintlô june  m of the st tank destroyer battalion advances along a mountain road in italy  march  united states armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to british tank brigades equipped with churchill tanks armed with the general purpose  mm gun just as were british  pounder conversions in spm m conversions to pdr month conversions may   june   july

in italy then in france and germany during the liberation of paris in august  a single m of general leclercs nd armored division named “sirocco” disabled a panther in the place de la concorde french ms also saw action on the frenchgerman border around strasbourg and in southern germany the free french first army led by general de lattre received some when they were a part of the sixth united states army group french ms were operated along similar lines as us tank destroyer units although initially with five vehicles per platoon instead of four red armyedit approximately  ms were supplied

years later as the ms guns were worn out israel decided to install pounder guns and also french highvelocity  mm cn  guns that had just been bought the ms were repaired and entered service in  after the  war they received the diesel engines of captured egyptian sherman tanks it is believed that israel also bought ms from france and may have captured several from egypt there is no report that the modified ms were used by the israelis in combat they were withdrawn from service by   egyptedit the egyptian army had a small number of exbritish ms inch and pdr versions and used them in  against israel israel captured some of them combat performanceedit the ms opentopped turret left the crew vulnerable to artillery and mortar fire and fragments the rd tank destroyer battalion took many casualties from artillery fire and tree bursts and lost  of  ms during the battle of the hürtgen forest the crew was also exposed to sniper fire and infantry close assault such as grenades thrown through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to use a hand crank to rotate the turret it took approximately  seconds to rotate a full  degrees total m losses in the european theater of operations to all causes were  m strength and losses in the eto

into world war ii and the formation of the tank destroyer force a suitable vehicle was needed to equip the new battalions by november  the army requested a vehicle with a gun in a fully rotating turret after other interim models were criticized for being too poorly designed the prototype of the m was conceived in early  being delivered in april of that year after appropriate changes to the hull and turret were made the modified version was selected for production in june  as the inch gun motor carriage m it mounted a inch  mm gun m in a rotating turret on a modified ma sherman tank chassis an alternate model the ma which used the chassis of an ma sherman tank was also produced production of the two models ran from september  to december  and october  to november  respectively the m was numerically the most important us tank destroyer of world war ii it combined thin but sloped armor with the m shermans reliable drivetrain and a reasonably potent antitank weapon mounted in an opentopped turret despite its obsolescence in the face of more powerful german tanks like the panther and the introduction of more powerful and betterdesigned types as replacements the m remained in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar invention unlike other vehicles such as the m sherman m stuart or m priest the m was never assigned a nickname or referred to with one when used by american soldiers they simply called it a td a nickname for any tank destroyer in general beyond its formal designation contents  doctrine  development  design  production  armament  primary  secondary  combat use  united states army  british army  free french army  red army  israel  egypt  combat performance  variants  users  see also  references  notes  citations  sources  external links doctrineedit us combined arms doctrine on the eve of world war ii held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas separate ghq tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemys vulnerable rear areas us tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack but the mission of destroying massed enemy armored thrusts was assigned to a new branch the tank destroyer force tank destroyer units were meant to counter german blitzkrieg tactics tank destroyer units were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited to destroy enemy tanks this led to a requirement for very fast wellarmed vehicles though equipped with turrets unlike most selfpropelled antitank guns of the day the typical american design was more heavily gunned but more lightly armored and thus more maneuverable than a contemporary tank the idea was to use speed and agility as a defense rather than thick armor to bring a powerful selfpropelled gun into action against enemy tanks developmentedit after the formation of the tank destroyer tactical and firing center at camp hood texas in november  the army began testing to standardize on a configuration for the new tank destroyer battalions the tank destroyer board began to examine several hundred ordnance department prototype proposals for a tank destroyer mounting a inch gun initially focusing the most interest on two the t developed beginning in  and standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in january  it was a modified cleveland tractor company airfield towing tractor mounting a inch gun t in a limitedtraverse mounting a the t developed beginning in october  the t was initially rejected as being too tall and the t was its improved derivative the t was standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in may  it was an m lee chassis mounting a inch gun m in a limitedtraverse mounting b meanwhile as the final design developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers from january to june   ma vehicles were subsequently converted to m prime movers by removing the turret and adding the necessary equipment for them to tow the inch gun m and  mm howitzer m m shown in

turret mounting the inch gun m in the m mount the m gun weighed  pounds the gunner stood or sat on the left side of the gun and aimed it using the m or mg telescope an ma panoramic telescope was also provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use the m carried  rounds of inch ammunition  of which were stowed in four racks in the sponsons and  rounds in the upper rear of the turret

t m hvap shot that saw action in small numbers beginning in september  was capable of penetrating  mm of homogeneous armor angled at  degrees from the vertical at  yards this shot featured a subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation grenades five smoke grenades and two thermite grenades combat useedit m in action near saintlô june  m of the st tank destroyer battalion advances along a mountain road in italy  march  united states armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to british tank brigades equipped with churchill tanks armed with the general purpose  mm gun just as were british  pounder conversions in spm m conversions to pdr month conversions may   june   july

in italy then in france and germany during the liberation of paris in august  a single m of general leclercs nd armored division named “sirocco” disabled a panther in the place de la concorde french ms also saw action on the frenchgerman border around strasbourg and in southern germany the free french first army led by general de lattre received some when they were a part of the sixth united states army group french ms were operated along similar lines as us tank destroyer units although initially with five vehicles per platoon instead of four red armyedit approximately  ms were supplied

tank army this unit served on the rd belorussian front in  taking part in summer campaigns in belorussia the baltic and east prussia the th selfpropelled artillery regiment was part of the th tank corps nd tank army it fought in belorussia and poland in  israeledit israel bought ms from scrapyards and dumping grounds in europe after  the first batch arrived in  being in very bad shape some years later as the ms guns were worn out israel decided to install pounder guns and also french highvelocity  mm cn  guns that had just been bought the ms were repaired and entered service in  after the  war they received the diesel engines of captured egyptian sherman tanks it is believed that israel also bought ms from france and may have captured several from egypt there is no report that the modified ms were used by the israelis in combat they were withdrawn from service by   egyptedit the egyptian army had a small number of exbritish ms inch and pdr versions and used them in  against israel israel captured some of them combat performanceedit the ms opentopped turret left the crew vulnerable to artillery and mortar fire and fragments the rd tank destroyer battalion took many casualties from artillery fire and tree bursts and lost  of  ms during the battle of the hürtgen forest the crew was also exposed to sniper fire and infantry close assault such as grenades thrown through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to use a hand crank to rotate the turret it took approximately  seconds to rotate a full  degrees total m losses in the european theater of operations to all causes were  m strength and losses in the eto

into world war ii and the formation of the tank destroyer force a suitable vehicle was needed to equip the new battalions by november  the army requested a vehicle with a gun in a fully rotating turret after other interim models were criticized for being too poorly designed the prototype of the m was conceived in early  being delivered in april of that year after appropriate changes to the hull and turret were made the modified version was selected for production in june  as the inch gun motor carriage m it mounted a inch  mm gun m in a rotating turret on a modified ma sherman tank chassis an alternate model the ma which used the chassis of an ma sherman tank was also produced production of the two models ran from september  to december  and october  to november  respectively the m was numerically the most important us tank destroyer of world war ii it combined thin but sloped armor with the m shermans reliable drivetrain and a reasonably potent antitank weapon mounted in an opentopped turret despite its obsolescence in the face of more powerful german tanks like the panther and the introduction of more powerful and betterdesigned types as replacements the m remained in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar invention unlike other vehicles such as the m sherman m stuart or m priest the m was never assigned a nickname or referred to with one when used by american soldiers they simply called it a td a

 free french army  red army  israel  egypt  combat performance  variants  users  see also  references  notes  citations  sources  external links doctrineedit us combined arms doctrine on the eve of world war ii held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas separate ghq tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemys vulnerable rear areas us tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack but the mission of destroying massed enemy armored thrusts was assigned to a new branch the tank destroyer force tank destroyer units were meant to counter german blitzkrieg tactics tank destroyer units were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited to destroy enemy tanks this led to a requirement for very fast wellarmed vehicles though equipped with turrets unlike most selfpropelled antitank guns of the day the typical american design was more heavily gunned but more lightly armored and thus more maneuverable than a contemporary tank the idea was to use speed and agility as a defense rather than thick armor to bring a powerful selfpropelled gun into action against enemy tanks developmentedit after the formation of the tank destroyer tactical and firing center at camp hood texas in november  the army began testing to standardize on a configuration for the new tank destroyer battalions the tank destroyer board began to examine several hundred ordnance department prototype proposals for a tank destroyer mounting a inch gun initially focusing the most interest on two the t developed beginning in  and standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in january  it was a modified cleveland tractor company airfield towing tractor mounting a inch gun t in a limitedtraverse mounting a the t developed beginning in october  the t was initially rejected as being too tall and the t was its improved derivative the t was standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in may  it was an m lee chassis mounting a inch gun m in a limitedtraverse mounting b meanwhile as the final design developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers from january to june   ma vehicles were subsequently converted to m prime movers by removing the turret and adding the necessary equipment for them to tow the inch gun m and  mm howitzer m m shown in

turret mounting the inch gun m in the m mount the m gun weighed  pounds the gunner stood or sat on the left side of the gun and aimed it using the m or mg telescope an ma panoramic telescope was also provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use the m carried  rounds of inch ammunition  of which were stowed in four racks in the sponsons and  rounds in the upper rear of the turret

t m hvap shot that saw action in small numbers beginning in september  was capable of penetrating  mm of homogeneous armor angled at  degrees from the vertical at  yards this shot featured a subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation grenades five smoke grenades and two thermite grenades combat useedit m in action near saintlô june  m of the st tank destroyer battalion advances along a mountain road in italy  march  united states armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to british tank brigades equipped with churchill tanks armed with the general purpose  mm gun just as were british  pounder conversions in spm m conversions to pdr month conversions may   june   july

in italy then in france and germany during the liberation of paris in august  a single m of general leclercs nd armored division named “sirocco” disabled a panther in the place de la concorde french ms also saw action on the frenchgerman border around strasbourg and in southern germany the free french first army led by general de lattre received some when they were a part of the sixth united

years later as the ms guns were worn out israel decided to install pounder guns and also french highvelocity  mm cn  guns that had just been bought the ms were repaired and entered service in  after the  war they received the diesel engines of captured egyptian sherman tanks it is believed that israel also bought ms from france and may have captured several from egypt there is no report that the modified ms were used by the israelis in combat they were withdrawn from service by   egyptedit the egyptian army had a small number of exbritish ms inch and pdr versions and used them in  against israel israel captured some of them combat performanceedit the ms opentopped turret left the crew vulnerable to artillery and mortar fire and fragments the rd tank destroyer battalion took many casualties from artillery fire and tree bursts and lost  of  ms during the battle of the hürtgen forest the crew was also exposed to sniper fire and infantry close assault such as grenades thrown through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to use a hand crank to rotate the turret it took approximately  seconds to rotate a full  degrees total m losses in the european theater of operations to all causes were  m strength and losses in the eto

in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar invention unlike other vehicles such as the m sherman m stuart or m priest the m was never assigned a nickname or referred to with one when used by american soldiers they simply called it a td a

world war ii held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas separate ghq tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemys vulnerable rear areas us tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack but the mission of destroying massed enemy armored thrusts was assigned to a new branch the tank destroyer force tank destroyer units were meant to counter german blitzkrieg tactics tank destroyer units were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited to destroy enemy tanks this led to a requirement for very fast wellarmed vehicles though equipped with turrets unlike most selfpropelled antitank guns of the day the typical american design was more heavily gunned but more lightly armored and thus more maneuverable than a contemporary tank the idea was to use speed and agility as a defense rather than thick armor to bring a powerful selfpropelled gun into action against enemy tanks developmentedit after the formation of the tank destroyer tactical and firing center at camp hood texas in november  the army began testing to standardize on a configuration for the new tank destroyer battalions the tank destroyer board began to examine several hundred ordnance department prototype proposals for a tank destroyer mounting a inch gun initially focusing the most interest on two the t developed beginning in  and standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in january  it was a modified cleveland tractor company airfield towing tractor mounting a inch gun t in a limitedtraverse mounting a the t developed beginning in october  the t was initially rejected as being too tall and the t was its improved derivative the t was standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in may  it was an m lee chassis mounting a inch gun m in a limitedtraverse mounting b meanwhile as the final design developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers from january to june   ma vehicles were subsequently converted to m prime movers by removing the turret and adding the necessary equipment for them to tow the inch gun m and  mm howitzer m m shown in

provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use the m carried  rounds of inch ammunition  of which were stowed in four racks in the sponsons and  rounds in the upper rear of the turret

subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation

armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to british tank brigades equipped with churchill tanks armed with the general purpose  mm gun just as were british  pounder conversions in spm m conversions to pdr month conversions may   june   july

through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to

into world war ii and the formation of the tank destroyer force a suitable vehicle was needed to equip the new battalions by november  the army requested a vehicle with a gun in a fully rotating turret after other interim models were criticized for being too poorly designed the prototype of the m was conceived in early  being delivered in april of that year after appropriate changes to the hull and turret were made the modified version was selected for production in june  as the inch gun motor carriage m it mounted a inch  mm gun m in a rotating turret on a modified ma sherman tank chassis an alternate model the ma which used the chassis of an ma sherman tank was also produced production of the two models ran from september  to december  and october  to november  respectively the m was numerically the most important us tank destroyer of world war ii it combined thin but sloped armor with the m shermans reliable drivetrain and a reasonably potent antitank weapon mounted in an opentopped turret despite its obsolescence in the face of more powerful german tanks like the panther and the introduction of more powerful and betterdesigned types as replacements the m remained in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar

developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers

subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation grenades five smoke grenades and two thermite grenades combat useedit m in action near saintlô june  m of the st tank destroyer battalion advances along a mountain road in italy  march  united states armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to

through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to

into world war ii and the formation of the tank destroyer force a suitable vehicle was needed to equip the new battalions by november  the army requested a vehicle with a gun in a fully rotating turret after other interim models were criticized for being too poorly designed the prototype of the m was conceived in early  being delivered in april of that year after appropriate changes to the hull and turret were made the modified version was selected for production in june  as the inch gun motor carriage m it mounted a inch  mm gun m in a rotating turret on a modified ma sherman tank chassis an alternate model the ma which used the chassis of an ma sherman tank was also produced production of the two models ran from september  to december  and october  to november  respectively the m was numerically the most important us tank destroyer of world war ii it combined thin but sloped armor with the m shermans reliable drivetrain and a reasonably potent antitank weapon mounted in an opentopped turret despite its obsolescence in the face of more powerful german tanks like the panther and the introduction of more powerful and betterdesigned types as replacements the m remained in service until the end of the war during world war ii the primary user of the m tank destroyer was the united states but many were lendleased to the united kingdom and free french forces several dozen were also sent to the soviet union postwar the m was given as military surplus to several countries such as belgium denmark and the netherlands through the mutual defense assistance act or acquired through other means by countries like israel and the republic of china the m is often referred to by the nickname wolverine but the origin of this nickname is unknown it is possibly a postwar invention unlike other vehicles such as the m sherman m stuart or m priest the m was never assigned a nickname or referred to with one when used by american soldiers they simply called it a td a

 free french army  red army  israel  egypt  combat performance  variants  users  see also  references  notes  citations  sources  external links doctrineedit us combined arms doctrine on the eve of world war ii held that tanks should be designed to fulfill the role of forcing a breakthrough into enemy rear areas separate ghq tank battalions would support infantry in destroying fixed enemy defenses and armored divisions would then exploit the breakthrough to rush into the enemys vulnerable rear areas us tanks were expected to fight any hostile tanks they encountered in their attack but the mission of destroying massed enemy armored thrusts was assigned to a new branch the tank destroyer force tank destroyer units were meant to counter german blitzkrieg tactics tank destroyer units were to be held as a reserve at the corps or army level and were to move quickly to the site of any massed enemy tank breakthrough maneuvering aggressively and using ambush tactics charging or chasing enemy tanks was explicitly prohibited to destroy enemy tanks this led to a requirement for very fast wellarmed vehicles though equipped with turrets unlike most selfpropelled antitank guns of the day the typical american design was more heavily gunned but more lightly armored and thus more maneuverable than a contemporary tank the idea was to use speed and agility as a defense rather than thick armor to bring a powerful selfpropelled gun into action against enemy tanks developmentedit after the formation of the tank destroyer tactical and firing center at camp hood texas in november  the army began testing to standardize on a configuration for the new tank destroyer battalions the tank destroyer board began to examine several hundred ordnance department prototype proposals for a tank destroyer mounting a inch gun initially focusing the most interest on two the t developed beginning in  and standardized as the m inch gun motor carriage in january  it was a modified cleveland tractor company airfield towing tractor mounting a inch gun t in a limitedtraverse mounting a the t developed beginning in october  the t was initially rejected as being too tall and the t was its

developments of these two tank destroyers were underway the ordnance department became dissatisfied and by november  had issued an additional specification for a tank destroyer with a inch gun in a rotating turret design work began immediately the inch gun motor carriage t combined an earlyproduction ma medium tank hull with the inch gun m from the m heavy tank in a cast circular opentopped turret using lessons learned from combat reports from the philippines the armor on the sides and rear of the upper hull was changed from flat to sloped plates this new test vehicle was designated the inch gun motor carriage te prototypes of these two vehicles were delivered to aberdeen proving ground in april  and the army selected the te for further development on may   the side and rear upper hull armor of the te was thinned from  inch  mm to  inches  mm in order to reduce the weight of the vehicle the staff at aberdeen proving ground was worried that the armor of the te was too thin and so bosses for appliqué armor panels were added to the hull sides glacis and turret sides as the cast turret was found to be difficult to manufacture the design of the turret was changed to a sloped pentagonal shape made of welded armor plate in june  the modified te was standardized as the inch gun motor carriage m by fall  with its m and m competitors being eliminated from the design competition and their production contracts cancelled the m was to become the united states primary tank destroyer of the early war period as there were fears that the production of ma chassis would be inadequate for m production an alternate design the inch gun motor carriage ma based on the ma medium tank chassis was also authorized for production designedit american tank destroyer doctrine emphasized speed and gun power over armor as a result the ms armor was thin which made it vulnerable to most german antitank weapons the thickness of the ms armor ranged from  to  inches  to  mm the lower hull being modified from that of a standard ma or ma sherman tank had  inch  mm thick armor on the sides and rear and an  inch  mm thick floor the rounded cast transmission cover was  inches  mm thick in a departure from its m sherman parent the m lacked the extra  inch  mm floor plate under the drivers and assistant drivers stations that provided them additional protection from mines the glacis plate was  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the sides and rear of the upper hull were  inches  mm thick sloped at  degrees from the vertical the rear upper hull plate was used for storage of the vehicles pioneer and maintenance tools a pound  kg axe a foot  m crowbar a mattock handle and head a doublesided pound  kg sledgehammer and a track tensioning wrench the sides and rear of the upper hull featured angled extensions or covers over the upper run of track these extensions often got in the way of fitting duckbill extended end connectors used to reduce ground pressure on soft ground and were often removed along with the front fenders by maintenance units the hull roof plate ranged from  in  mm thick over the drivers and assistant drivers stations and turret ring to  inches  mm thick over the engine compartment the manually rotated turret of the m was a pentagonal shape the sides were sloped  degrees inward from the vertical and were  inch  mm thick the rear of the turret was also  inch  mm thick the partial roof on the front third of the turret opening was  inches  mm thick the triangular cast gun shield sported the thickest armor on the vehicle  inches  mm it was sloped at  degrees from the vertical and horizontal the m and ma were mechanically identical except for their power plants the m used the general motors  consisting of two detroit diesel  inline engines mated to a common crankshaft the tandem engine produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm one advantage of the gm  was that the engines could be disconnected at will from the crankshaft and run independently if one of the engines was damaged or destroyed it could be disconnected and the other engine used to move the vehicle the engine of the ma was the ford gaa an cylinder derivative of an illfated v aircraft engine project it produced  horsepower  kw at  rpm when tested side by side in september  the ma was judged to have superior automotive performance to the m even though it produced only slightly less torque the mas engine was far lighter and used a common fuel like the rest of the armys vehicles gasoline by the time the test results were released in february  the army was committed to using the m overseas as a result the ma was kept in the united states for training the m and ma had a crew of five commander gunner loader driver and assistant driver the driver and assistant driver who also operated the vehicles radio were seated in the front hull and provided with periscopes the unique design of the hull hatches to clear the gun mantlet meant that the drivers view directly to the left side was obstructed he was provided with a second periscope at the edge of the hull for this purpose the commander gunner and loader were all located in the turret the commander sat on a folding seat at the right rear the gunner on the left side of the gun normally stood to operate it but he was also provided with a folding seat the loader normally stood in the area behind the gun a third folding seat was provided in the turret for the assistant driver in case he needed to assist the loader for any reason the m lacked an auxiliary generator which forced the crew to run the main engines in order to recharge the vehicles batteries the engine noise and smoke could attract enemy fire especially in close quarters where the m was vulnerable to due to its thin armor and opentopped turret the lack of an auxiliary generator was rectified with the introduction of the m tank destroyer productionedit soon after reaching production it was realized that the barrel of the inch gun m was too heavy to the point where it prevented traverse of the turret on a slope of more than four degrees as an attempt to improve the figure to fifteen degrees the army ordered that the track grousers and antiaircraft machine gun be stored on the rear of the turret this did not solve the balance problem and on  december  triangular quick fix turret counterweights made of lead mild steel or cast iron were authorized the mild steel parts weighed  pounds meanwhile a set of wedgeshaped counterweights weighing  pounds total was designed by fisher the wedgeshaped weights began to be added to new vehicles at fisher on  january  by late december  a second lock was added to the turret and a stirrupshaped gun cradle was added to the rear deck to secure the gun for travel since the track grousers could not be stored on the rear of the turret anymore grouser racks that could be attached to the appliqué armor bosses on the hull were added to vehicles beginning in early april  the m initially lacked any provision for indirect fire in may  an azimuth indicator and gunners quadrant were added to the m the grouser racks and indirect fire equipment were often retrofitted to earlier vehicles by late june  it was realized that fishers initial counterweights were too heavy two newly designed counterweights reduced the total weight to  pounds and better distributed the weight of the gun they resembled an upsidedown duck bill shape when viewed from the side to accommodate the new weights the design of the upper rear of the turret was changed from sloped inwards to nearly vertical in july  the appliqué armor bosses on the hull sides and turret were dropped from production the bosses on the glacis were retained in late september  a single m was tested with an oilgear hydraulic traversing motor that could traverse the turret even without the counterweights but this modification was not pursued as the production contracts were reaching their end production of  ms by the fisher body division of general motors at the fisher tank arsenal in grand blanc michigan ran from september  through december  ford motor company built  mas from october  until september  from september to november  fisher built the remaining  mas fisher also completed a further  ma hulls without turrets in january  for direct conversion to m tank destroyers from january to june   ma vehicles were subsequently converted to m prime movers by removing the turret and adding the necessary equipment for them to tow the inch gun m and  mm howitzer m m shown in

turret mounting the inch gun m in the m mount the m gun weighed  pounds the gunner stood or sat on the left side of the gun and aimed it using the m or mg telescope an ma panoramic telescope was also provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use the m carried  rounds of inch ammunition  of which were stowed in four racks in the sponsons and  rounds in the upper rear of the turret for combat use the inch gun m could fire five types of ammunition m apt shot mma apcbchet shell ma high explosive shell m hc b hexachloroethane smoke shell t m hvapt shot the m ap shot could penetrate  mm of homogeneous armor angled at  degrees from the vertical at  yards the mma apcbchet shell was capable of penetrating  mm of homogeneous armor angled  degrees from the vertical at  yards the rare t m hvap shot that saw action in small numbers beginning in september  was capable of penetrating  mm of homogeneous armor angled at  degrees from the vertical at  yards this shot featured a subcaliber tungsten carbide penetrator encased within a steel jacket and aluminum body and ballistic windshield it was standardized as the m in february  by march  about  rounds of this special ammunition had been delivered to the european theater  percent of which were inch projectiles the ma high explosive shell was used for indirect artillery fire or against fortifications and soft targets like infantry in trenches or antitank guns the m hexachloroethane smoke shell was used to create smoke screens or to flush enemy infantry out of buildings or fortified positions secondaryedit a  caliber  mm browning mhb machine gun could be mounted on the top rear of the turret for use against enemy infantry and for antiaircraft use along with  rounds of ammunition stowed in round boxes under the vehicle subfloor the crew also had their personal weapons for selfdefense a thompson submachine gun with  rounds of ammunition was stowed on brackets in the right rear of the turret for use by the vehicle commander the other four crew members were armed with m carbines each carrying as much ammunition on their person as they saw fit an m springfield rifle with  rounds of ammunition was stowed next to the assistant driver and an adapter for the rifle and ten antitank rifle grenades were stowed under the left front vehicle subfloor storage boxes in the turret held five fragmentation grenades five smoke grenades and two thermite grenades combat useedit m in action near saintlô june  m of the st tank destroyer battalion advances along a mountain road in italy  march  united states armyedit two american m tank destroyers in france during world war ii the ms heavy chassis did not conform to the quickly evolving tank destroyer doctrine of employing very light highspeed vehicles and starting in the summer of  it began to be supplemented by the fast m tank destroyer american tank destroyer doctrine called for tank destroyers to be kept in reserve and rushed forward to counter massed enemy armored attacks in reality this was not the case and m battalions were attached often semipermanently to infantry and armored divisions to provide additional direct and indirect fire support typical missions included providing indirect artillery fire by augmenting divisional artillery units following and supporting the lead elements of an infantry assault attacking obstacles such as fortifications and enemy vehicles including tanks that hampered the advance of friendly units and setting up an antitank defense once the objective was secured the combat debut of the m came on  march  during the battle of el guettar part of the north african campaign the m was initially successful as its m inch gun could destroy most german tanks then in service during the battle ms of the th tank destroyer battalion and m gun motor carriages of the st tank destroyer battalion accounted for  german tanks destroyed although  ms and  ms were lost the m did not see much tanktotank action for the rest of the north african campaign and instead was used as mobile fire support during tank fighting in the normandy campaign the ms inch gun was proven to be ineffective against the thick frontal armor of the german panther tank on  july  eisenhowers headquarters requested that all m battalions be converted to the new m as soon as possible on  july  the th tank destroyer battalion blunted a german counterattack by the panzer lehr division near le desert and accounted for  panthers one panzer iv and one sturmgeschütz iii in a fierce twoday battle most of it taking place at ranges of less than  m due to the initial shock of encountering heavy german tanks further changes were made in the tank destroyer force in late september  american officials requested that of the  battalions then committed to the european theater  be converted to the m  retain the m or m at the discretion of their commanders and the  towed battalions be reequipped with the thenprototype t  mm towed gun by october  the improved  mm gun motor carriage m began to arrive in europe and mostly replaced the m by the end of the war the plans to retain any towed battalions at all were canceled after their generally poor performance and high losses in  especially during the battle of the bulge in the italian campaign as in northern europe the ms were normally attached to infantry or armored units as infantry support or mobile artillery more so the latter because of the general lack of german armor in that theater many us divisional commanders asked for their ms to be replaced with fully armored tanks in the pacific war due to the lack of serious japanese tank opposition us army ms were not used as tank destroyers but as mobile artillery and infantry support the m proved unpopular in the pacific due to its open turret which left it vulnerable to japanese closeassault antitank tactics british armyedit a total of  ms were supplied by the united states to the british army via the lendlease program british ms were designated as in spm m the m with the wedge counterweight was known as the in spm m mk i and the m with the duck bill counterweight was designated the in spm m mk ii  of the vehicles were upgunned with the powerful pounder gun from may  to april  a nickname used within the department of tank design for both the inch and pounder versions was achilles the name was not used by troops during the war the pounder conversions were designated various ways with a c suffix added on to the m designation or called pdr m most of the vehicles converted were the in spm m mk ii as the duck bill counterweight better balanced the heavy gun the gun mantlet needed modification to accept the barrel the pounder was of a similar bore to the inch gun m but was longer and used a larger propellant charge it had far superior armor penetrating capabilities the pdr sp achilles was used by the british canadian and polish armies in italy and northwest europe as well as service with british forces in northwest europe they were retained postwar those not upgunned were stripped of their turrets and used as artillery tractors in british service as selfpropelled antitank guns the m was operated by regiments of the royal artillery typically two batteries had ms while the other two batteries had the towed pounder gun one tactical theory was that the two towed batteries would form a gun line while an m battery remained mobile on each flank to drive or lead enemy tanks to the static gun line in practice uk batteries were frequently separated in normandy ms being seconded to british tank brigades equipped with churchill tanks armed with the general purpose  mm gun just as were british  pounder conversions in spm m conversions to pdr month conversions may   june   july

in italy then in france and germany during the liberation of paris in august  a single m of general leclercs nd armored division named “sirocco” disabled a panther in the place de la concorde french ms also saw action on the frenchgerman border around strasbourg and in southern germany the free french first army led by general de lattre received some when they were a part of the sixth united states army group french ms were operated along similar lines as us tank destroyer units although initially with five vehicles per platoon instead of four red armyedit approximately  ms were supplied

tank army this unit served on the rd belorussian front in  taking part in summer campaigns in belorussia the baltic and east prussia the th selfpropelled artillery regiment was part of the th tank corps nd tank army it fought in belorussia and poland in  israeledit israel bought ms from scrapyards and dumping grounds in europe after  the first batch arrived in  being in very bad shape some years later as the ms guns were worn out israel decided to install pounder guns and also french highvelocity  mm cn  guns that had just been bought the ms were repaired and entered service in  after the  war they received the diesel engines of captured egyptian sherman tanks it is believed that israel also bought ms from france and may have captured several from egypt there is no report that the modified ms were used by the israelis in combat they were withdrawn from service by   egyptedit the egyptian army had a small number of exbritish ms inch and pdr versions and used them in  against israel israel captured some of them combat performanceedit the ms opentopped turret left the crew vulnerable to artillery and mortar fire and fragments the rd tank destroyer battalion took many casualties from artillery fire and tree bursts and lost  of  ms during the battle of the hürtgen forest the crew was also exposed to sniper fire and infantry close assault such as grenades thrown through the open turret or attacks from upper storywindows especially in urban warfare and wooded areas in uk service one m in the th antitank regiment xii corps in normandy drove back out of action three times with the turret crew dead two turret crews had been killed by mm air bursts or mortars exploding in treetops and one crew was killed by a direct hit through the turret the same driver survived each time when this driver was placed with a new crew his fourth he was declared to be a jonah bad luck and they refused to drive with him he was transferred to another unit and told to keep quiet about his history however the opentopped turret gave excellent visibility which was valuable for a vehicle that was tasked with finding enemy armored vehicles and other targets the open top also made escape easier when the vehicle was hit and improved communications with accompanying infantry the m had a very slow turret rotation speed as the turret traverse was unpowered and the crew had to use a hand crank to rotate the turret it took approximately  seconds to rotate a full  degrees total m losses in the european theater of operations to all causes were  m strength and losses in the eto
