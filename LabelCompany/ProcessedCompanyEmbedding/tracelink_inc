full complement of us requirements phases in between  and  with challenges for all supply chain companies at different points along the way with the  drug supply chain security act dscsa lotlevel traceability deadline behind us pharmaceutical companies have turned their attention to full drug serialization dscsa requires that manufacturers mark packages with a product identifier serial number lot number and expiration date by november  given everything that needs to happen by then from altering highly regulated packaging and distribution processes to addressing enterprisewide it pharma companies should be well on their way to readiness at the same time wholesale distributors and other supply chain companies will perform endtoend serialization testing with their manufacturing partners in advance of the deadline to allow time for any necessary adjustments product tracing verification and serialization highlights product tracing – by january  pharmaceutical companies and wholesale distributors needed to achieve lotbased traceability which involves sharing a transaction history with every partner to whom you sell product for many companies establishing the necessary infrastructure for communication with partners at the level you need for regulatory compliance was the biggest challenge in addition the law does not prescribe standard formats for data exchange so companies need to be equipped to receive transaction data in many configurations  by july  dispensers needed to be able to receive and archive t information and be prepared to produce it in the event of an inquiry when serialization comes into play product tracking will still be required but the nature of the requirement changes track and trace and serialization requirements will finally converge in   verification –in the event of a suspect product inquiry supply chain companies must be able to produce the relevant transaction documentation within twentyfour hours dispensers have fortyeight the challenge is in being able to locate and access the necessary records in this tight turnaround time businesses need a storage and retrieval mechanism that supports these queries  serialization – during lot level preparation the industry discovered that completing one transaction between two parties was challenging when serialization with its endtoend tracing takes effect businesses will need to manage many transactions involving billions of items with tens to hundreds of partners including outsourcing ones so there is the supply chain communication challenge but there is also a data volume challenge as businesses generate process and store an unprecedented amount of data and transactions in the us the smallest saleable unit and the sealed homogenous case need to be serialized by law aggregation is not required but there is speculation that it will be required at some future point manufacturers must serialize by november  the rest of the supply chain has more time before they need to make full use of the serial numbers but there will be circumstances prior to that in which they need to interact with the serial number like for product returns and suspect product investigations  how tracelink can help tracelink is the worlds largest track and trace network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and eliminating counterfeit prescription drugs from the global marketplace  we have worked with more than  customers from all segments of the supply chain on their compliance strategies that deep collective experience informs our approach in every
