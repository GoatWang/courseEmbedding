challenged and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message inception and early yearsedit the company was established by charles wang and russell artzt in  under regulatory pressure in  ibm announced its decision to unbundle the sale of computer hardware from its software and support services ie mainframe computers from computer programs etc at this time the computer industry was dominated by mainframes and their related operating systems principally from ibm the decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry — an opportunity charles wang along with his friend and business partner russ artzt exploited by creating a company to develop and sell ibm mainframe software so they developed several products for that market with modest success in  they obtained exclusive north american distribution rights for casort a sortmergecopy and data management utility software program that helps mainframe computers manipulate data efficiently the sorting product had previously been distributed by independent software vendor isv pansophic systems under the name pansort casort was originally developed by a swiss isv named computer associates founded by sam goodner and max sevcik several years earlier the product had found success in europe but sales in north america hadnt kept pace wang and artzt established a new venture in partnership with the swiss company which they named transamerican computer associates and went to market with casort along with their original products casorts sorting algorithms and the products performance mostly on the dosvs computing platform combined with modest pricing and the sales acumen of charles wang led to rapid growth in the large and lucrative north american market helping fuel that growth was cas entry to the dosvs enterprise storage management market with software products cadynamt tape management system cadynamd disk or dasd directaccess storage device management and cadynamfi dynamic file independence another useful tool that brought osmvs sophistication to dosvse environments was cadriver a job control language jcl management product casorts primary competitors were syncsort from whitlow computer systems plus dfsort and sm from ibm synergy among cas products became the consistent theme that brought competitive advantage and laid the foundation for the unicenter concept years later sedit throughout the decade the company grew rapidly via several strategic and some surprising acquisitions cga computers top secret product plus software makers capex corporation flagship products optimizer tlms scheduler johnson systems flagship product jars value software flagship product dispatch and uccel corporation among them in recognition of his success in  charles wang was given a software ceo of the year award in may  caunicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired mainframe systems products its sales often wrap  roll financial deals helped bring ca enough revenue and market share especially from existing customers converting from dosvse zvse today to osmvs zos today that ca was eventually able to acquire its archrival uccel corporation in  ownership of those industrystandard flagship products ucc ucc ucc plus acf made ca the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of osmvs security software with catop secret  market share and caacf  market share ibms resource access control facility racf product held the  market share position on may jeffrey r yost phd conservancyumnedubitstreamhandleohbspdf interviewed barry schrager one of acfs three original developers who noted that a when skk was sold in  acf had a  market share while ibm’s racf and ca’s top secret split the other  and b currently  racf has  market share while acf and top secret from ca share the other  percent uccels acquisition also made walter haefner that companys halfowner at the time cas largest individual shareholder—a distinction he enjoyed until his death in june  whereas cas historical focus had been on system utilities including those for the vmcms zvm today mainframe platform the company also sought via its  acquisition of software international to compete in the applications arena against dun  bradstreets former market leaders management science america msa and mccormack  dodge md ca also competed against microsoft and lotus development corporation through the acquisition of companies such as information unlimited software that provided spreadsheet word processor graphics and other applications in addition to its existing cauniverse database management system dbms product ca acquired independent software vendors applied data research adr in  and cullinet in  both companies were struggling against ibm and its db product offering in  cas stock began trading on the new york stock exchange using the ticker symbol ca following its time – on the nasdaq using the stock symbol casi as the decade ended ca became the first software company after microsoft to exceed  billion in sales sedit early in the decade ca was forced to address criticism of the company lack of strategic focus incompatibilities among its disparate product lines a reputation for poor customer service plus failure to win a significant share in application software and database management system markets as well as a sharp decline in its stock price which fell more than  during  the ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets japan canada africa latin america reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as hewlettpackard hp apple computer and digital equipment corporation dec in  ca acquired the ask group which had acquired ingres corporation in  and continued to offer the ingres database management system under a variety of brand names for example openingres ingres ii or advantage ingres ca became the target of several competitors aggressive rip  replace sales campaigns often led by exca employees motivated by revengecitation needed meanwhile ca continued its expansion through acquisitions including many of those competitors most notably in clientserver computing legent corporation for  billion in  at that time the biggestever acquisition in the software industry and data storage software cheyenne software for  billion in  ca again laid claim to the software industrys thenlargest acquisition  billion via platinum technology international in  as part of that acquisition ca obtained the autosys distributed systems vs mainframe job scheduler which platinum had acquired in  shortly after its acquisition of platinum in order to avoid antitrust problems ca had to divest itself of certain mainframe products owning at least six batch processing schedulers the divestiture was primarily of the zteam products zeke job scheduler etc originally from altai inc also acquired by platinum in  ca had previously initiated a lawsuit against altai claiming copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation computer associates intl inc v altai inc after discovering in the late s that cas system adapter code was in altais oscar software module asg software solutions eventually took ownership of those former altai products following cas acquisition of uccel in  many of cas customers felt trapped considering the companys dominance in mainframe security software tape management and batch job scheduling that sense of vendor lockin was exacerbated when mainframe databases datacomdb from adr and idms from cullinet were acquired by ca in the very late s several of cas customers went blindly running into the arms of ibm following ibms  acquisition of tivoli software ibms racf security software gained significant market share and db replaced much of cas mainframe database clientele as did oracle on nonmainframe platforms cas  acquisition of platinum technology came as a shock especially since platinum unabashedly claimed in its sales campaign against smaller isvs like israels new dimension software and its technically superior controlm job scheduler that those competitors could easily be swallowed by ca and that platinum would never be acquired by ca the main reason for defections from ca wasnt that its software was bad but that its behavior as a vendor was those experiences left customers with a bitter taste for isvs and has since allowed ibm to portray all isvs as potential extortionists cas stock price in  dollars spanned a range from a low of  in september  to just over  in december  sedit entering the new millennium ca was

copyright and violations of antitrust laws ca filed a counterclaim also alleging breach of contract including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets the companies reached a settlement in  meanwhile a hostile and unsuccessful takeover bid by ca in  for computer consulting firm computer sciences corporation csc prompted a bribery suit by csc’s then chairman van honeycutt against ca’s founder and then ceo charles wang further controversy followed in  when wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company moreover this receipt a  million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a  stock option occurred while the company faced a slowdown in european markets and an economic slump in asia both of which had affected cas earnings and stock price in total the company took a  million aftertax charge for  billion in payouts to wang and other top ca executives in  a shareholderbased classaction lawsuit accused ca of misstating more than  million in revenue in its  and  fiscal years in order to artificially inflate its stock price an investigation by the securities and exchange commission sec also followed which resulted in charges against the company and some of its former top executives the sec alleged that from  to  ca routinely kept its books open to include quarterly revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet wall street analysts’ expectations the company reached a settlement with the sec and department of justice in  agreeing to pay  million in restitution to shareholders and to reform

to remove this template message inception and early yearsedit the company was established by charles wang and russell artzt in  under regulatory pressure in  ibm announced its decision to unbundle the sale of computer hardware from its software and support services ie mainframe computers from computer programs etc at this time the computer industry was dominated by mainframes and their related operating systems principally from ibm the decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry — an opportunity charles wang along with his friend and business partner russ artzt exploited by creating a company to develop and sell ibm mainframe software so they developed several products for that market with modest success in  they obtained exclusive north american distribution rights for casort a sortmergecopy and data management utility software program that helps mainframe computers manipulate data efficiently the sorting product had previously been distributed by independent software vendor isv pansophic systems under the name pansort casort was originally developed by a swiss isv named computer associates founded by sam goodner and max sevcik several years earlier the product had found success in europe but sales in north america hadnt kept pace wang and artzt established a new venture in partnership with the swiss company which they named transamerican computer associates and went to market with casort along with their original products casorts sorting algorithms and the products performance mostly on the dosvs computing platform combined with modest pricing and the sales acumen of charles wang led to rapid growth in the large and lucrative north american market helping fuel that growth was cas entry to the dosvs enterprise storage management market with software products cadynamt tape management system cadynamd disk or dasd directaccess storage device management and cadynamfi dynamic file independence another useful tool that brought osmvs sophistication to dosvse environments was cadriver a job control language jcl management product casorts primary competitors were syncsort from whitlow computer systems plus dfsort and sm from ibm synergy among cas products became the consistent theme that brought competitive advantage and laid the foundation for the unicenter concept years later sedit throughout the decade the company grew rapidly via several strategic and some surprising acquisitions cga computers top secret product plus software makers capex corporation flagship products optimizer tlms scheduler johnson systems flagship product jars value software flagship product dispatch and uccel corporation among them in recognition of his success in  charles wang was given a software ceo of the year award in may  caunicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired mainframe systems products its sales often wrap  roll financial deals helped bring ca enough revenue and market share especially from existing customers converting from dosvse zvse today to osmvs zos today that ca was eventually able to acquire its archrival uccel corporation in  ownership of those industrystandard flagship products ucc ucc ucc plus acf made ca the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of osmvs security software with catop secret  market share and caacf  market share ibms resource access control facility racf product held the  market share position on may jeffrey r yost phd conservancyumnedubitstreamhandleohbspdf interviewed barry schrager one of acfs three original developers who noted that a when skk was sold in  acf had a  market share while ibm’s racf and ca’s top secret split the other  and b currently  racf has  market share while acf and top secret from ca share the other  percent uccels acquisition also made walter haefner that companys halfowner at the time cas largest individual shareholder—a distinction he enjoyed until his death in june  whereas cas historical focus had been on system utilities including those for the vmcms zvm today mainframe platform the company also sought via its  acquisition of software international to compete in the applications arena against dun  bradstreets former market leaders management science america msa and mccormack  dodge md ca also competed against microsoft and lotus development corporation through the acquisition of companies such as information unlimited software that provided spreadsheet word processor graphics and other applications in addition to its existing cauniverse database management system dbms product ca acquired independent software vendors applied data research adr in  and cullinet in  both companies were struggling against ibm and its db product offering in  cas stock began trading on the new york stock exchange using the ticker symbol ca following its time – on the nasdaq using the stock symbol casi as the decade ended ca became the first software company after microsoft to exceed  billion in sales sedit early in the decade ca was forced to address criticism of the company lack of strategic focus incompatibilities among its disparate product lines a reputation for poor customer service plus failure to win a significant share in application software and database management system markets as well as a sharp decline in its stock price which fell more than  during  the ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets japan canada africa latin america reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as hewlettpackard hp apple computer and digital equipment corporation dec in  ca acquired the ask group which had acquired ingres corporation in  and continued to offer the ingres database management system under a variety of brand names for example openingres ingres ii or advantage ingres ca became the target of several competitors aggressive rip  replace sales campaigns often led by exca employees motivated by revengecitation needed meanwhile ca continued its expansion through acquisitions including many of those competitors most notably in clientserver computing legent corporation for  billion in  at that time the biggestever acquisition in the software industry and data storage software cheyenne software for  billion in  ca again laid claim to the software industrys thenlargest acquisition  billion via platinum technology international in  as part of that acquisition ca obtained the autosys distributed systems vs mainframe job scheduler which platinum had acquired in  shortly after its acquisition of platinum in order to avoid antitrust problems ca had to divest itself of certain mainframe products owning at least six batch processing schedulers the divestiture was primarily of the zteam products zeke job scheduler etc originally from altai inc also acquired by platinum in  ca had previously initiated a lawsuit against altai claiming copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation computer associates intl inc v altai inc after discovering in the late s that cas system adapter code was in altais oscar software module asg software solutions eventually took ownership of those former altai products following cas acquisition of uccel in  many of cas customers felt trapped considering the companys dominance in mainframe security software tape management and batch job scheduling that sense of vendor lockin was exacerbated when mainframe databases datacomdb from adr and idms from cullinet were acquired by ca in the very late s several of cas customers went blindly running into the arms of ibm following ibms  acquisition of tivoli software ibms racf security software gained significant market share and db replaced much of cas mainframe database clientele as did oracle on nonmainframe platforms cas  acquisition of platinum technology came as a shock especially since platinum unabashedly claimed in its sales campaign against smaller isvs like israels new dimension software and its technically superior controlm job scheduler that those competitors could easily be swallowed by ca and that platinum would never be acquired by ca the main reason for defections from ca wasnt that its software was bad but that its behavior as a vendor was those experiences left customers with a bitter taste for isvs and has since allowed ibm to portray all isvs as potential extortionists cas stock price in  dollars spanned a range from a low of  in september  to just over  in december  sedit entering the new millennium ca was the assemblage of some  acquired companies ca faced further challenges in the early s including constraints imposed by the us department of justice on acquisitions the need to service and refinance large amounts of debt and a proxy battle between the board and

technologies acquired veracode inc controversiesedit ca has been party to a number of lawsuits over its fortyyear history and particularly so during the period from the early s to early s one of the higherprofile disputes was a  suit by electronic data systems eds which was a ca customer eds accused ca of breach of contract including misuse of copyright and violations of antitrust laws ca filed a counterclaim also alleging breach of contract including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets the companies reached a settlement in  meanwhile a hostile and unsuccessful takeover bid by ca in  for computer consulting firm computer sciences corporation csc prompted a bribery suit by csc’s then chairman van honeycutt against ca’s founder and then ceo charles wang further controversy followed in  when wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company moreover this receipt a  million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a  stock option occurred while the company faced a slowdown in european markets and an economic slump in asia both of which had affected cas earnings and stock price in total the company took a  million aftertax charge for  billion in payouts to wang and other top ca executives in  a shareholderbased classaction lawsuit accused ca of misstating more than  million in revenue in its  and  fiscal years

executives the sec alleged that from  to  ca routinely kept its books open to include quarterly revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet wall street analysts’ expectations the company reached a settlement with the sec and department of justice in  agreeing to pay  million in restitution to shareholders and to reform its corporate governance and financial

charles wang and russell artzt in  under regulatory pressure in  ibm announced its decision to unbundle the sale of computer hardware from its software and support services ie mainframe computers from computer programs etc at this time the computer industry was dominated by mainframes and their related operating systems principally from ibm the decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry — an opportunity charles wang along with his friend and business partner russ artzt exploited by creating a company to develop and sell ibm mainframe software so they developed several products for that market with modest success in  they obtained exclusive north american distribution rights for casort a sortmergecopy and data management utility software program that helps mainframe computers manipulate data efficiently the sorting product had previously been distributed by independent software vendor isv pansophic systems under the name pansort casort was originally developed by a swiss isv named computer associates founded by sam goodner and max sevcik several years earlier the product had found success in europe but sales in north america hadnt kept pace wang and artzt established a new venture in partnership with the swiss company which they named transamerican computer associates and went to market with casort along with their original products casorts sorting algorithms and the products performance mostly on the dosvs computing platform combined with modest pricing and the sales acumen of charles wang led to rapid growth in the large and lucrative north american market helping fuel that growth was cas entry to the dosvs enterprise storage management market with software products cadynamt tape management system cadynamd disk or dasd directaccess storage device management and cadynamfi dynamic file independence another useful tool that brought osmvs sophistication to dosvse environments was cadriver a job control language jcl management product casorts primary competitors were syncsort from whitlow computer systems plus dfsort and sm from ibm synergy among cas products became the consistent theme that brought competitive advantage and laid the foundation for the unicenter concept years later sedit throughout the decade the company grew rapidly via several strategic and some surprising acquisitions cga computers top secret product plus software makers capex corporation flagship products optimizer tlms scheduler johnson systems flagship product jars value software flagship product dispatch and uccel corporation among them in recognition of his success in  charles wang was given a software ceo of the year award in may  caunicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired mainframe systems products its sales often wrap  roll financial deals helped bring ca enough revenue and market share especially from existing customers converting from dosvse zvse today to osmvs zos today that ca was eventually able to acquire its archrival uccel corporation in  ownership of those industrystandard flagship products ucc ucc ucc plus acf made ca the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of osmvs security software with catop secret  market share and caacf  market share ibms resource access control facility racf product held the  market share position on may jeffrey r yost phd conservancyumnedubitstreamhandleohbspdf interviewed barry schrager one of acfs three original developers who noted that a when skk was sold in  acf had a  market share while ibm’s racf and ca’s top secret split the other  and b currently  racf has  market share while acf and top secret from ca share the other  percent uccels acquisition also made walter haefner that companys halfowner at the time cas largest individual shareholder—a distinction he enjoyed until his death in june  whereas cas historical focus had been on system utilities including those for the vmcms zvm today mainframe platform the company also sought via its  acquisition of software international to compete in the applications arena against dun  bradstreets former market leaders management science america msa and mccormack  dodge md ca also competed against microsoft and lotus development corporation through the acquisition of companies such as information unlimited software that provided spreadsheet word processor graphics and other applications in addition to its existing cauniverse database management system dbms product ca acquired independent software vendors applied data research adr in  and cullinet in  both companies were struggling against ibm and its db product offering in  cas stock began trading on the new york stock exchange using the ticker symbol ca following its time – on the nasdaq using the stock symbol casi as the decade ended ca became the first software company after microsoft to exceed  billion in sales sedit early in the decade ca was forced to address criticism of the company lack of strategic focus incompatibilities among its disparate product lines a reputation for poor customer service plus failure to win a significant share in application software and database management system markets as well as a sharp decline in its stock price which fell more than  during  the ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets japan canada africa latin america reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as hewlettpackard hp apple computer and digital equipment corporation dec in  ca acquired the ask group which had acquired ingres corporation in  and continued to offer the ingres database management system under a variety of brand names for example openingres ingres ii or advantage ingres ca became the target of several competitors aggressive rip  replace sales campaigns often led by exca employees motivated by revengecitation needed meanwhile ca continued its expansion through acquisitions including many of those competitors most notably in clientserver computing legent corporation for  billion in  at that time the biggestever acquisition in the software industry and data storage software cheyenne software for  billion in  ca again laid claim to the software industrys thenlargest acquisition  billion via platinum technology international in  as part of that acquisition ca obtained the autosys distributed systems vs mainframe job scheduler which platinum had acquired in  shortly after its acquisition of platinum in order to avoid antitrust problems ca had to divest itself of certain mainframe products owning at least six batch processing schedulers the divestiture was primarily of the zteam products zeke job scheduler etc originally from altai inc also acquired by platinum in  ca had previously initiated a lawsuit against altai claiming copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation computer associates intl inc v altai inc after discovering in the late s that cas system adapter code was in altais oscar software module asg software solutions eventually took ownership of those former altai products following cas acquisition of uccel in  many of cas customers felt trapped considering the companys dominance in mainframe security software tape management and batch job scheduling that sense of vendor lockin was exacerbated when mainframe databases datacomdb from adr and idms from cullinet were acquired by ca in the very late s several of cas customers went blindly running into the arms of ibm following ibms  acquisition of tivoli software ibms racf security software gained significant market share and db replaced much of cas mainframe database clientele as did oracle on nonmainframe platforms cas  acquisition of platinum technology came as a shock especially since platinum unabashedly claimed in its sales campaign against smaller isvs like israels new dimension software and its technically superior controlm job scheduler that those competitors could easily be swallowed by ca and that platinum would never be acquired by ca the main reason for defections from ca wasnt that its software was bad but that its behavior as a vendor was those experiences left customers with a bitter taste for isvs and has since allowed ibm to portray all isvs as potential extortionists cas stock price in  dollars spanned a range from a low of  in september  to just over  in december  sedit entering the new millennium ca was the assemblage of some  acquired companies ca faced further challenges in the early s including constraints imposed by the us department of justice on

fortyyear history and particularly so during the period from the early s to early s one of the higherprofile disputes was a  suit by electronic data systems eds which was a ca customer eds accused ca of breach of contract including misuse of copyright and violations of antitrust laws ca filed a counterclaim also alleging breach of contract including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets the companies reached a settlement in  meanwhile a hostile and unsuccessful takeover bid by ca in  for computer consulting firm computer sciences corporation csc prompted a bribery suit by csc’s then chairman van honeycutt against ca’s founder and then ceo charles wang further controversy followed in  when wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company moreover this receipt a  million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a  stock option occurred while the company faced a slowdown in european markets and an economic slump in asia both of which had affected cas earnings and stock price in total the company took a  million aftertax charge for  billion in payouts to wang and other top ca executives in  a shareholderbased classaction lawsuit accused ca of misstating more than  million in revenue in its  and  fiscal years in order to artificially inflate its stock price an investigation by the securities and exchange commission sec also followed which resulted in charges against the company and some of its former top executives the sec alleged that from  to  ca routinely kept its books open to include quarterly revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet wall street analysts’ expectations the company reached a settlement with the sec and department of justice in  agreeing to pay  million in restitution to shareholders and to reform its corporate governance and financial accounting controls eight ca executives since pleaded guilty to fraud charges – most notably former ceo and chairman sanjay kumar

challenged and removed july  learn how and when to remove this template message inception and early yearsedit the company was established by charles wang and russell artzt in  under regulatory pressure in  ibm announced its decision to unbundle the sale of computer hardware from its software and support services ie mainframe computers from computer programs etc at this time the computer industry was dominated by mainframes and their related operating systems principally from ibm the decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry — an opportunity charles wang along with his friend and business partner russ artzt exploited by creating a company to develop and sell ibm mainframe software so they developed several products for that market with modest success in  they obtained exclusive north american distribution rights for casort a sortmergecopy and data management utility software program that helps mainframe computers manipulate data efficiently the sorting product had previously been distributed by independent software vendor isv pansophic systems under the name pansort casort was originally developed by a swiss isv named computer associates founded by sam goodner and max sevcik several years earlier the product had found success in europe but sales in north america hadnt kept pace wang and artzt established a new venture in partnership with the swiss company which they named transamerican computer associates and went to market with casort along with their original products casorts sorting algorithms and the products performance mostly on the dosvs computing platform combined with modest pricing and the sales acumen of charles wang led to rapid growth in the large and lucrative north american market helping fuel that growth was cas entry to the dosvs enterprise storage management market with software products cadynamt tape management system cadynamd disk or dasd directaccess storage device management and cadynamfi dynamic file independence another useful tool that brought osmvs sophistication to dosvse environments was cadriver a job control language jcl management product casorts primary competitors were syncsort from whitlow computer systems plus dfsort and sm from ibm synergy among cas products became the consistent theme that brought competitive advantage and laid the foundation for the unicenter concept years later sedit throughout the decade the company grew rapidly via several strategic and some surprising acquisitions cga computers top secret product plus software makers capex corporation flagship products optimizer tlms scheduler johnson systems flagship product jars value software flagship product dispatch and uccel corporation among them in recognition of his success in  charles wang was given a software ceo of the year award in may  caunicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired mainframe systems products its sales often wrap  roll financial deals helped bring ca enough revenue and market share especially from existing customers converting from dosvse zvse today to osmvs zos today that ca was eventually able to acquire its archrival uccel corporation in  ownership of those industrystandard flagship products ucc ucc ucc plus acf made ca the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of osmvs security software with catop secret  market share and caacf  market share ibms resource access control facility racf product held the  market share position on may jeffrey r yost phd conservancyumnedubitstreamhandleohbspdf interviewed barry schrager one of acfs three original developers who noted that a when skk was sold in  acf had a  market share while ibm’s racf and ca’s top secret split the other  and b currently  racf has  market share while acf and top secret from ca share the other  percent uccels acquisition also made walter haefner that companys halfowner at the time cas largest individual shareholder—a distinction he enjoyed until his death in june  whereas cas historical focus had been on system utilities including those for the vmcms zvm today mainframe platform the company also sought via its  acquisition of software international to compete in the applications arena against dun  bradstreets former market leaders management science america msa and mccormack  dodge md ca also competed against microsoft and lotus development corporation through the acquisition of companies such as information unlimited software that provided spreadsheet word processor graphics and other applications in addition to its existing cauniverse database management system dbms product ca acquired independent software vendors applied data research adr in  and cullinet in  both companies were struggling against ibm and its db product offering in  cas stock began trading on the new york stock exchange using the ticker symbol ca following its time – on the nasdaq using the stock symbol casi as the decade ended ca became the first software company after microsoft to exceed  billion in sales sedit early in the decade ca was forced to address criticism of the company lack of strategic focus incompatibilities among its disparate product lines a reputation for poor customer service plus failure to win a significant share in application software and database management system markets as well as a sharp decline in its stock price which fell more than  during  the ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets japan canada africa latin america reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as hewlettpackard hp apple computer and digital equipment corporation dec in  ca acquired the ask group which had acquired ingres corporation in  and continued to offer the ingres database management system under a variety of brand names for example openingres ingres ii or advantage ingres ca became the target of several competitors aggressive rip  replace sales campaigns often led by exca employees motivated by revengecitation needed meanwhile ca continued its expansion through acquisitions including many of those competitors most notably in clientserver computing legent corporation for  billion in  at that time the biggestever acquisition in the software industry and data storage software cheyenne software for  billion in  ca again laid claim to the software industrys thenlargest acquisition  billion via platinum technology international in  as part of that acquisition ca obtained the autosys distributed systems vs mainframe job scheduler which platinum had acquired in  shortly after its acquisition of platinum in order to avoid antitrust problems ca had to divest itself of certain mainframe products owning at least six batch processing schedulers the divestiture was primarily of the zteam products zeke job scheduler etc originally from altai inc also acquired by platinum in  ca had previously initiated a lawsuit against altai claiming copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation computer associates intl inc v altai inc after discovering in the late s that cas system adapter code was in altais oscar software module asg software solutions eventually took ownership of those former altai products following cas acquisition of uccel in  many of cas customers felt trapped considering the companys dominance in mainframe security software tape management and batch job scheduling that sense of vendor lockin was exacerbated when mainframe databases datacomdb from adr and idms from cullinet were acquired by ca in the very late s several of cas customers went blindly running into the arms of ibm following ibms  acquisition of tivoli software ibms racf security software gained significant market share and db replaced much of cas mainframe database clientele as did oracle on nonmainframe platforms cas  acquisition of platinum technology came as a shock especially since platinum unabashedly claimed in its sales campaign against smaller isvs like israels new dimension software and its technically superior controlm job scheduler that those competitors could easily be swallowed by ca and that platinum would never be acquired by ca the main reason for defections from ca wasnt that its software was bad but that its behavior as a vendor was those experiences left customers with a bitter taste for isvs and has since allowed ibm to portray all isvs as potential extortionists cas stock price in  dollars spanned a range from a low of  in september  to just over  in december  sedit entering the new millennium ca was

formerly uc software and sbb software in march  ca technologies acquired veracode inc controversiesedit ca has been party to a number of lawsuits over its fortyyear history and particularly so during the period from the early s to early s one of the higherprofile disputes was a  suit by electronic data systems eds which was a ca customer eds accused ca of breach of contract including misuse of copyright and violations of antitrust laws ca filed a counterclaim also alleging breach of contract including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets the companies reached a settlement in  meanwhile a hostile and unsuccessful takeover bid by ca in  for computer consulting firm computer sciences corporation csc prompted a bribery suit by csc’s then chairman van honeycutt against ca’s founder and then ceo charles wang further controversy followed in  when wang received the largest bonus in history at that time from a public company moreover this receipt a  million stock grant that dated to the vesting of a  stock option occurred while the company faced a slowdown in european markets and an economic slump in asia both of which had affected cas earnings and stock price in total the company took a  million aftertax charge for  billion in payouts to wang and other top ca executives in  a shareholderbased classaction lawsuit accused ca of misstating more than  million in revenue in its  and  fiscal years in order to artificially inflate its stock price an investigation by the securities and exchange commission sec also followed which resulted in charges against the company and some of its former top executives the sec alleged that from  to  ca routinely kept its books open to include quarterly revenue from contracts executed after the quarter ended in order to meet wall street analysts’ expectations the company reached a settlement with the sec and department of justice in  agreeing to pay  million in restitution to shareholders and to reform its corporate governance and financial accounting controls eight ca executives since pleaded guilty to fraud charges – most notably former ceo and chairman sanjay kumar who received a year prison sentence for orchestrating the scandal the company subsequently made sweeping changes through virtually all of its senior leadership positions acquisitionsedit ca has a long history of acquisitions in
