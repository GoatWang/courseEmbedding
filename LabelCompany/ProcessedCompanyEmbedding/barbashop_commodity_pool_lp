you should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition limited partnership agreement disclosure document ronald barba is a veteran of over  years managing client’s money in the commodity markets   mr barba manages a commodity pool  known as the barbashop commodity pool lp the “fund”  the fund will be operated by the barbashop llc “tbl” which is registered with the commodity futures trading commission as a commodity pool operator and is a member of the national futures association  mr barba is the trading principal of tbl and will make all trading decisions for the fund  when trading for the fund mr barba intends to invest a low percentage of the fund’s assets in an attempt to make short term profits  it is anticipated that this approach will lead to smaller monthly returns than in the past  however  this should also lead to smaller monthly losses when they occur and hopefully more consistent profitable years  the fund provides investment exposure to commodity markets using exchangetraded futures contracts and options on futures contracts  the fund has the flexibility to hold both long positions which benefit from rising prices and short positions which benefit from declining prices  the fund is an alternative investment to the stock market and an excellent  way to diversify an investor’s portfolio past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results  the risk of loss in trading commodities is substantial therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition  futures are highly speculative and there is no guarantee you will see profits     minimum investment  copyright ronald barba all rights reserved  view on mobile barbashop

this is april’s installment in a series of monthly posts about new commodity pool launches highlights of note this month a big slow down in the rate of pool registration this post covers roughly  calendar days and saw  pools registered a rate of around week – much lower than the week we saw last time the big name firms in total were registering pools at a rate of week way below the  we saw in the last post wellington was most active setting up  new opaquely named pools tudor looks like it is rejiggering things having set up a series of  trading lps gmo has established a fund aiming to capitalize on climate change aqr has added another offshore style premia fund presumably a feeder in a similar vein goldman has established a customized risk premia pool please let me know in the comments if this kind of overview is helpful or if there is something of particular interest to you that you would like me to address background a hedge fund is typically registered as commodity pool and the underlying strategy can often be inferred from the name new pool registrations give you useful market and competitive information if nothing else you may get a headsup that a competitor is bringing something new to market the source of data is the national futures association’s nfa background affiliation status information center basic website these posts run in parallel with my other series on biggest hedge funds by regulatory assets under management that series uses data sourced from the sec’s investment advisor public depository website between  and  new pools are registered with the nfa each month so i don’t have space to list them all here i limit the table to those pools registered by the largest hedge fund firms this way you can see the latest productrelated strategic moves being made by the biggest players get the raw data if you are interested in a data file which includes the  most recently registered pools use the adjacent “request file” button if you want the

research for this post i made use of a script in r using the rselenium package i have previously published a post about how to set up rselenium using the latest version of selenium and an earlier post reviewing some of the most useful functions in the package this package makes it possible to automate the collection of data from websites the process is called webscraping the nfa assigns pool id numbers in numerical order i start with the most recently identified pool and increment the pool id then search in basic for that pool if the pool is found i record the names and ids of the commodity pool operators i also check for the date the pool ceased trading futures or ceased trading altogether to ensure i do not include dead pools i keep going until i run out of pools i check at least  successive pool ids have no pool associated with them finally for the purpose of this post i purge the list of pool operators who do not appear on my  largest hedge funds master list note that this list includes about  firms who are affiliated with the various large hedge fund companies image source david di veroli on the unsplash website if you enjoyed this post here are some more that may
