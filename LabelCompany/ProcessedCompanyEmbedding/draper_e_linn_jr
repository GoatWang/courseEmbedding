april  he was named chairman president and chief executive officer of aep and all of its major subsidiaries which positions he held until december   he continued to serve as chairman until his retirement in april  as the head of aep draper led the company through the uncertainties of several events the deregulation that followed the  energy policy act the enron collapse of  which shook the entire energy industry and the largest blackout in north american history which occurred on august   by  aep was americas largest electricity generator—with more than  us employees—and a world energy leader with operations in europe and  million customers worldwide the company ranked thirtyfifth on businessweek s  list of the  topperforming companies in may  public utilities fortnightly recognized draper as one of the five best powerindustry ceos for his leadership in restoring the reputation of a great utility name may   early career highlights draper began his career as a faculty member at the university of texas where he taught until  during his time there draper at one point served as the director of the nuclear engineering program between  and  he was employed by gulf state utilities continually moving into positions of increasing responsibility he started out as a nuclear technician and by the mids held senior management positions between  and  draper served as the president and chief executive officer of gulf states utilities draper joined american electric power as president and chief operating officer in  in  he was appointed chairman president and chief executive officer of the company navigating deregulation by  aep served in excess of three million customers in ohio virginia west virginia indiana kentucky michigan and tennessee the company owned all or a portion of  major generating plants  of which were coalfired one a nuclear station and one a pumpedstorage hydroelectricity facility in response to external pressures draper soon began realigning aeps organization and cutting the workforce to adapt to an increasingly competitive marketplace in anticipation of the onset of a radically different electric industry in which the generation transmission and sale of electric power could all potentially become separate businesses he appointed individual presidents at the state levels in preparation for the transition from public monopoly to mere player in the competitive marketplace draper determined that the companys core business should remain power generation although some of his decisions were viewed as aggressive and were unpopular among employees draper ensured that the financial security of the firm remained solid in late  aep acquired central  south west corporation the dallas texas–based publicutility holding company according to draper the merger created a company that was diverse in its fuel its generation and in the workplace—a link between the midwest and southwest reaching from canada to mexico brown december   following the acquisition aep concentrated on wholesale customers—companies that purchased power for resale to residential an commercial customers draper made clear that aep had no plans to expand its distribution business and had no intentions of competing at the retail level the separation of generation transmission and distribution assets was a key factor in preserving aeps shareholder value during this period draper noted in the stockholders letter  annual report aep is a utility that thinks like a growth company this growth will come from our strengths in power generation and related wholesale marketing and energy trading industry shakeup the enron collapse by  aep rivaled the industry leader enron in the volume of electricity and natural gas traded the subsequent collapse of enron shook confidence in aep as well but under drapers leadership aep management was able to reassure investors that its bookkeeping was credible and its balance sheet sound industry analysts reported that aep could sustain a  million writeoff had recorded a net income of  million in  on revenues of  billion and carried debt with investmentgrade ratings in addition analysts predicted that with enron out of the picture aep would be able to garner a larger share of the wholesale energy market as the largest producer of electricity in the united states with a capacity of  megawatts and as much more than a trading house aep was able to emerge unscathed by the exposures of accounting scandals and corporate malfeasance throughout the energy industry following the enron meltdown in response to economic conditions and the pressures that resulted from operating in a restructured competitive marketplace aep began downsizing its trading and wholesalemarketing operations divesting itself of noncore assets and cutting dividends in order to raise capital and shore up its balance sheet during  and  following a creditrating downgrade that was based on the companys risk profile draper refocused aep on its core utility operations and made solid progress toward improved performance by mid draper was able to claim that aeps ability to weather the economic downturns of  and  had been possible because the company never left the basics we stuck to our core strategy throughout the restructuring of our industry we took a look at the restructured industry early on and decided where our expertise lay and recognized that we have been a distributor of electricity for many many years  public utilities fortnightly  may   blackout  on august   much of new york and the northeastern united states and southeastern canada experienced the most widespread blackout in history testifying before the house committee on energy and commerce less than three weeks following the power outage draper stated from the outset let me be clear we did it right the aep system held together—a point of pride for us september   aep managed to isolate itself from the cascading blackout because according to draper our protective systems performed automatically our operators performed and communicated as they should and our load and generation remained in balance september   by december  many of the nations largest electric utilities were experiencing major changes in leadership and aep would be no exception draper announced in april  that he would step down as president and ceo at the end of the year when asked how he would like to be remembered draper said that he hoped people would say that he left aep a strong company that was noted for providing reliable and
