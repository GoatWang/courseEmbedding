asbestos exposure  asbestos manufacturers help us raise awareness get a free wristband asbestos products manufacturers even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world the industry continues to thrive concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than  nations — including the entire european union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use strict us regulations took hold in the s yet countries like russia china brazil and kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale compensation for mesothelioma victims gain access to trust funds grants and other forms of compensation for you or your loved ones get help now at the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life since the late s american companies like the johns manville corporation amassed great wealth by mining manufacturing and selling asbestoscontaining products centuries later medical evidence revealed johns manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers in decades past asbestos use was far more pervasive in the united states contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding construction power generation and heavy manufacturing since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the s asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy in many cases companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits compensation for mesothelioma victims companies that

evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause lifethreatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer asbestosis and mesothelioma the consumption of contaminated products in the united states and many other countries continues according to a  inventory of more than  asbestosladen products approximately  companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year fast fact in  crown cork  seal acquired mundet cork inheriting more than  million current and future asbestos liabilities history of manufacturing although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years it was only during the industrial revolution of the late s that the industry flourished a natural resistance to heat chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications soon enough manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines piping and locomotives thousands of other uses later emerged and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers gaskets cement roofing materials and automotive brake pads by the early th century some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers but rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation internal documents indicate that johns manville executives were aware of the risks as early as  the company conducted private medical studies around this time and the negative results remained confidential for decades asbestos use increased throughout world war ii largely because of military shipbuilding contracts the us government required asbestos insulation be used in us navy and us coast guard vessels for several decades after the war hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products in addition to johns manville other leading asbestos manufacturers include owens corningfibreboard corp raybestosmanhattan co national gypsum corporation wr grace  co celotex corp by the s scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestoss harmful effects one landmark occupational study conducted by dr irving selikoff in  showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers results indicated that between  and  an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer including lung cancer mesothelioma stomach cancer and colorectal cancer selikoffs findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use the result was a significant downturn for americas asbestos industry the us environmental protection agency epa dealt another blow to the industry with the clean air act of  it established the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants several new regulations directly affected the industry specifically companies that milled sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials by the late s many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products although the us geological survey asserts that us asbestos use has fallen  percent since  it is not yet banned in the united states limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials building materials like cement and in various textiles fast fact a c  s stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in  but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade products during the peak era of asbestos consumption it was incorporated into approximately  types of products one of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products a use that spanned industries including construction shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos including ceiling tiles joint compounds cement drywall and roofing materials these products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air the toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope cloth and garments shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction such as gaskets and brake pads contained some percentage of asbestos industries  occupations according to the world health organization about  million people experience workplace exposure worldwide by far the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral these activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction while drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project shipyard workers especially during the world war ii era experienced heavy exposure as well tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous also at risk were pipefitters boiler workers and electricians who serviced us navy and us coast guard ships litigation  specific lawsuits a staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos according to one litigation report from  an estimated  people filed related claims against at least  corporations some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimilliondollar verdicts or outofcourt settlements when courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering medical expenses lost income and loss of consortium many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings in one standout  case us steel was ordered to pay  million to roby whittington the wife of a former us steel employee who died of mesothelioma several other manufacturers defended the case but us steel was found  percent liable for whittington’s death georgiapacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and the jury awarded mrs whittington  million in damages and  million in punitive damages a san francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to alfred todak holding more than  firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis a former electrician todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard navy vessels from  to  eighteen firms settled with todak out of court for a total of  million and foster wheeler ltd contributed  percent of the jury’s  million verdict todak’s wife also received  million for related losses more recently a  lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of  million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets the gasket manufacturers goodyear tire and rubber and goodyear canada were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of walter koczur and eugene mccarthy despite both being longtime smokers fast fact pittsburgh corning announced in  that it would pay out  million in cash over the next  years to cover asbestosrelated claims trust funds with multibilliondollar liabilities looming many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain yet steadily rising costs of legal compensation the us government estimates that more than  companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation including industry giants like national gypsum dana corporation and eaglepicher industries as part of their reorganization plans companies often create personal injury trusts forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities since johns manville created the first trust in  nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust by  these trusts had awarded a total of  billion some of the largest trusts include company funding for claims usg corp  billion pittsburgh corning  billion owens

asbestos exposure asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems including asbestosis lung cancer and mesothelioma a rare aggressive and incurable cancer asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present at home a public building such as a school or government office a war fought on foreign soil or on the job click to expand in fact occupational exposure is the no  cause of asbestos disease that means roofers carpenters electricians plumbers firefighters auto mechanics insulators factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure those who worked in construction shipyards power plants oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job us military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products especially on navy ships for much of the th century until its longterm toxicity became well known thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance versatility and tensile strength get a free mesothelioma guide free information books wristbands and more for patients and caregivers get your free guide get your free mesothelioma guide how exposure happens asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers while no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe most problems arise after repeated and longterm exposures to the carcinogen environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer but it still happens regularly most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems asbestosrelated disease is  percent preventable that fact motivates me it should motivate all of us if we stopped using asbestos by definition we could stop asbestos disease — dr ken takahashi director of the asbestos diseases research institute harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos when asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut sanded drilled or disturbed in any way microscopic fibers enter the air for example the alaska department of environmental conservation adec took issue with the sandblasting practices of alaskabased shipbuilding and repair facility seward ships drydock the adec issued seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled fugitive particulate emissions at its sandblasting operations if workers sandblasted asbestoscontaining materials such as paint insulation or joint compounds off of a vessel the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them fibers can remain airborne for hours placing anyone nearby in danger once inhaled they can become trapped in the respiratory tract where they may stay for life health risks of exposure once inhaled asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation making breathing increasingly difficult they eventually will cause scarring which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer in the early stages symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until  to  years after the initial exposure each year approximately  to  americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure an estimated  americans die annually from an asbestosrelated disease currently an estimated  people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestosrelated illness pleural plaques these are the most common indication of asbestos exposure they are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs asbestosis asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd is not directly caused by asbestos but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease mesothelioma this is a rare aggressive and incurable asbestoscaused cancer lung cancer asbestosrelated lung cancer accounts for approximately  percent of all lung cancer cases asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer where exposure occurs exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments using asbestoscontaining products or working in certain occupations including the us military exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters military every branch of the us armed forces incorporated asbestos people on us navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early s to the s were most at risk since that time thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service battleships aircraft carriers cruisers auxiliary vessels submarines destroyers frigates learn more about veterans and mesothelioma products thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers asbestos may be found in insulation drywall ceiling and floor tiles cements paint and more most homes and commercial buildings built before  contain asbestos products search our asbestos products index occupations workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job drywall tapers electricians firefighters auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk while asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other jobrelated health risks see if your occupation was at risk for exposure job sites asbestos exposure may occur while on the job many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities placing millions of workers at risk for exposure shipyards power plants metal works schools chemical plants oil refineries environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and earthquakes in  the journal of toxicology and environmental health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas the study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising researchers at the university of hawaii cancer center conducted a similar study in  that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in nevada northern california is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos  attack on the world trade center the terrorist attack at the world trade center in new york city on sept   released more than  tons of asbestos into the air causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months according to a  study published in the new england journal of medicine about  percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems it found that  percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble along with nearby residents for

nearby asbestos operations job sites where workers mined handled or processed asbestos often contaminated the outside air with airborne fibers as a result people in nearby communities may face environmental exposures that increase the risk for serious health complications asbestos coverup find out who concealed asbestos risks from their employees learn more read about the asbestos cover up a  study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant the study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma mpm and other asbestosrelated conditions in shubra elkheima egypt an industrial city containing the sigwart company asbestos plant it compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure in total the study had more than  participants the rate of mpm was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure with  percent of this group having the cancer the group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only  percent as expected the control group had the fewest incidences with a rate of  percent these rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening overall the study found a slightly higher but still comparable rate of asbestosrelated illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents improper abatement if asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed it is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks secondhand exposure people can get an asbestosrelated disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral secondhand exposure or indirect exposure can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure while any kind of exposure is much less common today than even  years ago women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the midth century at that time men comprised the majority of the industrial working class the occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestoscontaining products workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them occurrences of secondhand exposure secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children if children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age they may develop an asbestosrelated disease in their adult years there are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure laundry the clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure because of the jagged structure of the fibers the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure furniture if a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home fibers could have become embedded in the couch chairs carpet bed and other pieces of furniture hugs if a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work while family members didnt have any direct contact with asbestoscontaining products the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life between  and  researchers at mount sinai medical center in new york city studied the health of  family members from the  workers employed at a factory in patterson new jersey researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers family members sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former patterson factory workers  years after the factory shut down compensation for asbestos exposure let us help you gain access to trust funds and other forms of compensation for mesothelioma victims get help now get financial assistance legal claims for secondhand exposure like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation in order to bring a successful legal claim they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers this usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job john panza jr diagnosed with mesothelioma in  for example john panza jr a yearold english professor was diagnosed with mesothelioma in  for more than  years his father worked at a brake plant where national friction products corp products were drilled and abraded as a child panza helped his father wash his work clothes in  panza filed a lawsuit against national friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the companys products that contaminated his fathers clothes in  an ohio jury found national friction liable for panzas illness it ordered the company to pay panza and his wife  million the award included  in economic damages  million in noneconomic damages and  million for the wifes loss of consortium claim protecting yourself and loved ones despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life people can protect themselves by being vigilant workers should use protective equipment provided by employers it is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers it also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site showers should be taken before returning home safety equipment and good practices today protect you against

company is a former manufacturer of building products including drywall joint compounds and cements the company was the brainchild of henry j kaiser the influential california businessman whose ventures included kaiser aluminum kaiser steel kaiser motors shipbuilding enterprises and the health care company that would become known as kaiserpermanente born in new york state in  kaiser was a man of big ideas who saw great potential especially in the postworld war ii era he first went into business in  with a sand and gravel plant in  he expanded with a cement company the following year kaiser went into the shipbuilding business filling lucrative ship orders for the us government during the war kaiser’s seven shipyards produced one liberty ship per day more than  in all kaiser was known as a master of “vertical integration” and often founded new companies to work in tandem with other projects he had started for example kaiser founded kaiser aluminum to provide metal for his automotive manufacturing company he was also savvy about the needs of the burgeoning postwar industry during the war kaiser had constructed large housing projects adjacent to his shipyards in the process he learned that shortages were a serious problem in the housing industry plaster wallboard and other supplies were very hard to come by as a result he founded kaiser gypsum company in  kaiser retired in  and shortly thereafter his companies began to be sold off – including kaiser gypsum which was sold in  for  million to a canadian company named domtar the company was later sold again in  to georgia pacific – another company that would eventually come under scrutiny for its use of asbestos asbestos exposure risk at kaiser gypsum joint compound sometimes referred to as “mud” is a spreadable product used in building projects to cover the gaps between adjoining pieces of drywall the substance which can be sold in powder form or premixed is spread over the cracks between two pieces of drywall allowed to dry and then sanded down to create a smooth even wall surface for many years companies – including kaiser gypsum – added a naturally occurring mineral called asbestos to joint compounds the mineral helped to make the product resistant to fire moisture and insects and also helped make it smoother and more spreadable without changing the product’s basic nature it wasn’t just joint compounds that contained asbestos numerous companies used asbestos in thousands of products – everything from oven mitts to boilers to packing materials – to make them stronger more durable or heat and fireresistant the additive was appealing not just because it was so effective but because it was readily available in nature and inexpensive today of course we know that asbestos is not safe when products made with asbestos age or when they are cut or sanded the thin fibrous crystals that comprise the mineral are released into the air this is precisely what occurs when joint compounds such as those made by kaiser gypsum are mixed sanded or when walls that are covered in the compound are demolished when these fibers are inhaled they can become lodged in a person’s lungs and cause devastating health problems like mesothelioma cancer and asbestosis the public for the most part remained unaware of the health risks associated with asbestos until the mids but some say executives at kaiser gypsum knew the dangers much earlier one lawsuit against the company alleged that kaiser gypsum knew of the risks at least by  and possible as early as the company’s founding in  kaiser gypsum products that may have contained asbestos include but are not limited to kaiser gypsum dual purpose joint compound kaiser gypsum joint compound  –  kaiser gypsum oneday joint compound  –   billion available in asbestos trusts for mesothelioma victims to help cover medical costs and provide financial security occupations at risk for asbestos exposure exposure to asbestos in kaiser gypsum products could have occurred in any number of sites both in and out of the workplace individuals who worked on construction sites where the company’s asbestoscontaining joint compounds were used are one group that could be at risk this could include drywall tapers construction workers supervisors masons hod carriers – any type of worker that was on a job site when joint compounds were being mixed or sanded factory workers who worked in kaiser gypsum plants could also be at risk of exposure to airborne asbestos fibers if they handled or worked near bags of raw asbestos fibers truck drivers and hardware store employees could also have been affected if some asbestos particles escaped while they were handling bags of the product in transit demolition workers could also be at risk – even if they worked after the company stopped using asbestos in its products in fact many older buildings today probably still contain hazardous kaiser gypsum products so demolition crews should always exercise caution when working on older sites furthermore anyone who used kaiser gypsum’s joint compounds in a home repair project could be at risk – and so could their families even if a worker’s loved ones never came into contact with an asbestos product directly damage may still be done secondhand if the hazardous asbestos dust is brought home on a worker’s clothes or shoes related

information amount in trust  billion year created  history kaiser aluminum an aluminum refining and product manufacturing company was founded by henry j kaiser in  starting up from two reduction facilities and an aluminum rolling mill kaiser aluminum expanded to include mining and manufacturing processes and the distribution of aluminum a system known as vertical integration as part of its integration model kaiser aluminum acquired bauxite mines and set up refineries where the mined bauxite was transformed into alumina which was crafted into aluminum and used to fabricate aluminum products because asbestos is resistant to high temperatures the company used it to line vessels exposed to extreme heat during the refining process during the s kaiser produced asbestoscontaining materials for the construction industry and the military most notably it produced asbestos fireboard for us navy ships in recent years kaiser aluminums basic structure and direction have undergone revisions as a result the company stopped its bauxite and alumina operations and has focused on producing highgrade aluminum product manufacturing such as aluminum components for the aerospace industry kaiser aluminum now owns  fabricating plants throughout the united states and canada and yields  to  million pounds of aluminum annually in  the company reported revenues of  billion and

trust was formed to process liquidate and pay all valid asbestos personal injury claims for which kaiser has legal responsibility as of  the trust has paid  million in claims kaiser was among several companies that paid settlements to henry and geraldine barabin following their  mesothelioma lawsuit henry barabin developed mesothelioma following years of work for a refinery and paper mill in the lawsuit barabin said he was exposed to both amphibole asbestos from insulation and chrysotile asbestos from working around dryer felts kaiser was one of at least  companies that settled the case and kaiser agreed to a payout of  barabin died in march  industry  occupations kaiser exposed workers to asbestos because it used asbestos during refining and fabricating operations until the us environmental protection agency classified asbestos as a carcinogen and issued a code of regulations restricting its use in the late s during the process of refining alumina from bauxite the materials must be heated to considerable temperatures and the reduction vessels need an insulating agent to coat the external walls and isolate the heat asbestos with its heat and fireretardant qualities and its low cost and durability was an ideal choice for containing the heat involved in the reduction processes and for preventing overheating through a variety of heat resistance and electricity isolation applications asbestos also found its way into the actual fabrication of aluminum products manufactured for the aerospace and automotive industries the use of asbestos in aluminum production and fabrication affected workers in other industries as well products a number of kaiser subsidiaries produced asbestos products for the shipbuilding construction and air and space industries kaiser’s products are also used by the military some kaiser brand asbestoscontaining products include kn plastic chrome ore vee block castable insulation plastic insulation cement blast furnace castable

a result they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma in this section learn about the history of asbestos use about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure learn which job sites across the united states were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos what is asbestos long considered a miracle material asbestos boasts excellent fire and heat resistant properties this naturallyoccurring mineral now known to be a human carcinogen cancercausing agent has a history that dates back to ancient greece asbestos was used as a building material even as far back as during the roman empire asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles during the industrial revolution asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the united states asbestos was used not only in factories but also in oil refineries chemical plants on railroad cars and in shipyards asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives to line tanks and ovens in refineries and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships from engine rooms to galleys as the twentieth century progressed more uses for asbestos were found it was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles insulated america’s new skyscrapers and was used extensively in the construction industry where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds cements roofing shingles ceiling and floor tiles siding stucco plaster and much more those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestosheavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products by the middle of the twentieth century it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma this asbestosrelated cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium this thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface this scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous yet continued to allow its use over time as stories of sick employees became commonplace the american government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos asbestos exposure in the united states exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites in shipyards aboard navy vessels and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings people working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk in addition teachers students and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products such as ceiling or floor tiles equally at risk are families of these workers as asbestos often was carried home on clothing asbestos exposure across the united states alabama alaska arizona arkansas california colorado connecticut delaware

be at risk to develop mesothelioma different types of asbestos exposure military exposure asbestos was used across all branches of the military for many years navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving on ships aircraft carriers destroyers submarines battleships warships etc in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country army veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and while working on military vehicles air force veterans were exposed while working with military aircraft marine corps veterans that spent time at sea aboard navy ships were exposed to asbestos all veterans exposed to asbestos have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma commercial and industrial exposure many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer the types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries power plants steel mills and chemical plants to name a few they all have “high heat” environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas ie fireproof gloves and aprons today even though the use of asbestos has been banned in the united states many existing industrial and commercial structures may still contain a certain level of asbestos it is important that appropriate safety precautions be taken where necessary to prevent harmful exposure and to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma commercial product exposure doityourself home renovation enthusiasts as well as those who worked in the construction trade may have been exposed to asbestos while working with popular building and construction products many of these products were made with asbestos through the late ’s as the projects they were to be used in required that they be heat and fire resistant they included insulation roofing material siding joint compound ceiling tiles flooring and more unfortunately when any of these products were cut sawed filed or sanded asbestos fibers were released into the air in the majority of cases those working with the products did not use appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information about the health hazards of asbestos for many years today as a result construction workers and doityourselfers are at risk for developing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated diseases second hand exposure direct onthejob asbestos exposure did not affect american workers alone their family members were also at risk of developing an asbestosrelated disease as a result of second hand asbestos exposure this type of exposure occurred when workers brought asbestos fibers home on their hair clothing or shoes at the end of the work day those responsible for laundering their work clothes day in and day out were most commonly affected but even small children who spent time with their parent before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at risk of developing an asbestosrelated illness talc exposure talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits due to this some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos while talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure some consumer products namely baby powder and more recently children’s art supplies have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users mostly women to be exposed to asbestos today products using talc are tested for asbestos but that was not always the case because mesothelioma has a long latency period miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestoscontaining talc products unions protect workers from asbestos exposure throughout the united states and across the world hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries from steel workers to plumbers to electricians unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job unions have organized witnesses for court cases have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by megacompanies to compensate asbestos victims compensation for workers exposed to asbestos if you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure you may be entitled to compensation each state has its own deadlines called
