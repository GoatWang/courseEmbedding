skills disciplinary inquiry analys career history analyst   current bridger management llc bridger management manages various pooled investment funds whose primary investment objective is to achieve longterm riskadjusted capital growth generally through investments in equity securities and equity related instruments with emphasis on publicly traded securitiesbridger seeks to acquire long positions in companies where they have identified fundamental value drivers that have not been recognized or fully exploited by the broader investment community long positions typically consist of investments in companies whose growth prospects demonstrate significant potential for high incremental returns on investment with welldefined competitive advantages such advantages may include high barriers to entry large market opportunities and strong management teams they may also seek to acquire long positions in companies whose valuation reflects a disproportionate discount to its private market value or peer group where they have identified a catalyst for capital appreciation these catalysts may include a restructuring spinoff or change in management controlbridger believes that short positions not only serve as a hedge against volatile market conditions but also generate profit opportunities for the clients because of the risks inherent in short selling the firm devotes significant effort to generating short ideas through their field research and proprietary screens bridger may seek to acquire a short position when they determine that the investment community has a fundamental misperception about a company’s business prospects and they have identified a timeline and catalyst for a correction in valuation such catalysts may include product failures customer losses or overestimated market potential short positions may also be taken in companies with balance sheets that reflect significant business risk such companies may have deteriorating fundamentals poor cash generation capabilities and reliance on debt financing bridger may seek to acquire securities of nonus issuers and a variety of fixed income and equity or equity related instruments including swaps options futures and forward contracts as well as any other instruments such as private investment funds managed by third party investment managers the firm may use leveraging and hedging techniques to seek to maximize returns and minimize risk founder   prior nivalis therapeutics inc nivalis therapeutics inc is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company which engages in discovery
