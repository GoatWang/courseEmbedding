nolan today urged presidentelect donald trump to join him in his unequivocal support of the use of exclusively americanmade products in all us infrastructure projects “in my district nearly  iron range miners are out of work along with thousands more steelworkers across the nation because china and other countries are allowed to illegally dump millions of tons of low grade cheap foreign governmentsubsidized steel into our marketplace” nolan said in his letter to the presidentelect “there is no better way to protect american jobs and boost our nation’s economy than to expand investment in our infrastructure impose high tariffs and countervailing duties on cheater nations and fortify ‘buy america’ requirements” nolan has been successful in persuading the obama administration to impose cripplingly high tariffs on foreign steel effectively curtailing the flood of low grade cheap foreign governmentsubsidized steel into the united states he also introduced the american pipeline jobs and safety act which requires that all energy pipelines built and federally permitted in the united states contain  percent american steel – and iron ore that is mined processed or reprocessed in america he plans to reintroduce this legislation in the th congress   the full text of the letter is below december   president elect donald j trump trump tower 7 th avenue new york ny  dear mr presidentelect trump as a member of the house transportation  infrastructure committee and a vocal advocate of rebuilding and investing in our nation’s infrastructure i look forward to working with you to find a bipartisan sensible way to fix our infrastructure crisis and create american jobs with living wages as you know our nation’s roads are crumbling our bridges are collapsing trains are running off the tracks and our pipelines are cracking causing them to spill tons of hazardous materials into our water supply additionally our water infrastructure is corroding causing toxins in our drinking water to harm children’s developing young brains unfortunately we have become a nation of reaction and rely on public disasters – such as the flint michigan incident or the philadelphia pennsylvania amtrak derailment – to address areas where our country is in dire need it is time we become a proactive nation and finally put this era of neglect to an end according to the nation’s civil engineers as well as the alliance for american manufacturing the united states chamber of commerce and our nation’s major unions we must invest  trillion in our infrastructure these investments will modernize our economy and create  million good paying jobs in the process additionally a serious investment plan will  reinvigorate our nation’s transportation and manufacturing sectors both of which have a history of spurring significant economic and job growth during your presidential campaign you promised the american public you will ensure america’s businesses and jobs will stay in the united states and not be sent overseas i commend you for making that commitment and encourage you to live up to that promise during your presidency one way to boost american industry is to strengthen and aggressively enforce our nation’s “buy america” laws by ensuring that transportation infrastructure projects are built with americanmade products i am a firm believer that if we are utilizing american taxpayer money to perform such improvement projects we ought to buy americanmade goods and services to implement them there are far too many projects and initiatives across the country that are being completed with overreliance on foreignmade supplies a trend that harms our economy and kills jobs for example in my district nearly  iron range miners are out of work along with thousands more steelworkers across the nation because china and other countries are allowed to illegally dump millions of tons of low grade cheap foreign governmentsubsidized steel into our marketplace while we have been successful in curtailing this flow with high tariffs and countervailing duties there is additional work to be done to assist in these efforts i introduced the american pipeline jobs and safety act which requires that all energy pipelines built and federally permitted in the united states contain  percent american steel – and iron ore that is mined processed or reprocessed in america i plan to reintroduce this legislation in the th congress there is no better way to protect american jobs and boost our nation’s economy than to expand investment in our infrastructure impose high tariffs and countervailing duties on cheater nations and fortify “buy america” requirements i look forward to working with you to achieve these commonsense objectives for the good of the american people and our nation thank you for your time and attention to this matter   sincerely richard m nolan member of congress issues trade transportation  infrastructure
