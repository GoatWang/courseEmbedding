robert w baird  co inc stifel nicolaus  co inc suntrust robinson humphrey inc wells fargo securities llc summaryarcx is a feebased lp formed by lightfoot to handle logistics needs the firm is primarily focused on the terminalling storage throughput and transloading of crude oil and petroleum products the firms business model surrounds the development and acquisition of terminalling storage rail pipeline and other logistics assets that generate stable cash flows allowing it to pay increasing quarterly cash distributions to unitholders arcxs initial asset base will include  terminals in nine states spread across the east coast gulf coast and midwest these terminals will have approximately  million barrels of storage capacity arcxs initial assets will also include two rail transloading facilities near mobile and an interest in gulf lng holdings valuationarcx offers the following figures in its s balance sheet for the six months ending june   revenue net income total assets total liabilities stockholders equity  arcx will offer a quarterly distribution of  per unit annualized to  per unit assuming the ipo prices at the midpoint of the expected price range at  the distributions would generate an annual yield of  use of proceedsarcx intends to use some of the proceeds from this ipo to purchase a  llc interest in gulf lng holdings which owns a liquefied natural

and a ba from eastern washington university competition arcx competes with other independent terminal operators as well as major oil and gas companies these include companies like kinder morgan nysekmp williams partners nysewpz exxon nysexom and phillips  nysepsx that have more capital and resources conclusionwe are not recommending arcx at the current proposed range of  to  we would reconsider the offering if it prices in the  to  range which we believe is a possibility the firm is offering a very healthy yield and seems to have the means to pay them for the twelve months ended june   arcx generated sufficient cash available for distribution to pay the minimum quarterly distribution on all of its common units the firm is profitable and benefits from the stability and clout associated with the backing from lightfoot along with a highly experienced management team familiar with lightfoots operations arcx has continued to expand its assets aggressively and we wouldnt be surprised to see unitholders getting larger distributions in years to come disclosure i have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote
