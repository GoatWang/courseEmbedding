assetbacked notes asf outlook stable  class d assetbacked notes bbbsf outlook stable key rating drivers strong collateral quality  has a strong weighted average wa nonzero obligor fico score of  a relatively diverse mix of vehicles and a higher concentration of shorterterm contracts compared to prior gmalt transactions lease platforms limited history gmf began originating auto leases in december  therefore empirical data is limited fitch supplemented the gmf data with proxy data from comparable origination platforms to derive a credit loss expectation while rv performance data for gm vehicles were used to derive a residual loss expectation fitchs credit and rv loss proxies for  are  and  respectively sufficient credit enhancement structure initial hard credit enhancement ce totals    and  for class a b c and d notes respectively based on a  credit loss proxy stressed for each rating category and the stressed rv loss expectations of  for aaasf down to bbbsf available ce is sufficient to support each expected rating evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market has been normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects that increasing offlease vehicle supply and pressure from rising production levels will lead to decreased lower residual realizations during the life of the transaction stable corporate health fitch rates gmf bbboutlook stable fitch believes gmf to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer as evidenced by historical performance of its managed portfolio legal structure integrity the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of gmf would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles andor increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and would likely result in declines of ce and loss coverage levels available to the notes decreased ce may make certain note ratings susceptible to potential negative rating actions depending on the extent of the decline in coverage hence fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing a transactions initial base case rv and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes the increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate and severe stresses respectively and are intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a trusts performance due diligence usage fitch was provided with thirdparty due diligence information from deloitte  touche llp the thirdparty due diligence information was provided in form abs due
