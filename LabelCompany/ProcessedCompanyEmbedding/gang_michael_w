michael k carlie continually updated  table of contents  home  foreword  preface  orientation what i learned  conclusions end note  solutions resources  appendix site map  contents  new research uptodate gangrelated news part  why gangs form shortcut to the outline of why gangs form gangs are a type of support system they provide all of the resources needed for survival from payne p  the reason for the existence of a subculture must be that through the solving of particular problems by the collective the individual more efficiently survives that is the subculture allows the individual to derive psychological benefits of recognition and respect consequently the member of the subculture gains in selfesteem and in social status martin et al  pp  introduction while reading about why gangs form it is important to remember two things first as defined in this book a gang is a group of two or more individuals who have an ongoing relationship with each other and support one another individually or collectively in the recurring commission of delinquent andor criminal behavior  second as we learned in the structure of gangs gangs vary widely in their make up they may consist of as few as two people who exhibit little organization in the gang and commit minor delinquent acts or crimes to highly organized crime gangs organized crime crime networks etc involving scores of members involved in sophisticated international crime even minor violations of law are still violations of the law truancy unexcused or inexcusable absences from school as a minor is an example thats why i believe two boys who have an ongoing relationship and who support one another in continually being truant have the potential for becoming a gang gangs are a conscious product of young people organizing their lives on the streets they usually begin as unsupervised male or female peer groups within defined urban spaces some but not all evolve into formal organizations with social economic or political functions and have older members gangs also organize within certain institutions such as prisons and the military with variable ties to outside street gangs or organizations kenneth b clark center no date page two friends playing hooky may not fit the image most people have of a gang but they have the potential of forming one left alone the behavior of the two boys may turn to other violations of law ie loitering disturbing the peace being a public nuisance theft experimenting with drugs and were it to do so more people would see them as a gang  we define group delinquency as lawviolating behavior committed by juveniles in relatively small peer groups that tend to be ephemeral ie loosely organized with shifting leadership curry and spergel  p  perhaps curry and spergel  would not define two associating truants as a gang but i think we should be concerned about them its all a matter of degree and the sooner we recognize what it is that is potentially developing the more likely we are to nip the problem in the bud to use an old expression if the two boys are willing to violate the law and be truant and they know what theyre doing is illegal they have an incorrect mind set they need attention and supervision they need help without it things could get worse why do gangs form  the gang  becomes a mechanism for surviving deprivation and trauma  donna decesare  removed from the internet by november    gangs come into existence and flourish because the needs of the young people in a neighborhood or culture or family are not being met the gang in essence fills the void gardner  p  why do gangs form that may be the single most important question to ask concerning the gang phenomenon the answer to it reveals why some youths join gangs and correspondingly the needs gangs fulfill for youths which are going unmet the situation in the united states is repeated in other cultures as i witnessed when studying the gang situation in canada england and the netherlands nearly everyone i interviewed identified the causes of gang formation within a relatively narrow range of possibilities they believed unmet needs drove many youths to join gangs as did greed and fear the causes of the waves of street gang and wannabe group activity in vancouver were elusive but the main reasons for involvement with  gangs and wannabe groups were economic and ethnic marginality material gain the attraction of supportive peer groups and flight from abusive family circumstances gordon  american psychologist abraham maslow maslow  categorized human needs into higher and lower levels he referred to this as the hierarchy of needs his is a widely accepted model for understanding the biological psychological and social needs of human beings lower level needs he believed must be at least adequately satisfied or met before an individual may successfully pursue the higher level needs the lower level needs are physiological   hunger thirst shelter sex and other bodily needs and safety related   security and protection from physical and emotional harm the higher level needs are  belongingness   affection belonging acceptance and friendship esteem   selfrespect autonomy achievement status recognition and selfactualization   the drive to fulfill ones potential and selffulfillment according to maslow as each lower need is satisfied the next level becomes dominant with selfactualization being the ultimate goal where a need is absent movement to the next level is impeded from this point of view lacking a sense of security a lower level need at home or in school a youth may join with similarly situated youths who provide the needed security absent a sense of belonging a higher level need at home or at school a youth may join with similarly situated youths for mutual support acceptance and friendship the same situation may develop in order to satisfy the other higher level needs  field note i asked the principal of an alternative middle school why some youths get involved in gangs where were going wrong is that the family is not meeting their needs she replied so they go to the gang where they can get them things like being accepted and getting support  good times or bad families should be a place where a child can get unconditional love set goals and parameters of behavior be protected i dont think the kids in gangs are getting those things from their families these kids have not experienced success  and neither have their parents we the community dont support our families at the same time the families need to be self supported  they should not depend on welfare programs and the government weve given them the wheat instead of showing them how to grow it do you know what i mean lots of families have been allowed to be weak thats what i mean and there dont seem to be any family traditions for these kids like in our family we do this or we celebrate that or we believe this is right or that is wrong that seems to be missing we need to teach them process not just give them food housing and jobs instead of using a bus to pick up kids and bring them to school we should use a cattle prod to poke the kids parents to get them to bring their kids to school actually i think the problem has gone on too long we should forget about the parents and just focus on the kids its too late for the parents    i remember what a probation officer told me a couple of months ago about this same thing she said weve lost a generation or two its too late for them all we have left is just working with the kids and hoping we can have a positive impact on them one might ask how do such similarly situated children meet each other children who are abused at home or who are tormented at school may because of their behavior be singled out by school officials for special treatment placing these children in special classes tracks or programs puts them together if the behavior these atrisk youths exhibit leads to police custody they are likely to meet in detention centers upon release these youths are sometimes shunned and intentionally or not placed in a situation where their only friends may be others who have misbehaved the beginnings of a gang are not difficult to see in these scenarios a lack of security or sense of belonging at home however is not the only reason why gangs form the gang is an important social institution for lowincome male youths and young adults from newcomer and residual populations because it often serves social cultural and economic functions no longer adequately performed by family school and the local market spergel et al  preface why gangs form and why some youths join them are two different questions but their answers are inextricably intertwined if you read the professional literature on gangs you will find the topic why youths join gangs discussed far more often than why do gangs form i prefer to write about why gangs form because i believe removing those factors will more effectively reduce gang activity in the long run it puts our focus on the forces which pull or push some youths into a gang rather than on the youths themselves this perspective on why gangs form requires a paradigm shift for those who focus more on the gang members than on the reasons why the gang they joined was created in the first place using the analogy of the spigot and the spill i would rather turn off the spigot than spend an eternity trying to clean up a never ending spill  gangs are an adaptive social mechanism for satisfying the needs of some youth which are not or can not be met through traditional and socially acceptable avenues gangs form to satisfy needs which are going unmet in the families schools and neighborhoods in which they live or which are perceived of as unavailable to the youths who join them moore  encapsulates the multicausal perspective on gangs when he suggests that four community conditions often precede the transition from typical adolescent groupings to established youth gangs  first conventional socializing agents such as families and schools are largely ineffective and alienating  under these conditions conventional adult supervision is largely absent  second the adolescents must have a great deal of free time that is not consumed by other healthy social development roles  third for the gang to become established members must have limited access to appealing conventional career lines that is good adult jobs  finally the young people must have a place to congregate � such a welldefined neighborhood gangs are nothing more than a perversion of what contemporary society is all about  money power sex consumption status leisure amusement people who have the resources have those things how they get the resources determines whether we see their behavior as legal or illegal the behavior may be different between gang members and members of a traditional businessmens organization but the objective is often the same strengthening the organization generating income securing new members honoring outstanding andor longtime members and so on  rosenfield therapist interview some researchers have written about the pushes and pulls of gangs reckless being the among the first  that is there are factors which push youths into gangs and factors which pull them in the pushes are listed in the chart below under why gangs form the pulls are listed under what gangs offer for example economic deprivation may push a youth into a gang because the gang offers an opportunity for economic gain which the youth could not or would not pursue legitimately thats what is attractive about the gang and thus pulls the youth into it street gangs are an amalgam of racism of urban underclass poverty of minority and youth culture of fatalism in the face of rampant deprivation of political insensitivity and the gross ignorance of innercity and innertown america on the part of most of us who dont have to survive there klein  p  there is no one allencompassing reason for the formation of gangs although there may be some reasons which are more significant than others in their initial impact the reasons why i believe gangs form what they offer their members and why some youths join them are presented in the chart below they seem obvious to me now after three years in the field and after reading the findings of many experts on gangs at least three themes form the backdrop against which the causes of gang formation should be understood issues raised by maslows hierarchy of needs provide a silent but ever present backdrop for understanding several of the explanations excerpts from the literature on gangs often allude to the interaction or relationship between one cause for gang formation and another eg the causes are often intermingled the causal role of social disorganization as measured by the weakness of social institutions of informal social control  family school faith institutions on gang formation lies behind several of the explanations rapid urban population change community disintegration increasing poverty and social isolation contribute to institutional failures and the consequent development of youth gangs the interplay of social disorganization and lack of access to legitimate resources in particular figure in the development of seriously deviant groups spergel et al  p  the following are the most apparent explanations for the formation of gangs the explanations are not mutually exclusive and the exact mix of one or more explanations with other explanations may vary over time and from one neighborhood to another there are a few however which regularly appear in chronic gang communities addressing and removing them would have a major impact upon the gang phenomenon there are other explanations not covered here which suggest that the typical sociological and psychological explanations are misleading click on topic  social discrimination or rejection or
