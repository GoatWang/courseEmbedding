and viremia blood sepsis and viremia   about the disease blood sepsis also known as blood poisoning is an infection of the blood stream sepsis is caused when toxin releasing bacteria such as staphylococcus enter the blood blood sepsis is a particularly devastating disease due to the dominoeffect of organ shutdown which causes multiple organ failure blood sepsis causes a whole body inflammatory state called systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs blood sepsis first results in the shutdown of kidneys thus patients require standard dialysis immediately to prevent death as the disease progresses vital signs collapse—the foremost of these being blood pressure subsequently symptoms of sepsis include elevated temperature elevated heart rate respiratory collapse further organ failures altered mental status and cardiac failure septicemia is a major cause of death in the united states and puts people in the intensive care unit at a very high rate only about  of all hospitalizations in the united states are attributed to septicemia though septicemia accounts for as much as  of bedutilization in intensivecare units conventional method of treatment the traditional therapy of blood sepsis relies on intravenous treatment using multiple antibiotics however in intensive care units even with today’s treatment approximately  of patients with severe sepsis and  of patients with septic shock die within  days septicemia is of particular concern because of the exceedingly high cost of treatment for septicemia patients a typical stay in the intensive care unit costs  per day with testing consequently the treatment of blood sepsis is one of the most costly expenditures for hospitals in america the premier biomedical inc solution we hope to conquer blood sepsis and viremia by using our proprietary sequentialdialysis technique method if proven successful this technique would dialyze the toxin producing bacteria out of the blood by using antibodies thus saving countless lives while also providing significant cost savings to hospitals around the country the method will utilize designer antibodies to physically remove the toxin producing bacteria out of the blood the designer antibodies will attach to the toxin producing bacteria and then the antibodyantigen compound will be efficaciously dialyzed out of the blood extracorporeally we hope to demonstrate this methodology in future lab and animal experiments science cancer blood sepsis and viremia fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis ms intellectual property latest news premier biomedical inc

ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get

your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer

costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i know if bing ads is working view a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats ad clicks the number of times your ad appeared impressions spend average costperclick clickthrough rate average ad position cost per acquisition and conversions you can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing can i run more than one ad yes in fact we encourage it only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see whats working best with your target customers frequently businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages getting started with bing ads how do i get started sign up for bing ads which keywords should i choose
