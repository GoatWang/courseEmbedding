growing natural resource company that is increasing its raw material supply of antimony from properties in mexico and third parties around the world usac has produced various antimony products since  and is a fully integrated mining transportation milling smelting and selling company  usac operates the only significant antimony smelter in the united states and it is in a sold out condition the company has proven experience in underground and open pit mining flotation and gravimetric milling crushing and screening dry grinding cyanide leaching precious metal refining pyrometallurgy and marketing operations include a smelter and a precious metal refinery in montana and a smelter and three mills in mexico three mexican properties supply direct shipping ore dso or mill feed for the mexican operations the los juarez property and mill at puerto blanco are being permitted to start gold and silver production that will supplement the antimony values and identify the company as a precious metal producer  usac owns  of the bear river zeolite corp mine in southeast idaho that management  regards as one of the best zeolite properties in the world due to its high cation exchange

antimony   lb  total        construction of the cyanide leach circuit for the puerto blanco mill tailings will begin when the permit is approved by semarnat mexican equivalent of the epa tentatively the plan is to leach in mexico and handle the second part of the process in montana which is expected to cut capex costs significantly reduce operating costs and expedite the start of the circuit  at the wadley deposit in san luis potosi mexico underground miners have been increased to  men plans are underway to reopen the guadalupe deposit in zacatecas mexico mexican production is being increased to compensate for the reduction of australian concentrate processing the company has posted a face book page for united states antimony and another for bear river zeolite and has already seen

the process in montana will reduce capex and expedite the start of the project  mexican antimony production and brz zeolite sales are anticipated to increase to provide cash flow for the leach plant�

operations although usac has extensive antimony mineralization at thompson falls montana the time and cost of repermitting the mine as well as the uncertainty of even getting a permit caused usac to return to mexico to mine most of the mexican antimony deposits are oxide ores or mixed oxide sulfide deposits the oxides are recoverable by gravimetric methods typically jigs and tables the sulfide ores are recoverable by flotation during world war ii the united states  relied on mexico for antimony for military applications historically mexico was at one point the second largest producer of antimony in the world usac does not claim any reserves by sec definitions   los juarez property queretaro mexico  at the los juarez property usac relied on a mexican government publication consejo de recursos minerales monografia geologicominera del estado de querearo pages  the paper reported a reserve of  metric tons containing  grams per ton silver and  antimony  hectares  acres the deposit was interpreted as a manto layered deposit up to  meters thick  although usac used the report to start mining it was disallowed by the sec as a basis for reserves detailed mapping and sampling delineated jasperoid mineralization over an eastwest strike length of  kilometers with a maximum width of  kilometer unlike most mexican deposits this deposit is primarily all sulfide preliminary exploration indicates that it could be a deepseated jasperoid usac controls this property directly the grade of  tons of rock from the minas grande area that was milled assayed  antimony  ounces  grams of silver

antimony mines near wadley state of san luis potosi mexico  donald e white and jenaro gonzales r by  the �san jose mines have produced more antimony than any other district in mexico and they have been surpassed in production by only one or two other deposits in the world�  by  the recorded production was  metric tons of contained antimony metal  since that time the mine has probably produced another  metric tons of metal although the rotterdam price of metal peaked at  per metric ton during april   prices averaged   per metric ton the mineralization is primarily is in five layered deposits or �mantos� that were fed by fracture filling veins that also contain mineralization the zone is approximately  kilometers long and a kilometer in width and has been developed by  kilometers of drifts and tunnels  there are more than  kilometers of drifts and tunnels the ore consists almost entirely of oxide minerals that were recovered by handsorting �direct shipping ore� for smelting gravimetric concentration of the lowergrade material did not start until a water well was drilled in  the u s geological survey noted �if the mining of lowgrade ore becomes feasible in the future large tonnages can be blocked out in the mantos and in the veins in addition dumps resulting from more than  years of mining are readily available� the future of the san jose mines depends to a large extent upon the development of a milling process by means of which antimony can be extracted from lowgrade oxide ores�the mines have been operated for the highgrade deposits  those that contain ore that can be sorted to an antimony content of at least  percent� in the late �s a heavy media separator hms plant was installed with a capacity of up to  tons per day unfortunately the plant recovered only  of the values and made a lowgrade concentrate usac claims no reserves at the present time at wadleyin the last two years usac produced pounds of contained antimony from wadley direct shipping

in the vapor phase on combustion at a temperature of over  f the halogen forms hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid that reacts with the antimony oxide to form antimony trichloride antimony oxychloride antimony tribromide or antimony oxybromide the flame retarding action takes place in the vapor stage above the burning material it is thought that free radicals propagate the flame but the antimony trihalides or antimony oxyhalides act as free radical traps and take up free radicals they inhibit ignition and pyrolysis in the solid liquid and vapor phases   a second process occurs in a solid phase and is the char process the antimony oxide promotes the formation of char essentially carbon on the substrate which reduces volatile gas formation the barrier between the substrate and the vapor phase reduces the available oxygen to the underlying substrate the barrier effect is obtained by almost any inert additive in plastics there is a cross linking with antimony to produce a more stable thermoset polymer additionally in the solid phase the formation of sbci and sboci acts as a dehydrating agent that increases charring sometimes phosphorous compounds tcp magnesium oxide alumina trihydrate molybdic oxide zinc borate or zinc oxide are used in combination or in place of antimony oxide to reduce costs to increase char formation or to reduce smoke however the substitution of the other retardants greatly reduces the flame retardance normally rendered by antimony oxide testing of the amounts of the halogen and antimony oxide in each formulation is necessary to optimize the flame retardance and lower costs alumina trihydrate is not synergistic with halogenated flame retardants it functions as a flame retardant by the release of its water of hydration and cannot be used in high temperature processes zinc borate molybdic oxide zinc oxide and magnesium oxide can be used in conjunction with antimony oxide to augment char formation and decrease smoke replacement of the antimony oxide to meet a smoke requirement compromises the flame retardance a relationship exists between particle size and tinting strength if the particles are very fine less than  nanometers they are below the visual range and there is no tint strength however within the visual range the smaller the particle size the higher the tint strength or conversely the larger the particle size the lower the tint strength                copyright �  united states antimony corporation  web design by beaver creek consultants united states antimony corporation antimony products since        main menu
