annual return value of  with  annual return                   small differences in annual performance have huge effects on the total return where an extra  annual return provides more than  more money

philosophy benefits contact investing strategy at sims capital we invest for the longterm our preferred holding period is forever but at the very minimum we approach every potential investment with an expected  to year holding period the purpose of holding stocks for such a long time span is to allow premium companies to generate strong profits and gain from stock price and dividends and limit tax liabilities by locking in longterm capital gains as value investors we agree with benjamin grahams insight that a share of stock is a piece of an ongoing business as such we try to understand and value an underlying business before we think about buying the corporations stock once we understand a business well enough and can value it with a high degree of confidence we are only comfortable purchasing the stock when we can do so at a significant discount from its intrinsic value the value a third party would pay for the entire business buying in such a disciplined manner provides us with a margin of safety in ben grahams vernacular this simply means that even if our valuation is a little off say the real value is only  of our estimate there is still ample room for appreciation we prefer to buy stock at a  discount a price that is  of intrinsic value although we may go as high as  of intrinsic value for platinum quality companies firms with strong brands strong balance sheets
