centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do

corporation small talk llc  corporation small talk published by home website practice areas contact us « previous  home  next » oct   llcs and real property  benefits and pitfalls do llcs work well to hold title to and deal in real property here are some benefits and potential pitfalls benefit they insulate property owners from personal liability pitfalls the llc normally protects the personal assets of the members from slipandfall and other onsite tort claims as well as protects them from contract and transactional claims related to the property however the llc should get commercial insurance to protect its big asset the property itself from being subject to claims made directly against the llc and dont forget that any sensible lender and many have come to their senses following the subprime credit slide will require the personal guarantees of llc members when they finance property owned by the llc in other words the members will be personally liable for the loan  their llcs limited liability protection will not insulate them from this major liability benefit property can easily be placed in an llc pitfalls you can transfer title to an llc in minutesthe forms are short and clear but dont forget that most existing property loans require you to obtain the consent of the current lender before you transfer ownership to another person or legal entity and most will not agree because they want to requalify the new entity as a borrower and possibly charge new loan origination points and a higher interest rate anticipating your lenders firm no before you make the transfer you must make sure you can refinance by paying off the current loan and taking out another in the name of the llc and as mentioned above the llc members probably will have to personally guarantee the new loan so a transfer may not be worth it also a transfer of property to an llc may have significant collateral effects such as triggering a real property tax reassessment at the propertys current market value you may also face potential tax issues to deal with more on this below benefit property can be transferred into and out of an llc taxfree pitfalls transfers of property into and out of an llc are free of immediate tax consequences but what this really means is that taxes that would normally be due on gain built into the property are only deferred until later when the property or the llc is sold the magic that makes this taxdeferral happen is a complicated set of rules that adjust the members and the llcs basis in the property and the members interests the downside is that it takes an expert tax advisor who is steeped in llc taxes to get this to happen correctly and of course there are plenty of gotchas that can come up to make many transfers of property into and out of an llc immediately taxable another big potential wrinkle is the set of tax rules that applies to encumbered propertythat is property subject to a debt since most real property is subject to a first mortgage and maybe even a second note or a line of credit this is a big wrinkle the tax rules that apply to property loans require additional adjustments to the basis of the llc and its members and these adjustments have to be continuously made as the loans are paid off in other words expect more complications and the need for more tax help if the property is leveraged subject to debt benefit the series llc is ideal for propertydevelopment llcs pitfalls delaware nevada and other states have enacted special sections of their llc law to allow the formation of special series llcs separate assets such as separate parcels of real estate can be isolated behind separate legal and tax firewalls within one series llc each asset is subject to its own liabilities but not those of the other assets in the series llc in other words a real property developer can create one series llc for a multiproperty development project and keep each propertys liability status isolated from the other properties in the llc even if they share a common membership and management structure further because the properties are not owned by separate legal entities each may qualify under the federal tax law for likekind exchange treatmentthat is the ability to swap one for the other without incurring a tax bill sounds too good to be true doesnt it a form of statesanctioned smoke and mirrors it may be  and it may be best to take a waitandsee approach to make sure state courts and the irs approve of these series llc statutes and taxtransfer tactics a downside of setting up a series llc is its complexity it requires a separate set of financial books for each series llc asset and you may have to set one up in a state that is different from the one where the property is located setting up an outofstate series llc raises additional homevsforeign state legal and tax issuesfor example how will your home state treat and tax your outofstate series llc income and loss allocations on each property youll need expert tax help from someone who is familiar with series llcs benefit putting property in an llc places it out of reach of personal creditors pitfalls an interest in an llc is personal property that may be subject to attachment and liquidation by creditors the llc statutes of each state give creditors various rights to obtain charging orders which are formal court orders to seize the economic rights associated with an llc interest if this happens the creditor steps into the shoes of an llc member and collects the members share of llc profits and property as they are paid out by the llc some states also allow llc creditors to exercise the debtors llc voting rights which makes the creditor a substitute member in the llc finally some states go wholehog and let a creditor petition a court to force a sale and liquidation of the llcs property to pay off the creditors claim immediately obviously its important to explore llc state charging order and creditorrights rules if you want to satisfy yourself that your interest in your llcs property is beyond the grasp or at least realistically out of reach of your personal creditors copyright  by anthony mancuso this article

authorized in part b of title iv of the higher education act of  as amended the ffelp program under the plus loan program you can obtain lowcost student loans to help pay for the cost of higher education the plus loan is made to parents of eligible students or to graduate students by lenders the lender cannot require you to provide collateral for the loan to protect the lender from loss in the event of the borrowers death disability bankruptcy or default the loan is guaranteed by a guarantor in certain circumstances the lender also is protected if the student attends a school that closes or if the school falsely certifies the borrowers loan guarantors are reinsured by the us department of education for all or part of the amount of the default claims it pays to lenders  consolidation loan personal student  company consolidation loan student  free student loan consolidation  consolidation loan refinance student  iowa student loan consolidation by prc on february    am as for the charging order certain states i am aware of delaware and nevada limit charging orders to the assets of the member further they are not a very useful debt collection tool as the creditor does not have a votingcontrol interest and has only a right to payment via an economic interest at some uncertain date without any ability to determine when the judgment will be paid off since they cannot force the sale of the membership interest under most state laws and a good operating agreement most creditors simply settle with the debtormember rather than pursue the charging order remedy

to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm
