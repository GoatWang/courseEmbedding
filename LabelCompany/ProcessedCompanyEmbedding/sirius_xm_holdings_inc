sirius xm radio inc a direct wholly owned subsidiary of sirius xm holdings inc sirius xm radio was formed after the us federal communications commission fcc approved the acquisition of xm satellite radio holding inc by sirius satellite radio inc on july    months after the companies first proposed the merger the merger brought the combined companies a total of more than  million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging the deal was valued at  billion not including debt through q  sirius xm has  million subscribers the proposed merger was opposed by those who felt a merger would create a monopoly sirius and xm argued that a merger was the only way that satellite radio could survive contents  premerger  early days of sirius  early days of xm  merger

margolese and robert briskman in  rothblatt founded satellite cd radio in washington dc the company was the first to petition the fcc to assign unused frequencies for satellite radio broadcast which provoked a furor among owners of both large and small terrestrial radio stations in april  rothblatt resigned as chairman and ceo to start a medical research foundation former nasa engineer briskman who designed the companys satellite technology was then appointed chairman and ceo six months later in november  rogers wireless cofounder margolese who had provided financial backing for the venture acquired control of the company and succeeded briskman margolese renamed the company cd radio and spent the next five years lobbying the fcc to allow satellite radio to be deployed and the following five years raising  billion which was used to build and launch three satellites into elliptical orbit from kazakhstan in july  in  after margolese had obtained regulatory clearance and effectively created the industry the fcc also sold a license to xm satellite radio which followed sirius example in november  marketing chief ira bahr convinced margolese to again change the name of the companycitation needed this time to sirius satellite radio in order to avoid association with the soontobeoutdated cd technology having secured installation deals with automakers including bmw chrysler and ford sirius launched the initial phase of its service in four cities on february   expanding to the rest of the contiguous united states on july   in november  margolese stepped down as ceo remaining as chairman until november  with sirius issuing a statement thanking him for his great vision leadership and dedication in creating both sirius and the satellite radio industry joe clayton former ceo of global crossing followed as ceo from november  until november  stayed on as chairman until july  mel karmazin former president of viacom became ceo in november  and remained in that position through the merger until december  early days of xmedit main article xm satellite radio the origin of xm satellite radio was a petition for rulemaking filed at the federal communications commission fcc by regulatory attorney and founder of satellite cd radio martine rothblatt to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the worlds firstever satellite digital audio radio service sdars on may   satellite cd radio inc scdr filed a petition for rule making in which it requested spectrum to offer compact disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters following the allocation nprm the fcc established a december   cutoff date for applications proposing satellite dars to be considered in conjunction with cd radios application one such application came from american mobile radio corporation amrc the predecessor company to xm satellite radio xm satellite radio was founded by lon levin and gary parsons it has its origins in the  formation of the american mobile satellite corporation amsc a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone fax and data signals in  amsc established a unit called the american mobile radio corporation dedicated to developing a satellitebased digital radio service this was spun off as xm satellite radio holdings inc in  its planned financing was complete by july  at which point xm had raised  billion and secured installation agreements with general motors honda and toyota initially scheduled for september   xms service start date was postponed due to the september  terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon xm satellite radios first broadcast was on september   nearly four months before sirius gary parsons served as chairman of xm satellite radio from its inception through the merger and resigned from the position in november  hugh panero served as xms ceo from  until july  shortly after the merger with sirius was proposed nate davis was appointed interim ceo until the merger was completed at which point sirius ceo mel karmazin took over as ceo of the newly merged company sirius xm mergeredit wikinews has related news in depth xm and sirius merger announcementedit after years of speculation the new york post first reported on a potential merger in january  and three months of serious negotiations the  billion merger between sirius and xm was officially announced on february   at the time the nations only two satellite radio providers reported nearly  million combined subscribers with nearly  million belonging to xm with neither having turned an annual profit sirius was valued at  billion and xm at  billion each subscription was sold for  monthly xm and sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs according to their original operating licenses the two companies were not allowed to ever own each others license in proceeding with the merger sirius ceo mel karmazin ignored this rule gambling that the fcc would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule approvaledit after a week review process the justice department approved the sirius and xm merger on march   concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio online streaming and mp players and tablets on july   the fcc approved the merger with a – vote determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the internet fcc chairman kevin martin stated the merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices the biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the us the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio as well as online radiostreaming competition conditions of the merger included allowing any thirdparty company to make satellite radio devices producing new radios that can receive both xm and sirius channels within one year allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have freezing subscription rates for three years setting aside  of its channels for noncommercial programmers and paying  million in fines for past rule violations sirius and xm began merging their channels on november   each share of xm stock was replaced with  shares of sirius stock each companys stockholders initially retained approximately  of the joined company at the time of the merger sirius top programming included channels for npr howard stern and martha stewart live nba and nfl games and live nascar races xms programming included channels

the fcc also sold a license to xm satellite radio which followed sirius example in november  marketing chief ira bahr convinced margolese to again change the name of the companycitation needed this

followed as ceo from november  until november  stayed on as chairman until july  mel karmazin former president of viacom became ceo in november  and remained in that position through the merger until

and founder of satellite cd radio martine rothblatt to establish frequencies and licensing rules for the worlds firstever satellite digital audio radio service sdars on may   satellite cd radio inc scdr filed a petition for rule making in which it requested spectrum to offer compact disc quality digital audio radio service to be delivered by satellites and complementary radio transmitters following the allocation nprm the fcc established a december   cutoff date for applications proposing satellite dars to be considered in conjunction with cd radios application one such application came from american mobile radio corporation amrc the predecessor company to xm satellite radio xm satellite radio was founded by lon levin and gary parsons it has its origins in the  formation of the american mobile satellite corporation amsc a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone fax and data signals in  amsc established a unit called the american mobile radio corporation dedicated to developing a satellitebased digital radio service this was spun off as xm satellite radio holdings inc in  its planned financing was complete by july  at which point xm had raised  billion and secured installation agreements with general motors honda and toyota initially scheduled for september   xms service start date was postponed due to the september  terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon xm satellite radios first broadcast was on september   nearly four months before sirius gary parsons served as chairman of xm satellite radio from its inception through the merger and resigned from the position in november  hugh panero served as xms ceo from  until july  shortly after the merger with sirius was proposed nate davis was appointed interim ceo until the merger was completed at which point sirius ceo mel karmazin took over as ceo of the newly merged company sirius xm mergeredit wikinews has related news in depth xm and sirius merger announcementedit after years of speculation the new york post first reported on a potential merger in january  and three months of serious negotiations the  billion merger between sirius and xm was officially announced on february   at the time the nations only two satellite radio providers reported nearly  million combined subscribers with nearly  million belonging to xm with neither having turned an annual profit sirius was valued at  billion and xm at  billion each subscription was sold for  monthly xm and sirius executives felt the merger would lower programming costs by eliminating overlapping stations and duplicated marketing costs according to their original operating licenses the two companies were not allowed to ever own each others license in proceeding with the merger sirius ceo mel karmazin ignored this rule gambling that the fcc would consider other audio entertainment to be competitors and allow the merger to proceed by waiving the rule approvaledit after a week review process the justice department approved the sirius and xm merger on march   concluding that satellite radio competes with terrestrial radio online streaming and mp players and tablets on july   the fcc approved the merger with a – vote determining that it was not a monopoly because of all the competition on the internet fcc chairman kevin martin stated the merger is in the public interest and will provide consumers with greater flexibility and choices the biggest challenge for the newly unified company was selling more subscriptions with the drop in the number of cars sold annually in the us the subsequent reduced demand for cars equipped with satellite radio as well as online radiostreaming competition conditions of the merger included allowing any thirdparty company to make satellite radio devices producing new radios that can receive both xm and sirius channels within one year allowing consumers to choose which channels they would like to have freezing subscription rates for three years setting aside  of its channels for noncommercial programmers and paying  million in fines for past rule violations sirius and xm began merging their channels on november   each share of xm stock was replaced with  shares of sirius stock each companys stockholders initially retained approximately  of the joined company at the time of the merger

department gave its support to the merger without restrictions attorneys general from  states connecticut iowa maryland mississippi missouri nevada ohio oklahoma rhode island utah and washington urged the fcc to impose restrictions on the merger several congressional democrats also opposed the merger calling it anticompetitive and criticizing the bush administration for allowing it to go through postmergeredit resurgence and growthedit after coming close to filing for chapter  only months after the  merger having gone so far as to hire lawyers to prepare a possible bankruptcy filing sirius xm was able to avoid declaring bankruptcy with the assistance of a  million loan from liberty media in february  which mel karmazin negotiated in exchange for a  equity stake in sirius xm in the fourth quarter of  sirius xm posted a profit for the first time with a net income of  million this came after net losses of  million in the year following the merger the companys resurgence was owed in part to the loan from liberty media increased automobile sales in the us was also a factor sirius xm ended  with  million subscribers by the end of  sirius xms subscriber base had grown to  million mostly due to an increase in partnerships with automakers and car dealers a strong push in the usedcar market and continued improved car sales in the us in general the renewal of radio show host howard sterns contract through   million for five years  million less than sterns previous fiveyear deal was also a factor in the companys steady growth sterns show attracted over  million listeners per week

radiotelevision and telecommunications commission crtc approved the merger of sirius and xms canadian affiliates in siriusxm canada on april   a new york appeals court upheld a new york judges ruling from april  that howard stern was not entitled to stock bonuses based on sirius xms exceeding subscriber target projections the court ruled that subscribers to xm satellite radio from before the sirius xm merger should not be counted as sirius subscribers for the purposes of sterns lawsuit stern argued the opposite because his popularity had played an integral role in helping sirius acquire xm he had been seeking  million in stock bonuses in april  sirius xm surpassed  million total subscribers executivesedit following the merger sirius ceo mel karmazin became ceo of the combined company and xm chairman gary parsons retained his role xm ceo and cofounder hugh panero stepped down in august  shortly after the merger was first announced xm satellite radio executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured golden parachute severance packages that had been approved in  former ceo nate davis received a severance package worth  million erik toppenberg executive

both sirius xm and siriusxm internet radio services prior to the merger sirius offered for a onetime fee a lifetime subscription lasting the lifetime of the receiver not the subscriber after the

and  respectively in joint ventures with canadian companies after the us merger the two canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger but instead remained in competition as distinct services complicating matters was that sirius canada has nearly  of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country and felt they deserved greater than a  split of the new company whereas xm canada felt their deal with the nhl—a particularly lucrative prize in canadian sports broadcasting—also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company on november   xm radio canada and
