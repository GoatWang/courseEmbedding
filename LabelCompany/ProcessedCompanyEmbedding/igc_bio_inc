angela gonzales – august   phoenix business journal robert penny cofounder and ceo of international genomics consortium is starting his sixth company   dr robert penny –  bioscience leader of the year at the azbio awards – october   the new company simply called paradigm is being formed as a nonprofit and will be a spinout of phoenixbased igc in partnership with the university of michigan paradigm will have offices in phoenix and ann arbor mich at um and will employ  people at each of its offices within the first three years penny said “the goal for this is to be a national company” penny said “it will be involved in translating a lot of the sequencing information that is now coming available to drive that into clinical trials and into patient care in the future so patients get the best opportunity to get a drug more likely to work well” its goal is to figure out ways to get the right drug at the right time for the right patient he said penny said he originally was going to form paradigm as a forprofit company like his other ventures including molecular profiling inc but when he talked with his business associates he was referred to dr jay hess chairman of the department of pathology at the um medical school because they seemed to have similar visions “i met with dr hess” penny said “quite frankly he outcompeted every other potential opportunity by a multiple factor” hess said igc has a track record of bringing molecular diagnostics to market he also likes the idea that both igc and the university are nonprofits with a patientfocused vision “we’re doing this because we want to be leaders in bringing personalized medicine to patients in a way that’s going to improve their health” hess said um medical school is known for its research in prostate cancer it has run a molecular diagnostics reference laboratory for the past  years “this is an extension of what we do” hess said while paradigm will start out in cancer research it will expand to other noncancer diseases in the future he said  to learn more about dr robert penny – click here source httpwwwbizjournalscomphoenixnewsrobertpennyfounderofigctohtml
