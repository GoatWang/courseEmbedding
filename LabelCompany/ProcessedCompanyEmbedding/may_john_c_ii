marketbeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months since brokers often use different ratings systems each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of  sell  hold  buy or  strong buy consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell hold buy and strong buy ratings each stocks consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score   sell   hold   buy   strong buy marketbeats consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve monthsmarketbeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and marketbeat has received a report that coverage was dropped ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods
