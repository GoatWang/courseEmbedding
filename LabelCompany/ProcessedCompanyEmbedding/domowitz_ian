new sec liquidity rule could benefit investors  pensions  investments other views new sec liquidity rule could benefit investors by ian domowitz and ameya moghe · january    am · updated  am ian domowitz the securities and exchange commission has voted to adopt new rules affecting the management of liquidity risk in mutual fund portfolios the rules are set to take effect in late  for most mutual fund managers with smaller managers those with less than  billion in under management given until mid to comply while these regulations will impose restrictions on what assets funds can hold and in what quantities we believe funds that adapt appropriately will be rewarded with lower transaction costs and higher returns for their investorsaccording to the rules liquidity risk is essentially defined as the risk that a fund could not meet requests to redeem shares without material dilution of remaining investors interests the mandated approach is granular a fund is required to determine a minimum percentage of assets which must be invested in highly liquid investments a fund also is prohibited from buying additional illiquid securities if more than  of its net assets already are determined to be illiquidas the rule reads now liquidity cannot be judged by legacy measures such as market capitalization we agree “highly liquid investments” are those capable of conversion into cash within three business days without significantly changing the market value of the investment similarly “illiquid investments” are those that cannot be sold in current market conditions in seven days without moving the market unduly identifying such groups and providing suitable strategies for implementation are standard fare for transaction cost analysis related coverage investor protection must be top priority investors urged to look hard at routing trump administration signals new direction for institutional investors now what a short list of things to watch for in  sec to have skeleton crew in first half of  sec finalizes rules requiring more liquidity risk disclosure from mutual funds etfs the general counsel for the investment adviser association has contended the cost of compliance with the liquidity risk rules will be huge we disagree by incorporating the transaction cost requirements into portfolio construction as opposed to checking after the fact implementation expense will be low and there will be improvements in portfolio performance mutual fund managers that already use such an integrated approach have realized a number of benefits including higher returns net of portfolio implementation costsgreater diversification which in the case of the sec regulations involves diversification along the lines of liquidity characteristics lower turnover a major driver of reducing costs hence enhancing realized liquidity reduced rebalancing costs in a world in which average annual turnover is nearly more stable portfolios and reduced overreaction to noisy excess return signals andgreater ability to expand assets under management for a particular strategy a core issue when considering whether to close a fund to further investment there are roughly a dozen papers written by a diverse group of researchers that support these conclusions in one way or another we predict they will be brought back into the spotlight in view of the secs current perspective on proper fund management and disclosurein order to backtest some of these assertions we recently examined a series of longonly longshort and marketneutral portfolios rebalanced monthly over a 3month period ended june  by including implementation costs into the portfolio strategy net returns rise by  while average annualized transaction costs fall  diversification increases roughly  even as the cost of implementation plummets these results are consistent with those of previous studiesmore liquid portfolios are the result while realized returns are enhanced this suggests not only that the sec is on the right track with this rule but that its actions could improve the investor experience beyond just enhanced disclosure requirementswe sought to prove this contention through an examination of two mutual funds in the market today one devoted to us securities and the other to a global set of stocks using our own methodology the existing portfolios are augmented with extremely liquid stocks from a universe of securities with liquidity characteristics in keeping with the sec rule although preliminary the results are suggestive of what can be expectedsuppose for example that the required percentage of liquid securities is  from november  through july  and without changing the funds core investments several good things happen average annualized net returns rise by  for the us stock fund and  for the global investment portfolio very few new names needed to be added to the core holdings in order to achieve this result the average annualized rebalancing cost based on a monthly rebalance exercise declines by  in the us fund and  for the global one riskadjusted net returns rise by  and  respectivelywe offer a basic and very practical message cost reduction and enhanced portfolio liquidity are not only the domain of trading desks the sec ruling recognizes this and points the way toward portfolio performance and liquidity risk reduction lower frictional costs leading to improvement in realized returns and better alignment of return with risk starts with the inclusion of implementation costs in the stock selection and
