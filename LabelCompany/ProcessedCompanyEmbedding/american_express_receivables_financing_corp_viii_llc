objectives are to maintain a broad deep and diverse set of funding sources to finance its assets and meet operating requirements and liquidity programs that enable credco to continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a month period even in the event it is unable to continue to raise new funds under its traditional funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions funding strategy american express has in place an enterprisewide funding policy the principal funding objective is to maintain broad and welldiversified funding sources to allow american express including credco to meet its maturing obligations costeffectively finance current and future asset growth in its global businesses as well as to maintain a strong liquidity profile the diversity of funding sources by type of debt instrument by maturity and by investor base among other factors provides additional insulation from the impact of disruptions in any one type of debt maturity or investor the mix of credcos funding in any period will seek to achieve cost efficiency consistent with both maintaining diversified sources and achieving its liquidity objectives credcos funding strategy and activities are integrated into its assetliability management activities credco like many financial services companies has historically relied on the debt capital markets to fulfill a substantial amount of its funding needs it has a variety of funding sources available to access the debt capital markets including senior unsecured debentures and commercial paper one of the principal tenets of credcos funding strategy is to issue debt with a wide range of maturities to distribute its refinancing requirements across future periods credco continues to assess its funding needs and investor demand and could change the mix of its existing sources as well as add new sources to its funding american express seeks to raise funds to meet the financing needs of itself and all of its subsidiaries including credco including seasonal and other working capital needs while also seeking to maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities that are easily convertible to cash in order to meet the scheduled maturities of all longterm funding obligations on a consolidated basis for a month period credcos funding strategy is designed among other things to maintain appropriate and stable unsecured debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies dominion bond rating services dbrs fitch ratings fitch moodys investor

stable sp a a stable downgrades in the ratings of credcos unsecured debt could result in higher funding costs as well as higher fees related to borrowings under its unused lines of credit declines in credit ratings could also reduce credcos borrowing capacity in the unsecured term debt and commercial paper markets the overall level of the funding provided by credco to other american express affiliates is impacted by a variety of factors among them credcos ratings to the extent that credco is subject to a higher cost of funds whether due to an adverse ratings action or otherwise the affiliates could continue to use or could increase their use of alternative sources of funding for their receivables that offer better pricing table of contents shortterm funding programs credcos
