the president and confirmed by the senate as one of the five commissioners at the ferc as commissioner wellinghoff was influential in moving ferc towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid he has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity he coined the phrase “cashback car” in a contribution to the brookings institution publication “plugin electric vehicles what role for washington” in it he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “cashback car” a reality in  the alliance to save energy honored wellinghoff with its prestigious charles percy award for public service the nonprofit group bestowed the award “in recognition of his decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change” during his time as commissioner wellinghoff also received the enernoc thought leadership award at a summit on energy efficiency and the award for leadership in demand response from the us demand response coordinating committee ferc chairmanedit on march   president barack obama named wellinghoff as ferc chairman wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term the integration of renewable energy sources including wind solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy into the electric grid the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient and the promotion of demandside energy practices including realtime electricity pricing and the use of electric cars all three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology to promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency wellinghoff created a new office within the commission the office of energy policy and innovation the office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets the potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of wellinghoff throughout his career obstacles remain however to the full utilization of wind solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy while these resources provide a growing share of america’s energy they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the wellinghoff’s priorities the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid” this push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions on july   the commission released a smart grid policy statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable ferc to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology a major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities the third of wellinghoff’s top priorities wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid this form of enhanced twoway communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity at times of peak demand and peak prices and other times of grid stress or need consumers could respond by modifying their usage grid operators could in turn respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant online to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market ferc’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much  gw or roughly  by  wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy under his leadership the commission has continued to collaborate with the department of the interior to incubate the growth of this technology this partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects similarly the commission has signed agreements with states such as maine and washington that will help fasttrack new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement under wellinghoffs leadership the commission issued ferc order  on march   which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets this order was opposed by energy economists including professor william w hogan of harvards john f kennedy school professor hogan and robert borlick asserted that order  overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and us economic output at a time of high unemployment furthermore borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses order  was approved by the commission on a  vote commissioner phillip d moeller filed a dissenting opinion the orders compensation scheme was supported by the late alfred kahn then robert julius thorne professor of political economy emeritus at cornell university and special consultant to national economic research associates inc dr kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets all resources selected by the market should receive the same marketclearing price he said however order  also mandates the application of a complex and controversial costbenefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response professor kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at nera believe that he would have opposed such a test a debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of order  appeared in a series of articles published in the electricity journal the edison electric institute american public power association electric power supply association the national electric cooperative association and the old dominion electric cooperative have filed suit in the united states court of appeals dc circuit against the ferc on grounds that order  is anticompetitive and discriminatory  twenty one prominent energy economists including professor hogan and mr borlick joined the plaintiffs as amici curiae on may   a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit struck down ferc order  on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level the panel further concluded that the ferc failed to properly consider commissioner moellers persuasive arguments that order  will result in unjust discriminatory rates the ferc petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panels decisions on may   the united states supreme court agreed to review the dc circuits ruling addressing two questions whether the federal energy regulatory commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the federal power act  u s c a et seq to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the federal energy regulatory commission is arbitrary and capricious on january   the supreme court upheld ferc  overruling the us court of appeals decision the court affirmed that the ferc had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by ferc  stating  in upholding that action we do not discount the cogency of epsa’s arguments in favor of lmpg nor do we say that in opting for lmp instead ferc made the better call it is not our job to render that judgment… our important but limited role is to

ferc commissioneredit in  wellinghoff was appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate as one of the five commissioners at the ferc as commissioner wellinghoff was influential in moving ferc towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid he has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity he coined the phrase “cashback car” in a contribution to the brookings institution publication “plugin electric vehicles what role for washington” in it he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “cashback car” a reality in  the alliance to save energy honored wellinghoff with its prestigious charles percy award for public service the nonprofit group bestowed the award “in recognition of his decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change” during his time as commissioner wellinghoff also received the enernoc thought leadership award at a summit on energy efficiency and the award for leadership in demand response from the us demand response coordinating committee ferc chairmanedit on march   president barack obama named wellinghoff as ferc chairman wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term the integration of renewable energy sources including wind solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy into the electric grid the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient and the promotion of demandside energy practices including realtime electricity pricing and the use of electric cars all three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology to promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency wellinghoff created a new office within the commission the office of energy policy and innovation the office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets the potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of wellinghoff throughout his career obstacles remain however to the full utilization of wind solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy while these resources provide a growing share of america’s energy they remain hampered by their often remote proximity to major population centers and other impediments wellinghoff has made the integration of these resources into the energy market a key aspect of his agenda renewable integration will also be facilitated by another of the wellinghoff’s priorities the development and implementation of advanced broadband and digital technologies collectively referred to as “smart grid” this push to modernize the nation’s energy infrastructure will allow consumers and providers to make more informed decisions about how they use electricity problems stemming from the variable nature of some renewable energy technologies would be reduced if grid operators could easily rely on alternatives when encountering high demand or unfavorable natural conditions on july   the commission released a smart grid policy statement setting priorities for the adoption of new standards and practices that will best enable ferc to facilitate the widespread and expedited use of smart grid technology a major component of an effective smart grid will be improved demand response capabilities the third of wellinghoff’s top priorities wellinghoff has labeled demand response the “killer app” for the smart grid this form of enhanced twoway communication would allow electricity providers to pay consumers to use less electricity at times of peak demand and peak prices and other times of grid stress or need consumers could respond by modifying their usage grid operators could in turn respond with more efficient management of available resources and avoid the high expenses associated with putting another power plant online to generate the electricity necessary to meet demand less wasted electricity would help lower prices for everyone and foster a more efficient and environmentally sustainable market ferc’s most recent assessment of the country’s demand response potential concluded that peak demand could be reduced by as much  gw or roughly  by  wellinghoff has worked to create a receptive environment for new and emerging energy technologies such as hydrokinetic energy under his leadership the commission has continued to collaborate with the department of the interior to incubate the growth of this technology this partnership will facilitate the development of offshore hydrokinetic projects as well as wind and solar projects similarly the commission has signed agreements with states such as maine and washington that will help fasttrack new projects while ensuring that associated environmental concerns are given careful agreement under wellinghoffs leadership the commission issued ferc order  on march   which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets this order was opposed by energy economists including professor william w hogan of harvards john f kennedy school professor hogan and robert borlick asserted that order  overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and us economic output at a time of high unemployment furthermore borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses order  was approved by the commission on a  vote commissioner phillip d moeller filed a dissenting opinion the orders compensation scheme was supported by the late alfred kahn then robert julius thorne professor of political economy emeritus at cornell university and special consultant to national economic research associates inc dr kahn asserted that because demand response is in all essential respects economically equivalent to supply response it should be treated and rewarded the same as generation in competitive power markets all resources selected by the market should receive the same marketclearing price he said however order  also mandates the application of a complex and controversial costbenefit test that limits excessive payments for demand response professor kahn died before this test was introduced and some of his colleagues at nera believe that he would have opposed such a test a debate regarding the economic efficiency and fairness of order  appeared in a series of articles published in the electricity journal the edison electric institute american public power association electric power supply association the national electric cooperative association and the old dominion electric cooperative have filed suit in the united states court of appeals dc circuit against the ferc on grounds that order  is anticompetitive and discriminatory  twenty one prominent energy economists including professor hogan and mr borlick joined the plaintiffs as amici curiae on may   a threejudge panel of the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit struck down ferc order  on the grounds that the agency lacks jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail activity and therefore exclusively subject to regulation at the state level the panel further concluded that the ferc failed to properly consider commissioner moellers persuasive arguments that order  will result in unjust discriminatory rates the ferc petitioned the court for an en banc review of the panels decisions on may   the united states supreme court agreed to review the dc circuits ruling addressing two questions whether the federal energy regulatory commission reasonably concluded that it has authority under the federal power act  u s c a et seq to regulate the rules used by operators of wholesale electricity markets to pay for reductions in electricity consumption and to recoup those payments through adjustments to wholesale rates whether the court of appeals erred in holding that the rule issued by the federal energy regulatory commission is arbitrary and capricious on january   the supreme court upheld ferc  overruling the us court of appeals decision the court affirmed that the ferc had jurisdiction over prices paid for wholesale demand response but did not endorse the specific compensation scheme prescribed by ferc  stating  in upholding that action we do not discount

given careful agreement under wellinghoffs leadership the commission issued ferc order  on march   which prescribes how providers of demand response are to be compensated in the organized wholesale markets this order was opposed by energy economists including professor william w hogan of harvards john f kennedy school professor hogan and robert borlick asserted that order  overcompensates demand response and is likely to produce excessive curtailment of electricity usage and us economic output at a time of high unemployment furthermore borlick said that these subsidies will primarily benefit large industrial companies but will be paid for by residential customers and small businesses order  was approved by the commission on a  vote commissioner phillip d moeller filed a dissenting opinion the orders compensation scheme was supported by the late alfred kahn then robert julius thorne professor of political economy emeritus at cornell university and special consultant to national economic

customers of public utilities ive devoted my career to advocating for the electricity consumers and from my review there is great benefit to those consumers from distributed solar generation—clearly numerous studies have demonstrated it benefits all ratepayers even those who dont install panels on their roof said wellinghoff solarcity has done more than any other organization to advance rooftop solar in the united states and i can think of no greater opportunity to continue my work to unlock the potential benefit of distributed solar generation for all consumers in this country   after

confirmed by the senate as one of the five commissioners at the ferc as commissioner wellinghoff was influential in moving ferc towards prioritizing the removal of barriers to integration of renewable energy into the electric grid he has been an advocate of “demand response” and “smart grid” technologies that will facilitate coordination and communication between electricity consumers and providers allowing consumers to have greater control over their energy usage and the associated costs wellinghoff was an early proponent of improving energy infrastructure to accommodate future demands from automobiles powered primarily by electricity he coined the phrase “cashback car” in a contribution to the brookings institution publication “plugin electric vehicles what role for washington” in it he envisioned a future where drivers not only save money by switching from gasoline but are paid by utilities for use of their batteries to provide and store electricity wellinghoff explained that while the necessary technology already exists improvements to infrastructure will be needed to make the “cashback car” a reality in  the alliance to save energy honored wellinghoff with its prestigious charles percy award for public service the nonprofit group bestowed the award “in recognition of his decades of outstanding public service and his expertise and leadership on energy efficiency as the nation confronts the dual challenge of electricity supply security climate change” during his time as commissioner wellinghoff also received the enernoc thought leadership award at a summit on energy efficiency and the award for leadership in demand response from the us demand response coordinating committee ferc chairmanedit on march   president barack obama named wellinghoff as ferc chairman wellinghoff quickly established three top priorities for his term the integration of renewable energy sources including wind solar geothermal and hydrokinetic energy into the electric grid the implementation of advanced technologies aimed at making the use and distribution of energy more efficient and the promotion of demandside energy practices including realtime electricity pricing and the use of electric cars all three of these priorities will emphasize improvements to the overall efficiency of the nation’s energy infrastructure wellinghoff has vowed to pursue his priorities through the implementation of regulatory practices that ensure a fair and competitive energy market pointing out that it is through competitive energy markets that consumers will reap the full benefits of new technology to promote policies that will increase renewable energy and improve energy efficiency wellinghoff created a new office within the commission the office of energy policy and innovation the office is tasked with providing leadership in the development and formulation of policies and regulations to address emerging issues affecting wholesale and interstate energy markets the potential of renewable energy resources to expand our energy supply while decreasing adverse environmental impact has been an interest of wellinghoff throughout his career obstacles remain however

the grid needs independent distribution system operators the former ferc chair told utility dive author by herman k trabish • published aug   as distributed energy resources come onto the grid in increasing numbers the distribution system may need a new level of regulation to ensure new services get delivered efficiently according to a proposal from jon wellinghoff former ferc chair and current partner at stoel rives and james tong vice president of strategy and government affairs at clean power finance  exferc chair wellinghoff calls for the creation of idsos to operate the distribution grid auto image  link regional transmission operators rtos and independent system operators isos have in partnership with utilities expanded and streamlined the grid’s electricity markets over the last decade now utilities need a partner at the distribution system level to do the same for retail electricity according to the proposal  why the grids needs an independent distribution system operator in order for solar and other distributed energy resources ders to add more value to the bulk system and cause less stress wellinghoff and tong are calling for the creation of an independent distribution system operator idso to handle the planning and operations of the distribution network  today utilities own and rate base transmission system assets while answering to the federal energy regulatory system ferc and leaving daytoday operations to rtos and isos under the proposal they can own and rate base distribution system assets while answering to state regulators and leaving momenttomoment operations to the independent distribution system operator the consolidation of balancing authorities and operational control of the wholesale market system through system operators has proved a much more efficient model wellinghoff coauthor of rooftop parity solar for everyone including utilities told utility dive in an interview the proof is a  study by ferc and four southeastern state commissions that showed entergy could save a minimum of  million over ten years by joining the midcontinent independent system operator he said “now we have the software tools and computing capability to bring those benefits down to the distribution level” wellinghoff said that will grow the system and give der entrepreneurs greater visibility into where the value is in technologies like solar pv and storage  “they will go get that value and that will benefit customers who use and invest in ders” “and that also will create new incentives for innovation” added coauthor and clean power finance vp james tong   isorto council   what an independent distribution system operator would do “state commissions will still have complete authority just like ferc has complete authority over the rtos” wellinghoff said  but their role changes slightly he explained the idso would manage planning and operations the commission would have ultimate approval authority and be “a market overseer enforcer of market rules and creator of market structures much as ferc does now at the wholesale level” an idso would  maintain system safety and reliability provide open and transparent system access implement market mechanisms oversee optimal der deployment and dispatch guard consumers’ access to all transactive energy services allow regulated utilities unregulated energy sellers independent energy and service providers and electricity customers equal opportunity to meet new electricity consumer needs utilities now do the planning and set values at the distribution level tong said “because of that the debates are about net energy metering but the real threat to the existing utility model is that people are becoming more efficient the eia estimates load growth will only be  per year for the next  years”   us eia annual energy outlook    the opportunity for utilities if utilities turn operation of the distribution system over to an idso tong said they can focus on the opportunity to offset slowed load growth by investing in der and dg on the regulated side and opening similar opportunities on the unregulated side “in a world that is all monopolyowned assets utilities could be effective distribution system gatekeepers” tong explained “but in a world with a lot of der and customerowned assets there is an inherent conflict of interest it would be to borrow an analogy like an air traffic controller that also owns an airline” while ferc has begun turning the grid over to system operators state commissions and utilities can similarly turn momenttomoment distribution system operations over to idsos that would free utilities bolster unregulated energy suppliers and independent energy service providers and empower electricity customers an idso would eliminate distribution system encumbrances for regulated utilities the proposal explained and free them from some reliability burdens utilities could then form partnerships with independent generation and service providers those businesses could offer profit opportunities in return for utility capabilities like customer outreach billing project implementation local regulatory expertise and access to capital california regulators have acknowledged the need for streamlining distribution system operations in a proceeding to oversee iou’s implementation of mandated distribution resources plans california ious are mandated to integrate costeffective ders into their distribution systems “with the goal of yielding net benefits to ratepayers”   national institutes of standards and technology   where the systems meet there is an especially important opportunity at the intersection of wholesale transactions on the transmission system and retail transactions on the distribution system wellinghoff said an example is the recent decision by a dc district court that ferc has no jurisdiction over demand response because it is a retail product “there are  megawatts of demand response in pjm and that is of tremendous benefit according to pjm it drove down capacity prices  billion last year” wellinghoff said if that decision stands it could exclude all types of retail activities including distributed generation storage and efficiency” the only way to prevent the loss of what are extremely valuable assets would be the creation of something like an idso he said it could aggregate those retail products and allow a market exchange through a wholesaleretail interface with the bulk system “the states would have jurisdiction over what the court says are retail products and ferc would continue to have jurisdiction over the wholesale products” even utilities that are now opposing the entry of demand response in capacity markets could see benefits instead of “frantically doing whatever they can to prevent customers from reducing usage through things like demand response” wellinghoff said “they could be the owners and maintainers of a distribution system platform upgraded to include demand response on idso plans that they could build and rate base” an idso also would reduce a utility’s risk in the approval process wellinghoff added the idso would do planning through a stakeholder process with the utilities at the table it would then recommend the selected investments to the regulators “that is in essence an independent third party recommending to the commission that upgrades be made that the utility could rate base” wellinghoff said share tweet post email print filed under generation transmission  distribution regulation
