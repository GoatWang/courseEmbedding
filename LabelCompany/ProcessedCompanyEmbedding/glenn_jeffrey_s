shrna strands to become part of the targeting complexes preclinical rnai studies cannot distinguish which viral strand is actually targeted in infected cells here we addressed the question whether the negative hcv genome was bioaccessible to rnai we first screened for the most active shrna molecules against the most conserved regions in the hcv genome which were then used to generate asymmetric antihcv shrnas that produce biologically active rnai specifically directed against the genomic or antigenomic hcv sequences using this simple but powerful and effective method to screen for shrna strand selectivity we demonstrate that the antigenomic strand of hcv is not a viable rnai target during hcv replication these findings provide new insights into hcv biology and have important

whether they could provide a more predictive assessment for clemizole a drug in clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv infection our results demonstrate for the first time that analyses performed in chimeric mice can correctly identify the predominant human drug metabolite before human testing the differences in the rodent and human pathways for clemizole metabolism were of importance because the predominant human metabolite was found to have synergistic antihcv activity moreover studies in chimeric mice also correctly predicted that a ddi would occur in humans

method to target specific release profiles more efficiently by integrating release profiles for an array of different microsphere types this scheme is based on our observation that the resulting release profile from a mixture of different samples can be predicted as the linear summation of the individually measured release profiles of each sample hence by employing a linear equation at each time point and formulating them as a matrix equation we could determine how much of each microsphere type to include in a mixture in order to have a specific release profile in accordance with this

which they are infected there currently exists no systematic framework that explains these genotypespecific response rates since humans are the only known natural hosts for hcva virus that is at least hundreds of years oldone possibility is that over the time frame of this relationship hcv accumulated adaptive mutations that confer increasing resistance to the human immune system given that interferon therapy functions by triggering an immune response we hypothesized that clinical response rates are a reflection of viral evolutionary adaptations to the immune systemwe have performed the

an nterminal amphipathic helix in hepatitis c virus hcv nsb mediates membrane association correct localization of replication complex proteins and hcv rna replication journal of virology elazar m liu p rice c m glenn j s     abstract like other positivestrand rna viruses hepatitis c virus hcv is believed to replicate its rna in association with host cell cytoplasmic membranes because of its association with such membranes nsb one of the viruss nonstructural proteins may play an important role in this process although the mechanistic details are not well understood we identified a putative nterminal amphipathic helix ah in nsb that mediates membrane association introduction of sitedirected mutations designed to disrupt the hydrophobic face of the ah abolishes the ahs ability to mediate membrane association an ah in nsb is conserved across hcv isolates completely disrupting the amphipathic nature of nsbs nterminal helix abolished hcv rna replication whereas partial disruption resulted in an intermediate level of replication finally immunofluorescence studies revealed that hcv replication complex components were mislocalized in the ahdisrupted mutant these results identify a key membranetargeting domain which can form the basis for developing novel antiviral strategies view details for doi jvi view details for web of science id  view details for pubmedid  a nucleotide

there is no effective therapy for most patients we have identified a nucleotide binding motif nbm in one of the viruss nonstructural proteins nsb this structural motif binds and hydrolyzes gtp and is conserved across hcv isolates genetically disrupting the nbm impairs gtp binding and hydrolysis and dramatically inhibits hcv rna replication these results have exciting implications for the hcv life

of antiviral agents journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy einav s glenn j s     abstract prenylation is a sitespecific lipid modification of proteins although first described for a variety of cellular proteins it has become apparent that viruses can also make use of this posttranslational modification provided by their host cells depriving a virus access to prenylation can have dramatic effects on the targeted viruss life cycle selective pharmacological inhibitors of prenylating enzymes have been developed and shown to have potent antiviral effects in both in vitro and in vivo systems because prenylation inhibitors target a host cell function are available in oral form and are surprisingly well tolerated in human trials these compounds represent an attractive new class of antiviral agents with potential for broadspectrum activity after a brief outline of host cell prenylation pathways we review below the development of prenylation inhibition as an antiviral strategy applied to a

farnesyltransferase inhibitory activity here we show that fti another farnesyltransferase inhibitor prevented the production of complete infectious hdv virions of two different genotypes thus in spite of the added complexity and assembly determinants of infectious hdv virions compared to vlps the former are also sensitive to pharmacological prenylation inhibition moreover production of hdv genotype iii virions which is associated with particularly severe clinical disease was as sensitive to prenylation inhibition as was that of hdv genotype i virions farnesyltransferase inhibitors thus represent

engraftment of human hepatocytes into rodents would be useful for the study of human viral hepatitis where it might allow the species technical and size limitations of the current animal models to be overcome although transgenic mice expressing the hepatitis b virus hbv genome produce infectious virus in their serum the viral life cycle is not complete in that the early stages of viral binding and entry into hepatocytes and production of an episomal transcriptional dna template do not occur as for hepatitis delta virus hdv another cause of liver disease no effective therapy exists to eradicate infection and it remains resistant even to recent regimens that have considerably changed the treatment of hbv ref  here we demonstrate longterm engraftment of primary human hepatocytes transplanted in a matrix under the kidney capsule of mice with administration of an agonistic antibody against cmet these mice were susceptible to hbv infection and completion of the viral life cycle in addition
