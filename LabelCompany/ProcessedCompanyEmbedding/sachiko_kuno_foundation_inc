knows the value of experimentation and innovation she and her research partnerhusband ryuji ueno made a fortune developing drugs to treat conditions such as glaucoma and irritable bowel syndrome but the biotech entrepreneurs – founders of sucampo pharmaceuticals inc in the united states and rtech ueno ltd in their native japan – also are deeply invested in finding formulas to improve society their laboratory for this philanthropic work is the yearold halcyon incubator a residential program housed in a beautifully renovated thcentury mansion in washington’s historic georgetown neighborhood kuno  calls halcyon an ecosystem for young social entrepreneurs to think about how they can  solve stcentury problems fellows’ interests range widely from starting a community solar project or a west african literacy program to eliminating carbon emissions or designing headphones that cancel motion sickness stimulating supportive environment they live and work at halcyon house for four months then get free office space for another eight months they meet with experts in marketing law and other fields – as well as potential funders they also get to enjoy some of the arts programing of halcyon’s parent sr foundation headquartered at the evermay estate another historic property several blocks away the couple bought both properties in  for a combined  million the foundation began an arts awards program in  and after evermay’s acquisition started a concert series there in   at halcyon you have an infrastructure said former fellow diana sierra of colombia you have the business plan you have the chance to pitch to other people and show them your project – get advice sierra developed the awardwinning be girl project which designs washable reusable feminine hygiene pads and panties menstruation can be a very simple thing for people who have access to proper management materials but if you don’t  it can be a burden sierra said unicef reports one in  girls skip school during their monthly periods – or even drop out – because they lack sanitation supplies or suffer teasing and embarrassment by talking with girls in uganda and other test markets sierra learned that water shortages meant the products had to be easy to clean be girl’s website also says its reusable products are more environmentally friendly than disposable pads and tampons  an encouraging presence no matter what the fellows focus kuno offers encouragement says amelia friedman who’s from the washington suburb of arlington virginia she’s like the fairy godmother of halcyon  she’s very careful to think about what’s the best way she can support us and our ventures said friedman who started the student language exchange as a brown university sophomore now it’s operating at six universities with native speakers teaching their peers languages such as bengali swahili and dzongkha  halcyon is really trying to bring together a diversity of people a diversity of ideas  to build a more vibrant community to improve society she said diversity embraced kuno appreciates the need for diversity in her s she was kyoto university’s only female phd candidate in industrial biochemistry which she said sometimes left her feeling isolated as if she herself were under a microscope kuno credits a professor for encouraging her to do postdoctoral research in germany at the technical university of munich where she could work among other women as well as men the experience in munich changed me to be more confident that what i am doing is correct she said her confidence grew and  years ago she switched from academics to applied science – to business forbes the business publication estimates her worth at  million and ranks her st on its current list of selfmade women in america for me business is a kind of tool yielding better things for society kuno said … i’m always focused on what will be the final goal kuno counts the sr foundation and its halcyon program as deeply satisfying ventures that repay others’ investments in her i was supported by many people when i was young and many people who believed in my talent and capability and potential she said so i just want to do the same thing for the next generation the scientistphilanthropist also hinted she may have still more future contributions of her own she likes to undertake a fresh challenge to initialize my life every seven eight years kuno said  i do not like to sit on what i have done already innovation awaits link to coverage   bizapediacom  human validation companiespeopleproductsservicestrademarksaddressesphone book our
