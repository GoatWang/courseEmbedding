june   and  unaudited note   business basis of presentation and significant accounting policies business hinto energy inc the company was incorporated in february   in the state of wyoming the company and its whollyowned subsidiary south uintah gas properties inc are involved in the acquisition and development of oil and gas prospects in the rocky mountain region the company has oil and gas leases wells and new drilling prospects in both utah and montana the companys fiscal year end is december st the companys financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting under gaap generally accepted accounting principles basis of presentation consolidation the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hinto energy inc and its wholly owned subsidiary south uintah gas properties inc collectively the company all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation interim presentation in the opinion of the management of the company the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all material adjustments including all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the financial position and operating results of the company for the periods presented the financial statements and notes do not contain certain information included in the companys financial statements for the year ended december   it is the companys opinion that when the interim financial statements are read in conjunction with the december   audited financial statements the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any future period note   significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents  property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is computed principally on the straightline method over the estimated useful life of each type of asset which ranges from five to seven years maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred improvements and betterments are capitalized upon retirement or disposition the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are credited or charged to income life in june  december  asset type years       machinery          subtotal   less accumulated depreciation      net book value        oil and gas properties full cost method the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties to drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells including directly related overhead costs and related asset retirement costs are capitalized under this method all costs including internal costs directly related to acquisition exploration and development activities are capitalized as oil and gas property costs properties not subject to amortization consist of exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a propertybyproperty basis amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties become proved or their values become impaired the company assesses the realization of unproved properties taken as a whole if any on at least an annual basis or when there has been an indication that impairment in value may have occurred impairment of unproved properties is assessed based on managements intention with regard to future exploration and development of individually significant properties and the ability of the company to obtain funds to finance such exploration and development if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized costs of oil and gas properties will be amortized using the units of production method the company performs a quarterly ceiling test calculation to test its oil and gas properties for possible impairment the primary components impacting this calculation are commodity prices reserve quantities added and produced overall development costs depletion expense and tax effects if the net capitalized cost of the companys oil and gas properties subject to amortization the carrying value exceeds the ceiling limitation the excess would be charged to expense the ceiling limitation is equal to the sum of the present value discounted at  of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves the cost of properties not being amortized the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized and all related tax effects at june   the calculated value of the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the companys oil and gas properties subject to the test and no impairment was necessary  impairment the company reviews longlived assets held for use principally oil and gas leases for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable impairment exists if the carrying amount of the longlived asset is not recoverable from the undiscounted cash flows expected from its use and eventual disposition we determine the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the longlived asset to its estimated fair value in the absence of quoted market prices we determine estimated fair value generally based on the present value of future probability weighted cash flows expected from the continued use and value at sale of the longlived asset revenue and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue for its production when the quantities are delivered to or collected by the purchaser prices for such production are generally defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices all transportation costs are included in lease operating expenses accounts receivable  oil and natural gas sales consist of uncollateralized accrued revenues due under normal trade terms generally requiring payment within  to  days of production the company reviews accounts receivable periodically and reduces the carrying amount by a valuation allowance that reflects its best estimate of the amount that may not be collectible no valuation allowance was recognized as of june   and december   dependence on major customers during the six months ended june   the companys revenues were attributable to sales of oil to two customers during the year ended december   the companys revenues were attributable to sales of oil to one customer the company believes that there are potential alternative purchasers and that it may be necessary to establish relationships with new purchasers however there can be no assurance that the company can establish such relationships and that those relationships will result in an increased number of purchasers although the company is exposed to a concentration of credit risk the company believes that all of its purchasers are credit worthy the company had no bad debt at june   and december   asset retirement obligations asset retirement obligations aros associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets are recognized as liabilities with an increase to the carrying amounts of the related longlived assets in the period incurred the cost of the tangible asset including the asset retirement cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset aros are recorded at estimated fair value measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligations discounted at the companys creditadjusted riskfree interest rate accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liabilities are accreted to their expected settlement value if estimated future costs of aros change an adjustment is recorded to both the aro and the longlived asset revisions to estimated aros can result from changes in retirement cost estimates revisions to estimated inflation rates and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment  net loss per share basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing the net loss applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period for the six and three months ended june   and  there were no potential common equivalent shares used in the calculation of weighted average common shares outstanding as the effect would be antidilutive because of the net loss stockbased compensation the company adopted the provisions of and accounts for stockbased compensation using an estimate of value in accordance with the fair value method under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which generally is the vesting period the company elected the modifiedprospective method under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes the valuation method applies to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified fair value of financial instruments the companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and notes payable are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturity of these instruments other comprehensive income the company has no material components of other comprehensive income loss and accordingly net loss is equal to comprehensive loss in all periods income taxes provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable on tax return filings each year deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measures the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected as adjustment to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment recent accounting pronouncements there were accounting standards and interpretations issued during the six months ended june   none of which are expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position operations or cash flows  note   going concern and managements plan the companys unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended june   and  have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business the company reported a net loss of  for the six months ended june    for the three months ended june   and an accumulated deficit of  as of june   the future success of the company is dependent on its ability to attract additional capital or to find an acquisition to add value to its present shareholders and ultimately upon its ability to develop future profitable operations there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such financing or that it will attain positive cash flow from operations management believes that actions presently being taken to revise the companys operating and financial requirements provide the opportunity for the company to continue as a going concern note   oil and gas leases oil and gas properties consisted of the following as of june  december      proved properties    unproved properties         accumulated depletion

may continue to adversely affect the company in its attempt to obtain financing or in its process to produce commercially feasible oil and gas production federal state and local authorities regulate the oil and gas industry in particular gas and oil production operations and economics are affected by environmental protection statutes tax statutes and other laws and regulations relating to the petroleum industry as well as changes in such laws changing administrative regulations and the interpretations and application of such laws rules and regulations the company believes it is in compliance with all federal state and local laws regulations and orders applicable to the company and its properties and operations the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on the company or its financial condition operating hazards and insurance the gas and oil business involves a variety of operating risks including the risk of fire explosions blowouts pipe failure abnormally pressured formation and environmental hazards such as oil spills gas leaks ruptures or discharges of toxic gases the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to the company due to injury or loss of life severe damage to or destruction of property natural resources and equipment pollution or other environmental damage cleanup responsibilities regulatory investigation and

adequate to cover any losses or exposure to liability although the company believes that the policies obtained by the third party operators provide coverage in scope and in amounts customary in the industry they do not provide complete coverage against all operating risks an uninsured or partially insured claim if successful and of significant magnitude could have a material adverse effect on the company and its financial condition via its contractual liability to the prospect  title to properties the companys practice has been to acquire ownership or leasehold rights to oil and natural gas properties from third parties most of the companys current operations are conducted on properties acquired from third parties our existing rights are dependent on those previous third parties having obtained valid title to the properties prior to the commencement of gas drilling operations on those properties the third parties customarily conduct a title examination the company generally does not conduct examinations of title prior to obtaining its interests in its operations but rely on representations from the third parties that they have good valid and enforceable title to the oil and gas properties based upon the foregoing we believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with customary practices in the gas industry the company is not aware

working capital need for additional financing we do not have capital sufficient to meet our cash needs we will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs once exploration commences our needs for additional financing is likely to increase substantially no commitments to provide additional funds have been made by our management or other stockholders accordingly there can be no assurance that any additional funds will be available to us to allow it to cover our expenses as they may be incurred critical accounting policies cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less and money market instruments to be cash equivalents oil and gas properties full cost method the company uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities costs to acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties to drill and equip exploratory wells used to find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells including directly related overhead costs and related asset retirement costs are capitalized under this method all costs including internal costs directly related to acquisition exploration and development activities are capitalized as oil and gas property costs properties not subject to amortization consist of exploration and development costs which are evaluated on a propertybyproperty basis amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties become proved or their values become impaired the company assesses the realization of unproved properties taken as a whole if any on at least an annual basis or when there has been an indication that impairment in value may have occurred impairment of unproved properties is assessed based on managements intention with regard to future exploration and development of individually significant properties and the ability of the company to obtain funds to finance such exploration and development if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized costs of oil and gas properties will be amortized using the units of production method in applying the full cost method the company will perform an impairment test ceiling test at each reporting date whereby the carrying value of property and equipment is compared to the estimated present value of its proved reserves discounted at a percent interest rate of future net revenues based on current economic and operating conditions plus the cost of properties not being amortized plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties included in costs being amortized less the income tax effects related to book and tax basis differences of the properties if capitalized costs exceed this limit the excess is charged as an impairment expense  revenue and accounts receivable the company recognizes revenue for its production when the quantities are delivered to or collected by the purchaser prices for such production are generally defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices all transportation costs are included in lease operating expenses accounts receivable  oil and natural gas sales consist of uncollateralized accrued revenues due under normal trade terms generally requiring payment within  to  days of production the company reviews accounts receivable periodically and reduces the carrying amount by a valuation allowance that reflects its best estimate of the amount that may not be collectible no valuation allowance was recognized as of june   and december   dependence on major customers during the six months ended june   the companys revenues were attributable to sales of oil to two customers during the year ended december   the companys revenues were attributable to sales of oil to one customer the company believes that there are potential alternative purchasers and that it may be necessary to establish relationships with new purchasers however there can be no assurance that the company can establish such relationships and that those relationships will result in an increased number of purchasers although the company is exposed to a concentration of credit risk the company believes that all of its purchasers are credit worthy the company had no bad debt at june   and december   item  quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable item  controls and procedures disclosures controls and procedures we have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules a e and de under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods required under the secs rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management including our chief financial officer principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure as required by sec rule db our chief financial officer carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to exchange act rule d as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the foregoing evaluation and the evaluation conducted at june   our chief financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting management them to material information required to be included in our periodic sec filings and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic sec filings is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure  managements report on internal control over financial reporting hintos management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance with as defined in rules af and df under the exchange act the companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the companys assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of hintos management and directors and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on hintos financial statements we have identified certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting relating to a shortage of accounting and reporting personnel due to limited financial resources and the size of our company as detailed below  the company currently does not have but is in the process of developing formally documented accounting policies and procedures which includes establishing a welldefined process for financial reporting  due to the limited size of our accounting department we currently lack the resources to handle complex accounting transactions we believe this deficiency could lead to errors in the presentation and disclosure of financial information in our annual quarterly and other filings  as is the case with many companies of similar size we currently lack segregation of duties in the accounting department until our operations expand and additional cash flow is generated from operations a complete segregation of duties within our accounting function will not be possible considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations and the fact that we have been a small business with limited employees such items caused a weakness in internal controls involving the areas disclosed above we have concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective as of june   due to the existence of the material weaknesses noted above that we have yet to fully remediate there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended june   that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting  part

its products thus far in order to enter the market global gard inc has to successfully implement its plan of operations which is dependent on the success of this offering we believe that once we are able to develop our products we could offer our apps at an affordable price however there is no certainty that we will be able to develop our apps or even if we could offer them at an affordable price we will be competing against already established companies and all the emerging app companies the emergency or distress use of cellular technology has existed for a number of years in both dedicated hardware and software the dedicated hardware market has a range of phones designed for children and seniors that have dedicated buttons for emergency purposes these phones range in price from  dollars to over  dollars the company feels that its software application will be more desirable in the over  year old to the under yearold market than the dedicated phones the company’s application will be designed to operate on the most popular existing cell phones that our target market will already own plus as our application will be more affordable than the dedicated phones the emergency smart phone software industry has been around for a number of years with one of the most popular programs being guardly ™ that started operations in  guardly’s product line has multiple applications for specific situations in contrast gg app will provide many of the same features in a single application and will offer a single more robust application the company’s second application allowing for secure voice and messaging will be entering an established market with competitors like silent circle ™ the company’s planned price of  per month for its application is  less than the basic fee charged by silent circle the company feels that its’ pricing will be its most distinguishing market feature and competitive advantage” company description global gard inc gg was incorporated in the state of nevada as a forprofit company on july   we are a developmentstage company that intends to develop security applications for smartphones apps we have not yet developed any app our first app to be developed is called ggapp intended to be used in dangerous situations and moments of panic or distress our tobedeveloped app would alert the user’s family and friends observers in possible moments of danger it may also be used to call emergency services such as the police fire department or medical services we plan to develop two modes of operation “stealth mode” and “caution mode” the company anticipates that it will not be able to offer the global guard application through the apple’s apps store as the company’s application will require its users to jail break their iphones the company anticipates it will be able to offer its ggapp on the google play store as android phones will not need to be jail broken and or rooted once ggapp has been activated in the stealth mode the user cannot deactivate it only the company for a fee can terminate it to terminate the application the user will have to call into the company and pay a  contingent on the sale of at least  of the shares offered herein we also intend to develop a second app the ggapp encriptor this app is planned to encrypt all data exchanged by internet wifi g and g and phone conversations the objective is to prevent stolen passwords and data obtained by internet connection on untrusted wifi connections we intend to sell ggapp on google play and for download on our website for us  also we plan on offering a trial version of ggapp encriptor for a month and after this period this app can be used for monthly payment of us the global guard encryption application can be sold in both the apple apps store and the google play store as its use will not require its users to jail break their smart phones global gard inc has no plans to change its business activities or partner with another business and is not aware of any
