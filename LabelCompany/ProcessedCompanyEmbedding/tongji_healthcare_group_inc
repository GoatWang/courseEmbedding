debt allowance of approximately  and  as of june   and december              tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements june   unaudited   fair value of financial instruments   the company applies the provisions of fasb asc topic  which requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet for which it is practicable to estimate fair value and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties as of june   and december   the fair value of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses notes payable and other payables approximated the carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates except for related party debt or receivables for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value   fair value measurements   fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements   various inputs are considered when determining the fair value of the company’s investments and longterm debt the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below   ●   level  – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets ●   level  – other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates credit risk etc ●   level  – significant unobservable inputs including the company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments   the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared the company had no financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis   the availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction for many financial instruments pricing inputs are readily observable in the market the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants and the valuation does not require significant management discretion for other financial instruments pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment   concentrations risks and uncertainties   all of the company’s operations are located in the prc there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully continue to operate and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the success of the company’s operations is subject to numerous contingencies some of which are beyond management’s control these contingencies include general economic conditions the price of medicine competition governmental and political conditions and changes in regulations because the company is dependent on the domestic market of the prc the company is subject to various additional political economic and other uncertainties among other risks the company’s operations will be subject to risk of restrictions on the transfer of funds domestic policy changes changing taxation policies foreign exchange restrictions and political and governmental regulations          tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements june   unaudited   contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued these conditions may result in a future loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed   medical supplies   medical supplies include both western and traditional chinese medicine are valued on the lower of weighted average cost or market basis inventory includes product cost and inbound freight management compares the cost of medical supplies with the market value and allowance is made for writing down their inventories to market value if such value is lower   equipment   equipment is recorded at cost depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the straightline method maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized when equipment is disposed the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income or expenses   constructioninprogress   a hospital facility currently under development is accounted for as constructioninprogress constructioninprogress is recorded at acquisition cost including land rights cost development expenditure and professional fees capitalized during the course of construction for the purpose of financing the project upon completion of the project the cost of constructioninprogress will be transferred to fixed assets at which time depreciation will commence   capitalization of interest   interest cost is capitalized for qualifying assets when the portion of the interest cost incurred during the assets acquisition periods could have been avoided if expenditures for the assets had not been made the amount capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying the capitalization rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period the capitalization rates used in an accounting period is based on the rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period also see note    capitalization period covers the duration of the activities required to get the asset ready for its intended use provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost is being incurred interest capitalization continues as long as those activities and the incurrence of interest cost continue             tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements june   unaudited     impairment of longlived assets   the company’s longlived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of fasb topic asc  “property plant and equipment” and fasb asc topic  “presentation of financial statements” the company tests for impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable whenever any such impairment exists an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value   the company tests longlived assets for recoverability at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than its fair value assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows the company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments the company estimates fair value based on the information available in making whatever estimates judgments and projections are considered necessary there was no impairment of longlived assets for the six months ended june   and    basic and diluted earnings per share   earnings per share eps is calculated in accordance with the fasb asc topic  “earnings per share” basic net income loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net income loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period potentially dilutive securities to purchase  shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share as their effect would be antidilutive for the six months ended june   during the six month period ended june   the average market price of the common stock was less than the exercise price of the stock options and the company was in net loss position accordingly the stock options were antidilutive and have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share

financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   in accordance with asc topic  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb asc topic ”         which requires income tax positions to meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met   the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation the evolution of regulations and court rulings therefore the actual liability may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset valuation allowance            tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated

companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare services for patients with health insurance medicare and medicaid patients also receive reduced rates functionally the patient is billed for health services at the higher rate normally charged to patients without insurance the amount billed is then reduced by the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference sometimes known as the contractual allowance between the normal rate for the services and the reduced rate that the hospital estimates it will receive from medicare medicaid and insurance companies   for financial reporting purposes hospitals in the united states record revenues based upon established billing rates less adjustment for contractual allowances revenues are recorded based upon the amounts due from the

allowances under thirdparty payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements thirdparty payer contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis per diem rates or discounted feeforservice rates   due to the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of thirdparty payers which are often subject to interpretation the reimbursement actually received by us hospitals for health care services is sometimes different from their estimates

reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon regulations promulgated by these government agencies we bill the medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients covered by these medicare programs in addition due to the fact that rates are established by the government there is no difference between rates for patients covered by medicare and patients who pay cash   since we only deal with the nanning municipal and the guangxi provincial medicare agencies we are familiar with their regulations pertaining to reimbursements as a result there is normally no material difference between

periodic reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   as of june   our management under the supervision of and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by rules ab and db under the exchange act based upon this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of june   as a result of the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting which are discussed below our management considers our internal control over financial reporting to be an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures   specifically our management identified certain matters involving internal control and our operations that it considered to be material weaknesses as defined in the exchange act a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrants annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses identified by our management as of june   are described below     ● we did not design implement or maintain effective entitylevel controls related to our control environment resulting in the following significant control deficiencies     o the code of business conduct and ethics which was specifically designed for public company applicability has yet to be formally acknowledged by members of management and the finance department     o there is an absence of independence and financial expertise on the board of directors and we do not have an audit committee or a formalized internal audit function limiting its ability to provide effective oversight of our management     o the full implementation of and related training for our newlyformalized it policies and procedures were still in process at yearend accordingly we lacked sufficientlytrained personnel to provide for adequate segregation of duties within the accounting system and effective oversight of controls over access change data and security management    planned remediation as financial conditions permit we plan to take the following actions to improve our internal control over financial reporting     ● require all members of our management and the finance department across all corporate entities to certify receipt of the revised code of business conduct and ethics by signature signed copies will be retained by our management thereafter our management plans to periodically require signatories to acknowledge that they understand the contents of the code of business conduct and ethics and whether they are aware of anyone in our company that might have violated some part of the code          item  controls and procedures  continued     ● recruit an independent financial expert to the board of directors to chair an audit committee and formalize roles and responsibilities over our internal control over financial reporting for the board and our management our management also plans to develop and implement a formal corporate internal audit capability reporting directly to an independent audit committee to provide effective oversight of our internal control over financial reporting     ● continue to engage the services of qualified consultants with china gaap us gaap and sec reporting experience to support our financial reporting and sox compliance requirements including assistance with the following     o remediating identified material weaknesses     o monitoring our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis     o managing our periodend financial closing and reporting processes and     o identifying and resolving nonroutine or complex accounting matters     ● complete the implementation of and related training for its it policies and procedures related to access change data and security management to ensure that all relevant financial information is secure identified captured processed and reported within the accounting system and spreadsheets supporting financial reporting     ● continue providing training to accounting personnel regarding our significant policies and procedures related to accounting finance and internal control to ensure that financial reporting competencies are strengthened   our management will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as well as its internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional improvements as necessary and as funds allow however our management cannot guarantee that the measures taken or any future measures will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting   notwithstanding the material weaknesses described above our management believes that there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact and to the best of its knowledge believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report present fairly in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states   changes in internal control

consolidation   these financial statements present the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows on a consolidated basis the consolidated financial statements include the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation our policy is to consolidate all subsidiaries in which a greater than  voting interest is owned and all variable interest entities to which we had a variable interest and effectively control the entity the company operates in one segment in accordance with the accounting guidance fasb asc topic  “segment reporting”   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of the statements of cash flows the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents a substantial amount of the company’s cash is held in bank accounts in the prc and is not protected by federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance or any other similar insurance cash held in china amounted to  as of march   given the current economic environment and the financial condition of the banking industry there is a risk that the deposits may not be readily available or covered by such insurance the company has had no loss of cash in domestic or foreign banks in past years   use of estimates   the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material the more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others useful lives and residual values of fixed assets valuation of inventories accounts receivable stock based compensation and allowance for bad debt the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions   translation adjustment   the companys functional currency is the chinese renminbi rmb the reporting currency is that of the us dollar capital accounts of the consolidated financial statements are translated into united states dollars from rmb at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date income and expenditures are translated at the average exchange rate of the year the rmb is not freely convertible into foreign currency and all foreign currency exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been or could be converted into us dollar at the rates used in translation   the exchange rates used to translate amounts in rmb into usd for the purposes of preparing the financial statements were as follows   march     balance sheet rmb  to us  statement of income and other comprehensive income rmb  to us      december     balance sheet rmb  to us  statement of income and other comprehensive income rmb  to us    march     balance

note  summary of significant accounting policies  continued   reclassifications   certain items previously reported under specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation   revenue recognition   the companys revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin  asc  service revenue is recognized on the dates services were rendered when a formal arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable when the service is completed no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue   the company generates revenue from individual patients as well as thirdparty payers including prc government programs and insurance providers under which the hospital is paid based upon government established charges revenues for pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient   patient revenues are recorded based on preestablished rates set by the local government the company bills for services provided to medicare patients through a medical card the us equivalent of an insurance card there have not been significant differences between the amounts the company has billed the government medicare funds and the amounts collected from the medicare funds   accounts receivable   accounts receivable are recorded at the estimated net realizable amounts from government fund insurance companies and patients collections have not been considered an area that exposes the company to additional risk hospital staff verifies patient coverage prior to examinations andor procedures   for any medicare patient who visits the hospital and is qualified for acceptance the hospital will only include the portion that the social insurance organization will pay in the accounts receivable and collects the selfpay portion in cash at the time of service management continues to estimate the likelihood of bad debt on an ongoing basis   the company has estimated a bad debt allowance of approximately  as of march   and  as of december     fair value of financial instruments   the company applies the provisions of fasb asc topic  which requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet for which it is practicable to estimate fair value and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties as of march   and december   the fair value of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable other current receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses settlement payable capital lease payable and other payables approximated the carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates except for related party debt or receivables for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value   fair value measurements   fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements   various inputs are considered when determining the fair value of the company’s investments and longterm debt the inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in these securities these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below          tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements march   unaudited   note  summary of significant accounting policies  continued     · level  – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   · level  – other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates credit risk etc   · level  – significant unobservable inputs including the company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments   the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value is measured on a recurring or nonrecurring basis financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs the company had no financial assets or liabilities carried and measured on a nonrecurring basis during the reporting periods financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared the company had no financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis   the availability of inputs observable in the market varies from instrument to instrument and depends on a variety of factors including the type of instrument whether the instrument is actively traded and other characteristics particular to the transaction for many financial instruments pricing inputs are readily observable in the market the valuation methodology used is widely accepted by market participants and the valuation does not require significant management discretion for other financial instruments pricing inputs are less observable in the market and may require management judgment   concentrations risks and uncertainties   all of the company’s operations are located in the prc there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully continue to operate and failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the success of the company’s operations is subject to numerous contingencies some of which are beyond management’s control these contingencies include general economic conditions the price of medicine competition governmental and political conditions and changes in regulations because the company is dependent on the domestic market of the prc the company is subject to various additional political economic and other uncertainties among other risks the company’s operations will be subject to risk of restrictions on the transfer of funds domestic policy changes changing taxation policies foreign exchange restrictions and political and governmental regulations   contingencies   certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued these conditions may result in a future loss to the company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur the company’s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings the company’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought   if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued if the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees in which case the guarantee would be disclosed   medical supplies   medical supplies include both western and traditional chinese medicine are valued on the lower of weighted average cost or market basis inventory includes product cost and inbound freight management compares the cost of medical supplies with the market value and allowance is made for writing down their inventories to market value if such value is lower          tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements march   unaudited   note  summary of significant accounting policies  continued   equipment   equipment is recorded at cost depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the related asset type using the straightline method maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and the costs of additions and betterments that increase the useful lives of the assets are capitalized when equipment is disposed the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in other income or expenses   impairment of longlived assets   the company’s longlived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the guidance of fasb topic asc  “property plant and equipment” and fasb asc topic  “presentation of financial statements” the company tests for impairment losses on longlived assets used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable whenever any such impairment exists an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value   the company tests longlived assets for recoverability at least annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than its fair value assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows the company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments the company estimates fair value based on the information available in making whatever estimates judgments and projections are considered necessary there was no impairment of longlived assets for the three months ended march   and    basic and diluted earnings per share   earnings per share eps is calculated in accordance with the fasb asc topic  “earnings per share” basic net income loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net income loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method under this method options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period or at the time of issuance if later and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period potentially dilutive securities to purchase  shares of common stock were not included in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share as their effect would be antidilutive for the three months ended march   during the three month period ended march   the average market price of the common stock was less than the exercise price of the stock options and the company was in net loss position accordingly the stock options were antidilutive and have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share   income taxes   fasb asc topic  income taxes” requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized   in accordance with asc topic  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb asc topic ”    which requires income tax positions to meet a morelikelythannot recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met          tongji healthcare group inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements march   unaudited   note  summary of significant accounting policies  continued   the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy changes in legislation the evolution of regulations and court rulings therefore the actual liability may be materially different from our estimates which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset valuation allowance    the company has made a comprehensive review of its portfolio of tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by asc  and has not recognized any material uncertain tax positions   in addition companies in the prc are required to pay business taxes consisting of  of income they derive from providing medical treatment as well as city construction taxes and educational taxes which are  and  respectively of the business taxes in april  the company was granted an exemption from these taxes until further notice from the tax bureau   the company had accrued approximately  under taxes payable account for failure to file us tax

materially from those projected in the forwardlooking statements   overview   nanning tongji hospital inc nth or “tongji hospital” was established in nanning city guangxi province of the peoples’ republic of china prc by the guangxi tongji medical co ltd and an individual on october     nth is a designated hospital for medical insurance in city of nanning and guangxi province nth specializes in the areas of internal medicine surgery gynecology pediatrics emergency medicine ophthalmology medical cosmetology rehabilitation dermatology otolaryngology traditional chinese medicine medical imaging anesthesia acupuncture physical therapy health examination and prevention   on december   we through our whollyowned subsidiary tongji inc a colorado company acquired  of the equity in nth pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger we issued  shares of common stock to the shareholders of nth in exchange for  of the issued and outstanding shares of nth accordingly nth became a wholly owned subsidiary of tongji inc we have been in the business of operating hospitals and providing healthcare services in nanning guangxi province of the prc   the acquisition of nth was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since the shareholders of nth obtained control of the consolidated entity accordingly the reorganization of the two companies was recorded as a recapitalization of nth we treated nth as the continuing operating entity  we have two sources of operating revenues inpatient service revenues and outpatient service revenues in addition to provide services to our patients we also sell pharmaceutical drugs to our patients revenues from such sales are included in either our inpatient service revenues or our outpatient service revenues our revenues come from individuals as well as thirdparty payers including prc government programs and insurance providers under which the hospital is paid based upon local government established charges revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients or thirdparty payers revenues from pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient or at the time a prescription by a registered physician is filled   patient revenues are recorded based on preestablished rates set by the local government the company bills for services provided to medicare patients through a medical card the us equivalent of an insurance card historically there have been no significant differences between the amounts the company has billed the government medicare funds and the amounts collected from the medicare funds   the company had two major customers for the three month period ended march   and  nanning social insurance center and china ums nanning social insurance center accounted for  and  of revenue for the three month period ended march   and  respectively china ums accounted for  and  of revenue for the three month period

month period ended march   the rest are from around  different suppliers one of the former suppliers guangxi tongji medicine co ltd is a related company that our chief executive officer controls and accounted for  of our total purchases for the three month period ended march     in march  we sold our constructioninprogress hospital building to guangxi yida friendship hospital management inc for

of  in  as of march   we received payment amount of  whereas no payment received during the first quarter of  we incurred valueadded tax vat and other taxes liability of rmb  approximately  related to this transaction the amount is included in other payables          item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued   difference in the medical system between the us and china   in the united states most hospitals have contracts with health insurance companies that provide reduced rates for healthcare services for patients with health insurance medicare and medicaid patients also receive reduced rates functionally the patient is billed for health services at the higher rate normally charged to patients without insurance the amount billed is then reduced by the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference sometimes known as the contractual allowance between the normal rate for the services and the reduced rate that the hospital estimates it will receive from medicare medicaid an d insurance companies   for financial reporting purposes hospitals in the united states record revenues based upon established billing rates less adjustment for contractual allowances revenues are recorded based upon the amounts due from the patients and thirdparty payers including federal and state agencies under the medicare and medicaid programs managed care health plans health insurance companies and employers estimates of contractual allowances under thirdparty payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements thirdparty payer contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis per diem rates or discounted feeforservice rates   due to the complexities involved in determining amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of thirdparty payers which are often subject to interpretation the reimbursement actually received by us hospitals for health care services is sometimes different from their estimates   the medical system in the prc is different from that in the united states private medical insurance is not generally available to the prc’s population and as a result services and medications provided by our hospital are usually paid by cash or by the medicare agencies of the nanning municipal government and the guangxi provincial government our billing system automatically calculates the reimbursements that we are entitled to base upon regulations promulgated by theses government agencies we bill the medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients covered by these medicare programs in addition due to the fact that rates are established by the government there is no difference between rates for patients covered by medicare and patients who pay cash   since we only deal with the nanning municipal and the guangxi provincial medicare agencies we are familiar with their regulations pertaining to reimbursements as a result there is normally no material difference between the amounts we bill and the amounts we receive for services provided to medicare patients   results of operation  three months ended march   and    material changes of items in our statement of operations for the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   are discussed below   operating revenues  – operating revenue for the three month period ended march   which resulted primarily from inpatient services and outpatient services was  a decrease of  or  as compared with the operating revenue of  for the same period of  our inpatient service revenue was  for the three month period ended march   as compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  or  the decrease in the inpatient service revenue was primarily due to reduced revenue from our inpatient ophthalmology department our outpatient service revenue was  for the three month period ended march   a decrease of  or  as compared to  for the same period in  the decrease in the outpatient service revenue was primarily due to the closure of personnel medical care department and resignation of doctors from our outpatient department since second quarter of  resulting in fewer patients being treated    operating expenses  – operating expenses were  for the three month period ended march   a decrease of  as compared to  for the same period of  which is in line with the decrease in our operating revenues   loss from operations   operating loss was  for the three month period ended march   an increase of  or as compared to an operating loss of  for the same period of  the primary reason for the increase in loss from operations is the decline in operating revenues   interest expense –  interest expense for the three month period ended march   was  as compared to  for the three month period ended march   a slight increase of  or     net loss   as a result of the forgoing the company had a net loss of  during the quarter ended march   compared to a net loss of  for the comparative period in  an increase of  or           item  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued   trends events and uncertainties   the china ministry of health as well as other related agencies has proposed changes to the prices we can charge for medical services drugs and medications we cannot predict the impact of these proposed changes since the changes are not fully defined and we do not know whether those proposed changes will ever be implemented or when they may take effect   in march  nanning tongji hospital inc sold its construction in progress hospital building to guangxi yida friendship

for these acquisitions and we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock debt financing or other arrangements we do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital additional capital may not be available to us or if available on acceptable terms in which case we would not be able to acquire other hospitals or

additional capital we may be forced to cease operations and liquidate   operating activities   net cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net loss as adjusted by depreciation stock option and changes in noncash working capital items such as accounts receivable medical supplies capital lease deposits prepaid expense and other current assets accounts payables and accrued liabilities  and other payables   net cash used in operating activities was  for the three months ended march   a decrease of  or  as compared with the net cash provided by operating activities of  for the same period in  the decrease in net cash provided in operating activities was primarily due to the reduced revenue resulting in a  increase in net loss   investing activities   net cash used in investing activities was for the three months ended march   a decrease of  or  as compared with the net cash used in investing activities of  for the same period in  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to disposal of construction in progress in  resulting reduced cash contribution in the current period    financing activities   net cash provided by financing activities primarily consists of proceeds from related party loans   net cash provided by financing activities was  for the three months ended march   a decrease of  or  as compared with the net cash

officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by rules ab and db under the exchange act based upon this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of march   as a result of the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting which are discussed below our management considers our internal control over financial reporting to be an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures   specifically our management identified certain matters involving internal control and our operations that it considered to be material weaknesses as defined in the exchange act a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrants annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses identified by our management as of march   are described below          item  controls and procedures  continued     ● we did not design implement or maintain effective entitylevel controls related to our control environment resulting in the following significant control deficiencies     o the code of business conduct and ethics which was specifically designed for public company applicability has yet to be formally acknowledged by members of management and the finance department     o there is an absence of independence and financial expertise on the board of directors and we do not have an audit committee or a formalized internal audit function limiting its ability to provide effective oversight of our management     o the full implementation of and related training for our newlyformalized it policies and procedures were still in process at yearend accordingly we lacked sufficientlytrained personnel to provide for adequate segregation of duties within the accounting system and effective oversight of controls over access change data and security management   our management believes that the pervasive nature of these control deficiencies when aggregated impact all significant accounts and disclosures and rise to the level of material weakness    planned remediation   as financial conditions permit we plan to take the following actions to improve our internal control over financial reporting     ● require all members of our management and the finance department across all corporate entities to certify receipt of the revised code of business conduct and ethics by signature signed copies will be retained by our management thereafter our management plans to periodically require signatories to acknowledge that they understand the contents of the code of business conduct and ethics and whether they are aware of anyone in our company that might have violated some part of the code     ● recruit an independent financial expert to the board of directors to chair an audit committee and formalize roles and responsibilities over our internal control over financial reporting for the board and our management our management also plans to develop and implement a formal corporate internal audit capability reporting directly to an independent audit committee to provide effective oversight of our internal control over financial reporting     ● continue to engage the services of qualified consultants with china gaap us gaap and sec reporting experience to support our financial reporting and sox compliance requirements including assistance with the following     o remediating identified material weaknesses     o monitoring our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis     o managing our periodend financial closing and reporting processes and     o identifying and resolving nonroutine or complex accounting matters     ● complete the implementation of and related training for its it policies and procedures related to access change data and security management to ensure that all relevant financial information is secure identified captured processed and reported within the accounting system and spreadsheets supporting financial reporting     ● continue providing training to accounting personnel regarding our
