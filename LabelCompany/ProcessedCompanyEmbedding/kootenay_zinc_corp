announces further updates on sully projectmarketwiredmarch  reblogsharetweetsharevancouver british columbiamarketwired  mar    kootenay zinc corp the company cseznkznkcnktnnfkyhf is pleased to announce that its sully project team has recently completed a structural review of a portion of drill hole sy specifically core recovered in the modeled position of the e gravity mass of the east target was assessed as described in previous news the hole did not intersect an extensive mass in this position but did intersect a number of geologically significant features with similarities to the sullivan sedimentary environmentoriented core was obtained while drilling that allowed structural orientations of planar features such as bedding cleavage veins faults and dikes the core and the feature must be reasonably intact to achieve an orientation the data collected and logged in sy within the e zone of interest forms the basis for the following structural reviewat hole depths corresponding to the projected e gravity anomaly several gougefilled faults and broken zones are noted the gouge zones range from  to  cm thick some with associated core loss however it was noted the faults are commonly developed parallel to cleavage dipping about  degrees wnw bedding above and below this interval is generally uniform and typically overturned throughout the zone bedding is tightly folded and is repeatedly offset on cleavage planes the folds appear to be symmetric indicating a larger scale foldflexure developed across the entire zone of interest movement during folding caused rocks at higher levels to be shifted east of rocks below them on reversetype faultsbecause the strata are steep to overturned the offsets would have created gaps or fault windows and it is possible that sy passed from west of the zone of interest and above such a fault to east of it below the fault this structural possibility will continue to be evaluated as it provides an explanation that the e gravity anomaly is in proximity to the recently completed drill holemodeling and interpretation of all the new geological and geophysical data is intended to assist in determining where and at what depth the e anomaly is likely to be found the location and orientation of the next drill hole will be based on this information the project team is also currently completing its review and modeling of new ground mag survey data recently collected over much of the extent of the gravity anomalies and of fillin gravity data in the e anomaly area the results of that work will be reported shortlyabout

znk summary of our research findings we begin coverage of kootenay zinc corp with an investment opportunity score of ‘high’ based on our investment factors asset opportunity and team we cover these areas in our report below the company trades in the us under symbol ktnnf and in canada under znk kootenay zinc is a mineral exploration and development company presently targeting the sully project located just over  miles km east of the worldclass sullivan mine in british columbia from which more the  billion of zinc lead and silver were mined for almost a decade zinc was the allstar base metal during  due to continued strong demand and constrained supply while zinc prices have come off during the first part of  prices remain near historic highs with significant signs of a continuing demandsupply imbalance early drill results at sully perceived as negative by the market caused the price of the common shares to dip we believe investors should closely analyze all the data as a whole as there are certainly positive indications the work program on the property is being conducted now to prove out the asset we believe further drill data should become available over the next  to  days that if positive could easily move the price of the shares significantly higher investors should also note the highly experienced geological team on board including several who were intimately involved at sullivan which was one of the world’s premier zinc mines we are eagerly awaiting results from the current drill program to better define the anomalies present at the sully property kootenay zinc corp – a mining stock also for nonmining stock investors at global small caps we usually steer away from mining companies and mining stocks especially those classified as “junior miners” which are companies past the initial prospecting phase and mainly involved in assessing the value of a particular property initially identified as promising these junior mining companies usually need to raise relatively significant amounts of capital in order to fund the geophysics drilling sampling assaying testing and governmentalenvironmental permitting that are required once a junior mining company successfully raises the necessary capital and proves out the reserves the entire operation is often sold or otherwise taken over by another mining company that actually digs the assets out of the ground our cautionary view on most resource companies is based on the need for capital funding which is often found to be excessive and the risk to be extremely high compared to other areas where riskaverse small investors the typical readers of our reports can place capital when we were introduced to kootenay zinc corp at first we were a bit hesitant however upon initial analysis we quickly learned that we didn’t have to be experts in the analysis of junior miners in order to understand the opportunity that is in front of the company we think there is a very interesting opportunity relative to the company that is rather simple to understand for both the experienced mining operation investor and those who are less versed in the intricacies of the sector we are intrigued by the significant similarities of the company’s sully project which management is working to develop when compared to the once highly lucrative sullivan mine which is only  miles away while drilling data thus far have not proven the extent of the mineralization the results have not been completely disappointing as it appears the initial work program not only pointed to similar geological features as sullivan but also provided the company with valuable information to further its drilling efforts also very interesting are the prospects for kootenay relative to the overall market dynamics of the zinc market analysts who in  predicted supply constraints with continued strong demand were right on target while zinc prices dipped in  zinc led the basic metals market very significantly in  the fundamentals of the zinc market appear to be very sound and while more supply is already coming online prices remain near longterm highs we believe that even with a continuation of zinc price drops that have been seen thus far in  the overall market dynamics for the metal appears to be strong especially considering the oftenforecasted reduction in chinese gdp has failed to materialize it’s also exciting to see such an experienced advisory and scientific team on board several of the members are leaders in the mining industry and all have significant experience noteworthy in our opinion is that several team members have specific experience at sullivan and with its geology simply put we believe a junior mining operation oriented toward zinc would have a difficult time finding a more experienced team the product – zinc zinc is one of the major “base metals” along with copper aluminum steel tin and lead these metals are vital to virtually every economy throughout the world as all are major inputs used in manufacturing construction and production zinc is vitally important to most of our lives although most consumers and investors likely hear a lot less about zinc compared to the other base metals exhibit one – zinc in its raw form source us department of the interior as is outlined in exhibit two the most important use of zinc is as an additive or coating to resist corrosion of other metals the process of galvanizing metals to prevent corrosion is heavily reliant on zinc and plays an important part in most construction and transportation related industries while more than half of all mined zinc is used in galvanizing there are many other industrial processes that rely on the metal these include diecasting the production of brass which is a combination of zinc and copper and as an additive to paints and fertilizers exhibit two – major uses of zinc   source ilzsg the recent zinc market – a hotbed of activity in early  one of the hot topics in the metals market was the looming shortage of zinc the investment premise at that time was that a constrained supply combined with growing demand would result in shortages and significantly rising prices in fact while demand remained strong in  supply was constrained with several large zinc mine closures including the mega century mining operation in australia   by mid zinc was at a threeyear high and demand was such that the amount of zinc being pulled out of the ground began to lag demand by the first quarter of  the prediction made one year previously came to fruition the predicted shortage began to materialize as the effects of the australian mines closures hit the supply chain and as several irish mines made final shipments and closed operations by mid the metals analysts continued their optimistic forecasts for zinc predicting further supplydemand imbalances to continue for at least several more years while the analysts correctly predicted the constrained supply they didn’t necessarily get it right relative to pricing much of the anticipated rally in zinc prices failed to materialize during  as demand from many critical zincdependent industries lagged exhibit three – zinc prices in  – supply constrained but prices fall as demand lags   source kitcometalscom while zinc prices plummeted for almost the entire last nine months of  as is outlined in exhibit three at the beginning of  there was a rapid turnaround in the zinc market weakness in the us dollar caused a rally in virtually the entire metals sector while several other metals were not able to sustain the rally the situation relative to zinc was very different as the supply situation grew even tighter pentup demand from major industries in india and china hit the limited supply which resulted in significantly higher prices as outlined in exhibit four the surge during november  was particularly pronounced with prices by the end of that month gaining  over the january   price by the end of  with prices up  on the year it became obvious that many of the analyst predictions of constrained supply and robust demand that had they made two years earlier were right on the money the period of january   through the end of april  saw an additional  jump in the spot price of zinc exhibit four – the zinc rally of  lead the basic metals markets source london metals market while zinc prices have pulled back from the lofty levels of january  many believe the supplydemand imbalance will continue for the foreseeable future much of the decline in early  had nothing to do with the actual supplydemand situation but was attributable to concerns that the booming price would attract more supply onto the marketplace while there had been many mine closures during the previous threeyear period several major mining operations were still operating below theoretical capacity additionally during of the first quarter of  there has been significant discussion about the strength of industries that are major consumers of zinc longterm demand for the metal still seems robust in many people’s opinion with the infrastructure and construction markets taking up over  of zinc’s demand the strength of futures and spot prices are closely correlated to gdp growth while early in  there were many concerns relative to potential weakness in chinese gdp growth weakness certainly did not materialize with gdp at nearly  for the march  quarter the fastest pace for the chinese economy in more than two years for the full year  there was a significant demand versus supply deficit with several analysts indicating that nearly  metric tons of zinc was consumed in excess of what was mined as is shown on exhibit five as is explained above this was primarily attributable to the closure of several major mining operations the price for the rest of  of course is anyone’s guess there appears to be some credence to the theory that the strong rally in zinc prices that was related to the supplydemand imbalance may be coming to an end several mining operations that had been shut down due to low prices in  are currently the process of restarting as prices moved well above the recent historic averages while this increased supply may temper future price rallies it is generally thought these expanded operations will not be able to bring significant supplies to the market for at least several more years therefore while the sharp price increases in zinc may be over for now prices are still at very attractive levels on a historic basis exhibit five – zinc production lags usage during  source alcline metals forecasting llc kootenay’s opportunity as discussed above zinc prices remain high relative to historic levels as a result of continued strong demand at a time when supplies are being constrained the demand versus supply imbalance is creating significant opportunities for mining operators that either increase production levels of current operations or bring new resources to the marketplace while it is certainly clear that mine operators who had curtailed operations during the price slumps of  are in the process of bringing back online some of the shuttered capacity there are other companies that are seeking to develop entirely new sources of zinc kootenay zinc inc is one such company kootenay is an exploration stage company based in vancouver british columbia canada that has its eyes on developing what could be one of the largest zinc mining opportunities seen in a long time mineral and metal prospectors look for specific geological formations in order to predict the best locations to explore for example one positive sign that gold exists within a geographic formation is the presence of quartz therefore prospectors and geologists search for quartz reef formations as a sign the area may present opportunities for gold mining there are also specific geographic formations that point to significant deposits of zinc sedimentary exhaustive deposits called sedex deposits are by far the most important geographic formations pointing to significant deposits of zinc and lead and to a lesser extent silver gold copper and tungsten the geology of sedex formations is significantly outside the scope of this report simply put such formations and deposits form due to a very specific set of geological events occurring over long periods of time the earth is divided into many different tectonic plates which are constantly shifting the source of growth for these tectonic plates occurs deep within the oceans along midoceanic ridges which are somewhat like underwater mountain ranges as material moves up from the lower layers of the earth through these midocean ridges the materials are mixed with ocean water these materials which include metals such as zinc when combined with sea water undergo various changes and eventually settle into sedimentary formations which geologists have named sedimentary exhalative deposits or sedex any discussion of zinc prospecting and mining needs to take into consideration sedex formations as such deposits are responsible for more than half of the world’s zinc and lead deposits to summarize if you want to find zinc or lead within the earth’s crust a sedex deposit is a great place to start there are of course two options here – the first is to find a new sedex deposit the second is to search for zinc or lead within proximity to an existing sedex deposit kootenay is doing the latter while geologists have found more than  significant sedex deposits worldwide the three largest are located in australia the united states and canada some of these are noted in exhibit six notice the sullivan formation is noted as one of the world’s largest where kootenay zinc is exploring  miles away exhibit six – largest sedex formations on earth include the sullivan formation source mining today newsletter llc mt isa in australia is easily the largest accumulation of zinc lead and silver in the world the general area has five gigantic sedex deposits which have been mined for billions of dollars of these commodities arguably the secondlargest deposit is called red dog which is located in alaska that site alone produces approximately  of all worldwide zinc also of significant size and particularly germane to the kootenay zinc story is the sullivan deposit which is located in british columbia canada prospectors discovered the deposit in  and it was quickly put into service sullivan has produced over  million tons of zinc lead and a significant amount of silver it is estimated the value of the zinc lead and silver mined at sullivan is worth more than  billion the zinc lead and silver that was deposited at sullivan was the result of a unique sedex deposit that formed hundreds of millions of years ago in the aldridge and selwyn ancient sea basins after more than  years of active production the sullivan mine was closed in  in close proximity to fort steele british columbia canada and approximately  miles  km to the east of the sullivan mine is the sully project which is being developed by kootenay zinc while there are relatively good odds that the sedex deposit extends from the site of the former sullivan mine for  miles to the company’s sully project significant drill work and research needs to be completed to prove out the geological theory in fact there are many geological similarities between sully and sullivan for example several of the geographic formations are of the same type at both locations and research indicates that the formations at sully were formed at the exact time hundreds of millions of years ago as when the formations were formed at sullivan these facts do not prove significant zinclead deposits as additional work must be performed in order to provide more conclusive evidence while the intricacies of gravitational and other geological testing techniques are outside the scope of this report there have been various such tests performed at sully that compare very favorably to the exact measurement results performed on the sullivan site these tests involve complex analysis of gravitational and magnetic abnormalities at both locations the results of which lead geologists and the management team of kootenay to believe the sedex deposit may extend all the way to the sully site indicating at the very least two large undetermined anomalies present on the property but of course the data described above while quite sophisticated only indicate the likelihood or the possibility of a significant deposit of zinc and lead in order to prove the existence the company must continue its drilling program at the site to pull up core samples which are then tested for the existence of mineralization at the beginning of january  the company updated investors on the latest gravitational model for the sully project based on this updated model and information obtained from test drilling during november of  the company announced that the drilling program would be expanded in midmarch of this year the company announced it had completed drill hole sy but the test “…did not intersect an extensive high density mass but did intersect a number of geologically significant features with similarities to the sullivan sedimentary environment” this means they did not find evidence of a significant deposit but what they did pull up further indicated that the geological features of the sully site are in fact very similar to those of the very lucrative sullivan mine site basically not great news because they did not find exactly what they were looking for – but nevertheless it offers hope that they are near the right location the company at the end of march announced it had reviewed additional gravitational data relating to the sully site that further validates their belief in the potential for a significant deposit at sully management indicates this information will be used to further refine the drilling strategy the company also indicated that the drilling program would resume in late april of  as of early may  publication date of this report management and the company’s investors are now eagerly awaiting commencement of drilling at the sy site in order to prove that the gravity related tests performed earlier are in fact assisting the geological team to zero in on the anomalies present the kootenay team we are intrigued by the team kootenay zinc has put together to manage the development of the sully project it is almost an understatement to indicate that the team is highly experienced having worked at some of the world’s most significant mining operations additionally on board is a technical team that has very strong expertise including specific experience at sullivan some of these players include stuart tookie angus mr angus is one of the most experienced business advisors to the mining industry he is the former chairman of the board of bc sugar refinery ltd and he was a director of first quantum minerals until june  he was also a director of canico resources corp until its takeover by cvrd in  and a director of bema gold until its takeover by kinross gold in  more recently he was managing director of mergers and acquisitions for endeavour financial a director of ventana gold until its takeover by aux canada acquisition in  and a director of plutonic power until its merger with magma energy in  he is presently chairman of nevsun resources ltd which operates one of the highestgrade openpit copper mines in the world he is also the current chairman of k mining inc jonathan rubinstein jonathan rubinstein is the chairman of mag silver corporation and is vice president of andagan resources corporation we believe it’s significant that he was also one of the founders of canico resources corporation where he acquired and developed the onca puma nickel deposit in brazil he brings significant management and corporate finance experience to the team peter meredith the company has also managed to add peter meredith to its advisory board meredith has been a director of ivanhoe mines ltd formerly ivan plats limited since may  mr meredith is the former deputy chairman and chief financial officer of ivanhoe mines ltd now turquoise hill resources ltd where he was involved in overseeing ivanhoe mines ltd’s business development and corporate relations mr meredith was member of the board of directors of ivanhoe mines ltd and also served as its chief financial officer from may  to may  and from june  to november  and as its deputy chairman from may  to april  mr meredith was also chairman of southgobi resources ltd until september  paul ransom pgeo sully project manager we believe a significant addition to the technical team is paul ransom due to his specific experience and knowledge of the sullivan deposit mr ransom is a geologist and noted sullivan sedex deposit expert having worked for over  years with cominco now teck resources limited at the sullivan mine and on related regional geology mr ransom has authored andor coauthored ten papers on geology of the sullivan deposit mr ransom also spent  years as a project geologist under secondment to mt isa mines in australia another largescale copper lead zinc and silver mine mr ransom has worked extensively in the kootenay region of bc including managing drilling at sullivan deeps but has also worked in the yukon and northwest territories mr ransom’s passion for finding other megasedex deposits has been a careerlong pursuit dr david broughton phd geo senior technical advisor dr david broughton joined ivanhoe mines in january  and has overseen ivanhoe mines’ discovery of two major mineral deposits kamoa in the drc and the flatreef in south africa dr broughton is recognized as an expert in sedimenthosted copper deposits and has been a key participant in several discoveries and successful development projects drc namibia china united states canada and poland he was coleader of the kamoa discovery team that is the  recipient of the prospectors  developers association of canada’s pdac prestigious thayer lindsley award this award honouring the memory of one of canada’s greatest mine finders recognizes an individual or a team of explorationists credited with a recent significant mineral discovery conclusions investment in kootenay is certainly not without significant risk but we are intrigued by the opportunity over the past two years zinc has clearly been the allstar base metal while prices have come back somewhat over the past few months we are still near alltime historic highs the chinese and indian economies remain very strong and both remain strong consumers of zinc while the nearrecord prices seen during  encouraged several operators to bring back idled capacity it is not clear at this time how much of the demandsupply imbalance these players will be able to address overall it appears that the market for zinc will remain robust for at least the next few years while some may characterize recent announcements of less than perfect drilling results as significant negatives such results are common for junior miners and should be taken in stride based on the overall set of company dynamics the close proximity to sullivan the intriguing gravitational data and the limited encouraging information from the drilling all continue to point to strong potential at sully while of course the significance of the overall strength of the kootenay team will have no bearing on whether or not there is zinc and lead in the ground we can nevertheless not avoid being enthusiastic by having such a worldclass entrepreneurialoriented mining team on board for this journey with the price of the common shares down on what was perceived as negative drilling results but with otherwise strong data that could follow we see an opportunity for riskadverse investors to consider purchasing the shares certainly this is a speculative story worth monitoring moving
