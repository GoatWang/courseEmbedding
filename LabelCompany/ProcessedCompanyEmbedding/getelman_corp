this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business because our auditors have raised a going concern there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available     page our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the plan of operation section of this prospectus as of january   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from mark gitelman our sole officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr gitelman has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing   if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business we are company with limited operations have incurred expenses and have losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on july   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail   page we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the marketing of business consulting and event planning company and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of business consulting and event planning services is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful business consulting and event planning companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our sole officer and director will own more than  of our outstanding common stock he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders   page mr gitelman our sole officer and director will own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr gitelman may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company currently we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director we depend entirely on mark gitelman for all of our operations the loss of mr gitelman would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail mr gitelman has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of mr gitelmans services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations mark gitelman our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations he will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company mark gitelman our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors   page we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile risks associated with this offering because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on july   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   page this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan the regulation of penny stocks by the sec and finra may discourage the tradability of the companys securities   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all our president mr gitelman does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities  and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr gitelman does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between getelman corp and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   the estimated cost of this registration statement is  which will be paid from offering proceeds if the offering proceeds are less than registration cost we will have to utilize funds from mark gitelman our sole officer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process mr gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an sec reporting obligation we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board the companys investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of shares for various considerations in the future our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are currently issued and outstanding if we sell the  shares being offered in this offering we would have  shares issued and outstanding as discussed in the dilution section below the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of

section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised

month period described in our plan of operation below to maintain a reporting status our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this

enterprises have their own established event planning teams we intend to commence operations in the business consulting with specialization in teambuilding activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between coworkers  we plan to make create our event beneficial for the companies because a the employes will get a unique experience of togetherness and friendly environment inside the staff as a possible outcome b properly planned and carried out event may help a company to get a positive image before employees to enhance their loyalty to their company in order to help our customers achieve the mentioned above results we plan to provide customers with the highest level of event planning and hosting our principal office address is located at  e flamingo rd suite  las vegas nv  our telephone number is  our plan of operation is forwardlooking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations we are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue it is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding business our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market we plan to target medium and small companies which we refer to as clients or customers as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams our company plans to concentrate on teambuilding corporate events offering various sorts of scripts for outdoor corporate retreats as well as for indoor corporate parties we anticipate that adventurous services we offer to unite coworkers and to build a strong team will attract customers we intend to offer a great variety of activities acceptable for most ages and suitable for people of average physical conditions such as rpgs roleplay games treasure hunt games outdoor quests sport competitions or any other sorts of outdoor activities as well as quizzes indoor quests known as quests of a closed room and many other different indoor activities taking into consideration our clients requirements our company may provide event scripts which may combine several activities in a single event depending on the customers demand corporate parties with music performers to follow the corporate retreat can be offered  in addition to the planning of the events our company plans to offer hosting events as well for which we intend employ entertainers mcs or hosts of our own which also means organizing those parties and decorating are the duties of our company we believe that its cost effective for small and mediumsized business to work with our company because once they have their event properly planned they wont be troubled to search another third party to carry the plan out within the process of the business development we may think of additional services such as lodging accommodation at our premises catering transferring by transport to the location of the event if the client company wishes so we also intend to provide filming or photographic shooting of the events we conduct to be distributed on dvds among employees of the client company and to be used later for advertizing purposes as well we plan to post the edited video snippets and photos to our website which we anticipate to be one of the key elements in attracting customers interest and advertising our services providing feature of having an account on our website belonging to a company we intend to grant our loyal customers with discounts and special offers and to distribute advertising prospects along with the update information regarding our services   page clients our company is providing services to corporate customers only the corporate customer is a company that contracts with our company to plan and typically host an event for the company we anticipate that small and mediumsized corporations will be turning to our company to plan the events marketing and advertising we plan to apply the following marketing instruments to attract customers attention online advertisements  clickable banners static or animated placed on the websites related to business corporate culture event planning and recreational services we anticipate that it will also help us to align with the similar companies that do not provide event hosting services and may delegate this function to us search engine optimisation in order to attract attention to our website we seek for the opportunity of seo search engine optimisation to occupy the top places in search results of google bing yandex and similar search engines we also look forward to buying advertising space on the pages of the mentioned engines we choose the internet as the main instrument because it is seen as the largest repository of data and people tend to search any information online to get a great variety of options to choose from rather than use other available sources video advertisement and commercials  we see the benefit of video advertisements for our company awareness in their versatility by which we mean possibility to use them on the internet youtube vimeo and other similar video hosting sites as well as the other sites we intend to use for advertising on tv in a form of video commercials on video billboards and other installments with video playback function radio commercials and printed advertisement we plan to support online advertising campaign with commercials on the most popular radio stations and in the printed media to enhance our companys  awareness we suppose that this step may help us to remain in the focus of attention of those who already encountered our online or video advertisements as well as get the attention of those who tend to rely on printed media or doesnt have an opportunity to search the internet to achieve the largest scope of potential clients we also look forward at advertising through companies selling recreational and entertaining tours even the ones who work with individuals as an individual might happen to be a senior a person responsible for human resources or a person who propose the corporate event to the seniors of their company competition we plan to take our own niche in the market of corporate events as we plan to work in a highly competitive market many entertaining companies with similar services make it such we believe that we are about to compete favorably on the basis that there are companies that offer only entertaining activities companies specializing on rewarding or celebration parties or companies offering training events or product launch events whereas our goal is to offer events which we presume will result in stronger unity of coworkers after they experience hardship of the adventures we plan to offer our companys competitive edge is about to be based on two factors specialization and strategic relationships our company will be specializing in two distinct areas of corporate planning while specializing essentially precludes our company out of a lot of different markets it allows our company to excel in the markets that it has chosen to participate in specialization allows our company to be an expert in the two areas that it is in additionally the expert knowledge allows our company to provide the service as a cost saving to the company because the fewer services our company offers the more they can concentrate on improving the current offerings improvements that our company strive for is a reduction in cost charged to the client and an improvement to the level of services offered   page our companys second competitive edge is based on the use of strategic relationships our company clearly realizes that they cannot be good at everything our company believes it is better to concentrate on a few things excel in those areas and form strategic partnerships with companies that excel in the service areas that our company doesnt applying this philosophy our company has decided in addition to planning corporate retreat training sessions they want to offer the service of hostingleading these events as well the service of hostingleading however is quite different than planning and our company believes that it would be more cost effective to form a strategic relationship with an expert in this field instead of trying to become proficient themselves our company then is able to offer a topnotch service offering of hostingleading the training seminars but does not have to invest heavily in developing the program the use of strategic relationships is unusual in the event planning space most event planners are generalists and try to do a little of everything our company is following the model of benchmark companies in other industries that have recognized the value of specialization and the use of strategic relationships revenue our revenues primarily derive from planning corporate events thus working out the entire script and from hosting the events which possibly might be planned by another company that doesnt specialize in hosting so the basic charge includes writing a script or updating it for the needs of the customer adding to it the price of hosting an event video and photoshoot editing the videos mounting the dvds with the videos and photos of the event fees are calculated on the fixed charge for a script and hourly base of hosting the event if a client company orders music performers to appear at any stage of the event it will also make an added value to the total cost of the event in case the company will be successful to obtain premises of its own lodging and catering are about to be charged as well depending on customers demand if turns cost effective we will try to look forward to offering our clients commemorative merchandise such as photo magnets cups with photos tshirts office supplies with photos or marks related to the event they participated in we plan that our service will cost for the potential clients from  to  of total budget of the event   insurance we do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future because we do not have any insurance if we are made a party of

to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules consequently these penny stock rules may affect the ability of brokerdealers to

investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business because our auditors have raised a going concern there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment   page we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available   our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the plan of operation section of this prospectus as of january   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from mark gitelman our sole officer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr gitelman has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing   if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business we are company with limited operations have incurred expenses and have losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition   page we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on july   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the marketing of business consulting and event planning company and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of business consulting and event planning services is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful business consulting and event planning companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected   page some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our sole officer and director will own more than  of our outstanding common stock he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders mr gitelman our sole officer and director will own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr gitelman may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   page we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company currently we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director we depend entirely on mark gitelman for all of our operations the loss of mr gitelman would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail mr gitelman has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of mr gitelmans services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations mark gitelman our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations he will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company mark gitelman our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected   page we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   page risks associated with this offering because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on july   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan the regulation of penny stocks by the sec and finra may discourage the tradability of the companys securities   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all   page our president mr gitelman does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities  and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr gitelman does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between getelman corp and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment   page we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   the estimated cost of this registration statement is  which will be paid from offering proceeds if the offering proceeds are less than registration cost we will have to utilize funds from mark gitelman our sole officer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process mr gitelmans verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an sec reporting obligation we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board the companys investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of shares for various considerations in the future our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are currently issued and outstanding if we sell the  shares being offered in this offering we would have  shares issued and outstanding as discussed in the dilution section below the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and

repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation determination of offering price   the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the

offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities   page dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering

minimum of  of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our plan of operation below to maintain a reporting status our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our

month plan of operations description of business   our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market we plan to target medium and small companies which we refer to as clients or customers as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams we intend to commence operations in the business consulting with specialization in teambuilding activities and events in order to establish strong sense of unity between coworkers  we plan to make create our event beneficial for the companies because a the employes will get a unique experience of togetherness and friendly environment inside the staff as a possible outcome b properly planned and carried out event may help a company to get a positive image before employees to enhance their loyalty to their company in order to help our customers achieve the mentioned above results we plan to provide customers with the highest level of event planning and hosting our principal office address is located at  e flamingo rd suite  las vegas nv  our telephone number is  our plan of operation is forwardlooking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations we are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue it is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding   page business our company prepares to offer event planning for the corporate market we plan to target medium and small companies which we refer to as clients or customers as in most cases big enterprises have their own established event planning teams our company plans to concentrate on teambuilding corporate events offering various sorts of scripts for outdoor corporate retreats as well as for indoor corporate parties we anticipate that adventurous services we offer to unite coworkers and to build a strong team will attract customers we intend to offer a great variety of activities acceptable for most ages and suitable for people of average physical conditions such as rpgs roleplay games treasure hunt games outdoor quests sport competitions or any other sorts of outdoor activities as well as quizzes indoor quests known as quests of a closed room and many other different indoor activities taking into consideration our clients requirements our company may provide event scripts which may combine several activities in a single event depending on the customers demand corporate parties with music performers to follow the corporate retreat can be offered  in addition to the planning of the events our company plans to offer hosting events as well for which we intend employ entertainers mcs or hosts of our own which also means organizing those parties and decorating are the duties of our company we believe that its cost effective for small and mediumsized business to work with our company because once they have their event properly planned they wont be troubled to search another third party to carry the plan out within the process of the business development we may think of additional services such as lodging accommodation at our premises catering transferring by transport to the location of the event if the client company wishes so we also intend to provide filming or photographic shooting of the events we conduct to be distributed on dvds among employees of the client company and to be used later for advertizing purposes as well we plan to post the edited video snippets and photos to our website which we anticipate to be one of the key elements in attracting customers interest and advertising our services providing feature of having an account on our website belonging to a company we intend to grant our loyal customers with discounts and special offers and to distribute advertising prospects along with the update information regarding our services clients our company is providing services to corporate customers only the corporate customer is a company that contracts with our company to plan and typically host an event for the company we anticipate that small and mediumsized corporations will be turning to our company to plan the events marketing and advertising we plan to apply the following marketing instruments to attract customers attention online advertisements  clickable banners static or animated placed on the websites related to business corporate culture event planning and recreational services we anticipate that it will also help us to align with the similar companies that do not provide event hosting services and may delegate this function to us   page search engine optimisation in order to attract attention to our website we seek for the opportunity of seo search engine optimisation to occupy the top places in search results of google bing yandex and similar search engines we also look forward to buying advertising space on the pages of the mentioned engines we choose the internet as the main instrument because it is seen as the largest repository of data and people tend to search any information online to get a great variety of options to choose from rather than use other available sources video advertisement and commercials  we see the benefit of video advertisements for our company awareness in their versatility by which we mean possibility to use them on the internet youtube vimeo and other similar video hosting sites as well as the other sites we intend to use for advertising on tv in a form of video commercials on video billboards and other installments with video playback function radio commercials and printed advertisement we plan to support online advertising campaign with commercials on the most popular radio stations and in the printed media to enhance our companys  awareness we suppose that this step may help us to remain in the focus of attention of those who already encountered our online or video advertisements as well as get the attention of those who tend to rely on printed media or doesnt have an opportunity to search the internet to achieve the largest scope of potential clients we also look forward at advertising through companies selling recreational and entertaining tours even the ones who work with individuals as an individual might happen to be a senior a person responsible for human resources or a person who propose the corporate event to the seniors of their company competition we plan to take our own niche in the market of corporate events as we plan to work in a highly competitive market many entertaining companies with similar services make it such we believe that we are about to compete favorably on the basis that there are companies that offer only entertaining activities companies specializing on rewarding or celebration parties or companies offering training events or product launch events whereas our goal is to offer events which we presume will result in stronger unity of coworkers after they experience hardship of the adventures we plan to offer our companys competitive edge is about to be based on two factors specialization and strategic relationships our company will be specializing in two distinct areas of corporate planning while specializing essentially precludes our company out of a lot of different markets it allows our company to excel in the markets that it has chosen to participate in specialization allows our company to be an expert in the two areas that it is in additionally the expert knowledge allows our company to provide the service as a cost saving to the company because the fewer services our company offers the more they can concentrate on improving the current offerings improvements that our company strive for is a reduction in cost charged to the client and an improvement to the level of services offered   page our companys second competitive edge is based on the use of strategic relationships our company clearly realizes that they cannot be good at everything our company believes it is better to concentrate on a few things excel in those areas and form strategic partnerships with companies that excel in the service areas that our company doesnt applying this philosophy our company has decided in addition to planning corporate retreat training sessions they want to offer the service of hostingleading these events as well the service of hostingleading however is quite different than planning and our company believes that it would be more cost effective to form a strategic relationship with an expert in this field instead of trying to become proficient themselves our company then is able to offer a topnotch service offering of hostingleading the training seminars but does not have to invest heavily in developing the program the use of strategic relationships is unusual in the event planning space most event planners are generalists and try to do a little of everything our company is following the model of benchmark companies in other industries that have recognized the value of specialization and the use of strategic relationships revenue our revenues primarily derive from planning corporate events thus working out the entire script and from hosting the events which possibly might be planned by another company that doesnt specialize in hosting so the basic charge includes writing a script or updating it for the needs of the customer adding to it the price of hosting an event video and photoshoot editing the videos mounting the dvds with the videos and photos of the event fees are calculated on the fixed charge for a script and hourly base of hosting the event if a client company orders music performers to appear at any stage of the event it will also make an added value to the total cost of the event in case the company will be successful to obtain premises of its own lodging and catering are about to be charged as well depending on customers demand if turns cost effective we will try to look forward to offering our clients commemorative merchandise such as photo magnets cups with photos tshirts office supplies with photos or marks related to the event they participated in we plan that our service will cost for the potential clients from  to  of total budget of the event   insurance we do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future because we do not have any insurance if we are made a party of a products liability action we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation if that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations   page employees identification of certain significant employees we are a development stage company and currently have no employees mark gitelman our sole officer and

note that our stock is a penny stock the sec has adopted rule g which generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price as defined less than  per share or an exercise price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions our securities are covered by the penny stock rules which impose additional sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to
