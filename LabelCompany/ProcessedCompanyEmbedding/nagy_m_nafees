who took my vitals  a european lady whose name i forget  was fantastic on both visits she was professional knowledgeable friendly and had a great manner unfortunately the md i was there to see dr debelen did not even come close to matching the level of service that his staff provided indeed he offered a shockingly low level of service here is a summary of my two visits i was referred to dr debelen by a local hospital having undergone a nonsurgical procedure there at the hospital the resulting wound had of course been thoroughly dressed obviously in order for dr debelen to examine the wound i had to remove the dressing i duly did so and he examined the wound he advised me to return in a week if there was no improvement he then concluded the presentation  while the dressing was half attached and still needing fixing he left the room i wondered if i had made a mistake and that he was going to return in order to apply a new dressing or at least fix the one i had ripped off i waited and waited sure enough it really was over so i had to go and look for him in the corridors to ask him to help me with the dressing i had not brought any medical supplies with me and the adhesive no longer stuck he asked a nurse to give me some tape this gave the impression of a doctor who doesnt care much for his patients something i am not used to dr debelen did not strike me as being very knowledgeable during my first visit and my expectations were low for visit no but he somehow managed to fall below what i would term a basic level of care before the hospital visit mentioned above i had been prescribed antibiotics which had caused an allergic reaction the hospital had then prescribed penicillin but it hadnt had the desired effect  the wound was not healing sufficiently i sat on a regular chair in dr debelens office  instead of going and getting another chair and sitting down next to me dr debelen sprawled out across the patient bed with his laptop in the same manner my cousin would if he was watching youtube videos he then decided to prescribe me the same drug that had caused me the allergic reaction in the first place i was astonished and told him no thats what i was allergic to not only did he not appear to be helping but if i had not been totally switched on he may well has caused me some more problems overall this is the worst medical professional i have encountered and i certainly will not returnezeanolue david d mdrick g rateddear dr dolue ezeanolue dr ez and kind staffmy account has been turned over to collections last week because i was billed and rightly so for injections that took place after my insurance had run out i was not told this now i owe the office upwards of  which i am willing to work on with monthly payments however the woman i dealt with in your collections was not the most accommodating person i tried to work with her but all i can afford is  a month im on a strict budget i am hiv and on very expensive lifesaving medications and all the costs that that entails and i also see other doctors for that medical condition as well as have expensive blood work  times a year so now i have to find a new pain doctor all because she collection agent refused to work with me this pains me because i thoroughly enjoyed coming into your office and seeing people who i now consider my friends because they are so caring i find it so hard and sad to think that i wont be coming back under my health plan of nevada because of the actions of one woman i will miss seeing the nice professional people in the office who took such great care of menot only my pain but always asked about my hiv status and genuinely cared its very very sad to me to have to locate another pain office as dr ez and his staff were always so kind and helpful in the future i will definitely recommend apex but not after recounting this horrible experience with one collection agent in your office so sadly and with a heavy heart i say goodbye to apex and my wonderful family of medical professionals theresincerelyrick grayson  dob michael e seiff mddaniel h ratedif you are just browsing i will get right to the bottom line dr seiff is a fantastic doctor and neurosurgeon i give him my highest possible recommendation if you already know you need to see a neurosurgeon go straight to dr seiff six months ago dr seiff performed a double laminectomy and more on my lower spine l through l and below prior to the surgery i was having near debilitating nerve pain in both legs bad enough that simply standing up was painful today i am pain free i found everything about dr seiff to be topnotch and firstclass including his wonderful staff and assistants who constantly communicated with and calmed a very nervous patient me the doctor was extremely careful and detailed in explaining everything before and after the surgery allowing me to understand totally what was going on i want to stress that if you are having pain in your head neck back arms or legs you need to see a neurosurgeon first if you have already received a diagnosis from a different kind of practitioner especially if it entails surgery you need to get a second opinion from a neurosurgeon in my case another surgeon had already scheduled me for both an anterior and posterior fusion when i hit the pause button and went to see dr seiff it may be the smartest decision i ever made neurosurgeons are medical doctors with extremely rigorous advanced training dr michael seiff is wellqualified welltrained and very experienced but in the end it is his skill in the operating room that makes him special in my case that skill has given me a new life and i thank him every day for his superior workpedsduane o ratedit is a shame that dr dewan who is a great pediatric endocrinologist hires such an unprofessional office staff i would give him  stars but unfortunately i have to deal more with the front office staff than dr dewan never returning your calls in a timely manner interrupting you while you are explaining what is needed and claiming they never received faxed prescriptions from a pharmacy they always do business with all means that customer service is not a priority i am sure they have many tasks to perform and probably deal with many people who are difficult but at this point i would probably get better service at the va unfortunately i can not tell this directly to dr dewan unless i have an appointment or send him a certified letter in the mail dr dewan is great with my son and i highly recommend him however i wish he would put more effort into selecting quality staff who believe in customer service and doing what is right it may not be fair to give him a low rating because of his staff but ultimately he is responsible for the hiring of said individuals i promise if the experiences improve i will revise my reviewtimothy duanne francis drelaine d ratedi have suffered with sciatica pain for over  years i love to take long walks but after  minutes or so i would be hobbling back home in serious pain i would have to lie down with my right leg elevated for  minutes until the pain subsided even after that i would be limping around the house for the rest of the day then i was referred to dr francis after only  visits i am now taking long brisk walks for  minutes with no pain when i get home i dont have to sit or lie down at all i am able to continue functioning normally for the rest of the day with no discomfort i cant believe it i feel like i have a new lease on life i highly recommend dr francis and have complete confidence in his ability to help me correct other medical issues that i have as well thank you dr francisjonathan bernstein mdcadatownley rateddr berstein is a very devoted and caring man even though he is a childrens oncologist he is one of the only hemotologists in the area that has a full understanding of factor  lieden deficiency and factor  proficiency it is a rare bleeding disorder and often when i appear at the er and find a doctor that needs to be quickly educated on it so i dont die from blood lose or from receiving the wrong type of blood products well they get offended and ask me when i went to

they talk very loud on the front office and they just all around dont seem welcoming or happy to see a patient walk in the dooronly woman that made my office experience close to what it should be was an older woman with red hair very nice and very humorous doctor if you see this you need an office meeting on hospitality asapnowins john m mdjessica s ratedi am very pleased with the care i receive

the insurance plan you have you may have insurance through employment your spouse your parents if youre under  or the marketplace if the previous options dont apply to you its important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what youll need to pay foryour insurance will have a deductible which is the amount that youre responsible to pay for covered medical expenses some plans have coinsurances where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill and insurance will cover the rest copays state a flat rate for certain services like paying  when you visit your gp or a  copay for an emergency room visit once you reach your outofpocket maximum which will differ if youre an individual or within a family plan your insurance may pay for  percent of covered medical

can choose the best doctor for your needs understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expensessetting your appointmentmost doctors require a phone call for an appointment although some may provide online scheduling as well be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment and to bring it with you to the actual appointment they need the id numbers to verify your coverage and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you dont have to show it again unless your insurance changeswhen you call let them know if youre a new patient as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit tell them the reason for your visit such as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect your appointment may progress faster as a result and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early
