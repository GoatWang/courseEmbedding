months and not much of the original content appeals nor do old british shows so i dumped it for hulu and i’m so glad i did more relevant options shows you want to binge watch reply rs says april   at  am netflix really isn’t impressive — at all — the moment you step off american soil and into any other market they serve can’t deny what they’ve achieved but in every other country but the us the local competition all but ensures netflix isn’t the only option reply christina says april   at  pm if they were responsible for the horrible new rating system – “see ya – wouldn’t wanna be ya” if not sorry to see them go maybe they will start a great competitor with a rating system that isn’t dummied down to the lowest base and useless for users reply j says april   at  pm both wonderful people whom i hope are leaving of their own accord onto greener pastures especially a shame re tawni the only female and minority representative on the clevel at netflix… reply craven moorehead says april   at  am who cares that she is female an a minority she was incompetent at her job netflix wants top talent in every role i’ve been in a lot of meetings where she just hand waved and used buzz words as she road the coattails of patty mccord who really did invent the netflix culture you hear so much about once she explained that she was rethinking a lot of “sacred cows” like remote working someone asked “what other sacred cows are you rethinking” and she was totally stumped i think that i have seen her dance more times than i have heard her speak reply see all  comments more digital news from
