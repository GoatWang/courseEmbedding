get it dealing with safety compliance issues can be a nightmare with constant changes to safety standards and your own facility updates it seems like a never ending cycle and to make things worse osha can impose both civil and criminal penalties on employers who fail to abide by the legally required safety standards we know that it is very important to you and your company to avoid mistakes which can result in costly fines injuries or death so yes it’s critical for you to establish safety guidelines for your employees and visitors but effective communication of these policies is key when fostering a culture of safety we know that it’s a trying task to coordinate safety training for everyone and you have to stop pretending that your receptionist can educate all employees and visitors who enter your facility about the safety rules for the shop floor or in case of an emergency so look  we’ve solved safety communication issues for facilities just like yours and we know the facilities that hold safety records get that general and generic safety communication tools just don’t work when they don’t cater to your specific facility discover our proven  step system that helps manufacturing facilities stay compliant and systemize custom safety communications fast and effectively gain a peace of mind and keep everyone in your facility safe by contacting us today think of that moment you get when seeing something in a video that helps you understand what pictures and words simply cannot convey  more and more video is becoming the new document in corporate communications video can be an excellent tool for corporate messaging and i want to talk about whywhy is video such an effective tool when it comes to corporate messaging here are three key areas the combination of seeing and hearing – this might sound obvious but combining visual and audio interaction has a much greater impact  studies show that retention rates of information that is both seen and heard is  compared with  retention for hearing and  retention for seeing introducing an emotional element – one key aspect of most company meetings is about safety performance while everyone wants the company to comply to safety standards the details of safety plans and procedures are not always engaging sending out an email or doing a conference call about safety is one thing but adding a face to those words and having employees see the excitement or disappointment creates an experience where the employee is more likely to feel a sense of ownership and responsibility this is all together what you want to accomplish an engaged employee with a strong moraleeasily update video with new information  since there are always updates to safety and facility procedures it is very important to use a tool that can be easily and inexpensively updated with video you can easily have the outdated footage replaced with the new procedures without going into a brand new production the ability to reach your audience – a video communication message can be sent anywhere in the world to any device easily and quickly this allows large diversely located companies to send effective communications to their employees in a scalable costeffective way create custom content for safety communicationsvague generic safety and health programs will not meet the jobspecific requirements of many safety codes youve ordered the generic safety videos before probably in the s today those outdated safety films leave so much out you play the video and then you spend an hour explaining the things that are different in your facility and equipment streamline your safety communications and make it right the first time your employes will be engaged and entertained when they see your actual location and we can even feature some of your current staff in your custom safety video contact us nowcustom video inquiry name  first last company  position  email  phone number  project timing  less than  month
