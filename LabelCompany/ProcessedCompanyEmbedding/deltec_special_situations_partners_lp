the investment objective of the partnership is to achieve investment returns that are consistently superior to the yields of shortterm fixedincome instruments the partnership will seek to achieve its objective by focusing primarily on eventdriven opportunities in the equity markets because its investment program is eventdriven the investment manager believes that the partnerships investment results will not have a high degree of correlation to the broader equity market despite the fact that the partnerships investments will consist primarily of equity and equityequivalent securities while the investment manager intends to seek situations for which an event has been announced the partnership may also invest in the securities of companies for which the investment manager believes an event may develop in the near to intermediate term in pursuit of its investment objective the partnership may purchase and sell options engage in short selling and employ leverage there can be no assurance that the partnership will achieve its investment objective deltec special situations partners lp  pooled investment fund coolidge formdscom  sec filings of fundraisings and investments in
