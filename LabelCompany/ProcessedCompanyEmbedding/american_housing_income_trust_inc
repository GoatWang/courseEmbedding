largest producer of cbd in the us ixb is implementing its business plan to be the largest producer of cbd in the united states  cbd is the part of the cannabis plant that typically is used for health reasons instead of for recreational purposes cbd products are either derived from industrial hemp plants or marijuana plants  ixb was developed as a joint venture combining several strategic partners including the shoshone battle mountain and washoe indian tribes as well as combing various concepts and industryspecific knowledge in commercial hemp and cannabis research and sales these relationships enable ixb access to tribal lands for farming commercial hemp and cannabis and will allow ixb to sell hemp and cannabis products in retail outlets on tribal lands wwwixbiotechcom management commentary mr ogburn stated we felt that the combination of ahit with our business model represented the best upside potential for both ixb and ahits shareholders  ahits current portfolio of real estate and desire to expand its real estate holdings and willingness to diversify its holdings and operations into other types of real estate and industries was an attractive option for ixb  our initial focus is in developing over  acres of land in cooperation with the washoe tribal allotment for the manufacturing of four greenhouses with a combined usable square footage of  and mr zarinegar and his team of property experts and management personnel seemed to be the perfect fit for ixb  cbd has become a highly sought after compound in recent years taking the natural products industry by storm after receiving highly publicized exposure in the media  ixb would not face any importing concerns and would be in a strong position for immediate growth as it develops  we believe this unique combination of real estate holdings and land development provides significant upside opportunity the companys current single family residential portfolio will be managed by the real estate committee as a subcommittee to the board of directors mr zarinegar remains as a member of the real estate committee along with kenneth hedrick and les gutierrez mr zarinegar announced that this acquisition furthers the boards initiatives in late  to diversify its holdings management and business purpose mr zarinegar stated the company has been exploring avenues for growth in new and exciting sectors leveraging our experience in identifying costeffective sections of property with michaels expertise in developing cbd technology  we believe this new relationship with ixb will allow ahit to pursue opportunities in a growing cannabidolrelated biotechnology market and take advantage of increased regulation throughout the united states we believe this collaborative direction represents a tremendous opportunity for ahit and its shareholders we are looking forward to mr ogburns leadership vision and experience in developing strategies intended to increase shareholder value the real estate committee will continue to look at ways to diversify its members in order to bring more experience and different leadership styles in order to penetrate this demanding sector in  please email
