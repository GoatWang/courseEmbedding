the solemn responsibility of flying to france to help identify and bring home the bodies of  of atlantas art and business leaders who on an art appreciation tour died in the air france flight  plane crash at orly airport in paris many of the deceased had been personal friends of allen in his book allen wrote about going to paris immediately after the crash i realized how insignificant i was but i knew i had to assume the posture of representing these families and indeed the entire city of atlanta georgia i knew nothing about protocol foreign relations aviation international agreements or any of the other details i might become involved in i was nothing but the mayor of atlanta and a friend and neighbor of  people who had been killed at this same airport only the day beforethese were my lifelong friends this was my generation this was also the backbone of atlantas cultural society the citys leading patrons of the arts there was no precedent for this kind of agony in  allen made a very private commitment to himself and to his wife louise that he would not seek a third term in office this was not revealed to the public until january  when allen formally announced his decision at a meeting of the atlanta rotary club that year he refused to publicly endorse any particular candidate in the mayoral race until just days before the runoff between sam massell and rodney cook when reports surfaced suggesting that allens vicemayor and mayoralelect massell had abused his power as vicemayor through misuse of the atlanta police department on the sunday before the election allen called for a press conference and asked massell to immediately withdraw from consideration for an office which requires intuitive integrity and instinctive withdrawal from even the suspicion and appearance of evil despite the backlash he received allen wrote had my candidate rodney cook been involved in the same affair i am convinced i would have taken the same action – except i would have gone into greater detail to make the public fully understand the seriousness of the situation sam massell went on to win the election and succeed allen as the rd mayor of atlanta economic development of atlantaedit under mayor allens forward atlanta program the citys population grew more than  percent atlanta ranked in the top ten in the nation in downtown construction with more than  new buildings constructed and  new jobs created each year in  atlantas unemployment rate at one point plummeted to an astonishing  percent eleven of the citys twelve tallest buildings were constructed during the sixties and the atlanta international airport now hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport acquired its first direct international air routes and saw its ranking change from the tenthbusiest airport in the nation to the thirdbusiest in an attempt to manage the citys vast increase in traffic allen oversaw the early phases of construction of the interstate  perimeter and the downtown connector and presided over the creation of the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta which would take over the old atlanta transit system and build the marta rail system the  million memorial arts center now the woodruff arts center was established as a memorial to the victims of the  orly plane crash the  million atlanta civic center and the  million peachtree center complex were all built during allens mayoralty between  and  convention business in atlanta doubled with  delegates spending  million mayor allen also played a key role in bringing major league sports to atlanta in a politically risky move he backed the construction of the  million atlantafulton stadium which attracted the milwaukee braves baseball team in  the new nfl franchised falcons football team in  and the stlouis hawks basketball team arrived in   his building program with its emphasis on developing downtown was opposed by some of atlantas black leaders as not adequately meeting the need for lowincome housing despite the criticisms however there was more lowincome housing built during allens eight years as mayor than the entire thirty years prior to that allen wrote it is wonderful to be idealistic and to speak about human values but you are not going to be able to do one thing about them if you are not economically strong if there is any one slogan i lived by as mayor of atlanta that would be it civil rights and desegregationedit allens advocacy for african american rights originated from his business pragmatism he believed that to flourish atlanta must address its racial issues eventually however allen was deeply affected by daily firsthand dealings he faced with racial issues as well as the profound questions african american citizens posed to him about their humanity and the cultural system that refused to recognize them his pragmatic support of racial integration transformed rapidly into a conviction about the moral rightness of racial equality – a belief would lead allen to place himself at the center of a firestorm even before becoming mayor allen was involved in efforts to bring desegregation to atlanta for the sake of atlantas businesses and city image as president of the atlanta chamber of commerce he worked closely with judge at walden longtime africanamerican leader opie shelton vicepresident of the atlanta chamber of commerce and  owners and managers of atlantas leading department variety and chain stores to come to an agreement of the full desegregation of downtown stores and lunch counters on his first day in office he ordered all white and colored signs removed from city hall and desegregated the cafeteria this was the first of many steps he took to advance integration allen authorized black atlanta policemen to arrest whites hired the citys first black firefighters and quickly put atlanta ahead of every other city in the south as far as hiring black workers for positions other than the most menial jobs he painstakingly negotiated agreements for the accommodation of african americans at  private and public facilities including hotels swimming pools and restaurants many atlanta restaurants and other public facilities desegregated by mutual agreement between their owners and mayor allen before the passing of the civil rights act of  by january   major atlanta hotels and motels had publicly pledged to accept reservations regardless of race i wasnt so allfired liberal when i first moved into city hall allen wrote but when i saw what the racebaiters were doing or could do to hold back the orderly growth of atlanta it infuriated me and eventually swung me to the extreme end opposite them in  a riot broke out in summerhill a neighborhood south of the atlanta stadium when a white police officer shot a black resident mayor allen rushed to the scene of the riot climbing a police car in an attempt to talk to and calm the crowd he toppled from the car uninjured when the crowd repeatedly rocked

defining moment in the civil rights movement excerpts from allens testimony were published in newspapers the day after he spoke in front of congress i am firmly convinced that the supreme court

art appreciation tour died in the air france flight  plane crash at orly airport in paris many of the deceased had been personal friends of allen in his book allen wrote about going to paris immediately after the crash i realized how insignificant i was but i knew i had to assume the posture of representing these families and indeed the entire city of atlanta georgia i knew nothing about protocol foreign relations aviation international agreements or any of the other details i might become involved in i was nothing but the mayor of atlanta and a friend and neighbor of  people who had been killed at this same airport only the day beforethese were my lifelong friends this was my generation this was also the backbone of atlantas cultural society the citys leading patrons of the arts there was no precedent for this kind of agony in  allen made a very private commitment to himself and to his wife louise that he would not seek a third term in office this was not revealed to the public until january  when allen formally announced his decision at a meeting of the atlanta rotary club that year he refused to publicly endorse any particular candidate in the mayoral race until just days before the runoff between sam massell and rodney cook when reports surfaced suggesting that allens vicemayor and mayoralelect massell had abused his power as vicemayor through misuse of the atlanta police department on the sunday before the election allen called for a press conference and asked massell to immediately withdraw from consideration for an office which requires intuitive integrity and instinctive withdrawal from even the suspicion and appearance of evil despite the backlash he received allen wrote had my candidate rodney cook been involved in the same affair i am convinced i would have taken the same action – except i would have gone into greater detail to make the public fully understand the seriousness of the situation sam massell went on to win the election and succeed allen as the rd mayor of atlanta economic development of atlantaedit under mayor allens forward atlanta program the citys population grew more than  percent atlanta ranked in the top ten in the nation in downtown construction with more than  new buildings constructed and  new jobs created each year in  atlantas unemployment rate at one point plummeted to an astonishing  percent eleven of the citys twelve tallest buildings were constructed during the sixties and the atlanta international airport now hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport acquired its first direct

phases of construction of the interstate  perimeter and the downtown connector and presided over the creation of the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta which would take over the old atlanta transit system and build the marta rail system the  million memorial arts center now the woodruff arts center was established as a memorial to the victims of the  orly plane crash the  million atlanta civic center and the  million peachtree center complex were all built during allens mayoralty between  and  convention business in atlanta doubled with  delegates spending  million mayor allen also played a key role in bringing major league sports to atlanta in a politically risky move he backed the construction of the  million atlantafulton stadium which attracted the milwaukee braves baseball team in  the new nfl franchised falcons football team in  and the stlouis hawks basketball team arrived in   his building program with its emphasis on developing downtown was opposed by some of atlantas black leaders as not adequately meeting the need for lowincome housing despite the criticisms however there was more lowincome housing built during allens eight years as mayor than the entire thirty years prior to that allen wrote it is wonderful to be idealistic and to speak about human values but you are not going to be able to do one thing about them if you are not economically strong if there is any one slogan i lived by as mayor of atlanta that would be it civil rights and desegregationedit allens advocacy for african american rights originated from his business pragmatism he believed that to flourish atlanta must address its racial issues eventually however allen was deeply affected by daily firsthand dealings he faced with racial issues as well as the profound questions african american citizens posed to him about their humanity and the cultural system that refused to recognize them his pragmatic support of racial integration transformed rapidly into a conviction about the moral rightness of racial equality – a belief would lead allen to place himself at the center of a firestorm even before becoming mayor allen was involved in efforts to bring desegregation to atlanta for the sake of atlantas businesses and city image as president of the atlanta chamber of commerce he worked closely with judge at walden longtime africanamerican leader opie shelton vicepresident of the atlanta chamber of commerce and  owners and managers of atlantas leading department variety and chain stores to come to an agreement of the full desegregation of downtown stores and lunch counters on his first day in office he ordered all white and colored signs removed from city hall and desegregated the cafeteria this was the first of many steps he took to advance integration allen authorized black atlanta policemen to arrest whites hired the citys first black firefighters and quickly put atlanta ahead of every other city in the south as far as hiring black workers for positions other than the most menial jobs he painstakingly negotiated agreements for the accommodation of african americans at  private and public facilities including hotels swimming pools and restaurants many atlanta restaurants and other public facilities desegregated by mutual agreement between their owners and mayor allen before the passing of the civil rights act of  by january   major atlanta hotels and motels had publicly pledged to accept reservations regardless of race i wasnt so allfired liberal when i first moved into city hall allen wrote but when i saw what the racebaiters were doing or could do to hold back the orderly growth of atlanta it infuriated me and eventually swung me to the extreme end opposite them in  a riot broke out in summerhill a neighborhood south of the atlanta stadium when a white police officer shot a black resident mayor allen rushed to the scene of the riot climbing a police car in an attempt to talk to and calm the crowd he toppled from the car uninjured when the crowd repeatedly rocked the vehicle afterwards he walked the streets – refusing to wear a riot helmet as the police did – urging the black residents to please go home this is a good city he shouted help keep it that way and go home he had just one blemish on his racial policies as mayor which took place during his first year in office late in  the

help identify and bring home the bodies of  of atlantas art and business leaders who on an art appreciation tour died in the air france flight  plane crash at orly airport in paris many of the deceased had been personal friends of allen in his book allen wrote about going to paris immediately after the crash i realized how insignificant i was but i knew i had to assume the posture of representing these families and indeed the entire city of atlanta georgia i knew nothing about protocol foreign relations aviation international agreements or any of the other details i might become involved in i was nothing but the mayor of atlanta and a friend and neighbor of  people who had been killed at this same airport only the day beforethese were my lifelong friends this was my generation this was also the backbone of atlantas cultural society the citys leading patrons of the arts there was no precedent for this kind of agony in  allen made a very private commitment to himself and to his wife louise that he would not seek a third term in office this was not revealed to the public until january  when allen formally announced his decision at a meeting of the atlanta rotary club that year he refused to publicly endorse any particular candidate in the mayoral race until just days before the runoff between sam massell and rodney cook when reports surfaced suggesting that allens vicemayor and mayoralelect massell had abused his power as vicemayor through misuse of the atlanta police department on the sunday before the election allen called for a press conference and asked massell to immediately withdraw from consideration for an office which requires intuitive integrity and instinctive withdrawal from even the suspicion and appearance of evil despite the backlash he received allen wrote had my candidate rodney cook been involved in the same affair i am convinced i would have taken the same action – except i would have gone into greater detail to make the public fully understand the seriousness of the situation sam massell went on to win the election and succeed allen as the rd mayor of atlanta economic development of atlantaedit under mayor allens forward atlanta program the citys population grew more than  percent atlanta ranked in the top ten in the nation in downtown construction with more than  new buildings constructed and  new jobs created each year in  atlantas unemployment rate at one point plummeted to an astonishing  percent eleven of the citys twelve tallest buildings were constructed during the sixties and the atlanta international airport now hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport acquired its first direct international air routes and saw its ranking change from the tenthbusiest airport in the nation to the thirdbusiest in an attempt to manage the citys vast increase in traffic allen oversaw the early phases of construction of the interstate  perimeter and the downtown connector and presided over the creation of the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta which would take over the old atlanta transit system and build the marta rail system the  million memorial arts center now the woodruff arts center was established as a memorial to the victims of the  orly plane crash the  million atlanta civic center and the  million peachtree center complex were all built during allens mayoralty between  and  convention business in atlanta doubled with  delegates spending  million mayor allen also played a key role in bringing major league sports to atlanta in a politically risky move he backed the construction of the  million atlantafulton stadium which attracted the milwaukee braves baseball team in  the new nfl franchised falcons football team in  and the stlouis hawks basketball team arrived in   his building program with its emphasis on developing downtown was opposed by some of atlantas black leaders as not adequately meeting the need for lowincome housing despite the criticisms however there was more lowincome housing built during allens eight years as mayor than the entire thirty years prior to that allen wrote it is wonderful to be idealistic and to speak about human values but you are not going to be able to do one thing about them if you are not economically strong if there is any one slogan i lived by as mayor of atlanta that would be it civil rights and desegregationedit allens advocacy for african american rights originated from his business pragmatism he believed that to flourish atlanta must address its racial issues eventually however allen was deeply affected by daily firsthand dealings he faced with racial issues as well as the profound questions african american citizens posed to him about their humanity and the cultural system that refused to recognize them his pragmatic support of racial integration transformed rapidly into a conviction about the moral rightness of racial equality – a belief would lead allen to place himself at the center of a firestorm even before becoming mayor allen was involved in efforts to bring desegregation to atlanta for the sake of atlantas businesses and city image as president of the atlanta chamber of commerce he worked closely with judge at walden longtime africanamerican leader opie shelton vicepresident of the atlanta chamber of commerce and  owners and managers of atlantas leading department variety and chain stores to come to an agreement of the full desegregation of downtown stores and lunch counters on his first day in office he ordered all white and colored signs removed from city hall and desegregated the cafeteria this was the first of many steps he took to advance integration allen authorized black atlanta policemen to arrest whites hired the citys first black firefighters and quickly put atlanta ahead of every other city in the south as far as hiring black workers for positions other than the most menial jobs he painstakingly negotiated agreements for the accommodation of african americans at  private and public facilities including hotels swimming pools and restaurants many atlanta restaurants and other public facilities desegregated by mutual agreement between their owners and mayor allen before the passing of the civil rights act of  by january   major atlanta hotels and motels had publicly pledged to accept reservations regardless of race i wasnt so allfired liberal when i first moved into city hall allen wrote but when i saw what the racebaiters were doing or could do to hold back the orderly growth of atlanta it infuriated me and eventually swung me to the extreme end opposite them in  a riot broke out in summerhill a neighborhood south of the atlanta stadium when a white police officer shot a black resident mayor allen rushed to the scene of the riot climbing a police car in an attempt to talk to and calm the crowd he toppled from the car uninjured when the crowd repeatedly rocked the vehicle afterwards he walked the streets – refusing to wear a riot helmet as the police did – urging the black residents to please go home this is a good city he shouted help keep it that way and go home he had just one blemish on his racial policies as mayor which took place during his first year in office late in  the city erected a fence to separate a black neighborhood from a white neighborhood but was removed in the face of legal challenges just months later dr martin luther king jredit mayor allen challenged members of atlantas prestigious commerce club to accept african american businessmen when martin luther king jr won the nobel peace prize in  allen helped organize a person biracial banquet to honor him atlanta was kings hometown furthermore he shamed many of the white leaders in the city into supporting the event beyond pragmatic grounds many attended the dinner making it a turning point in atlantas race relations upon hearing that martin luther king jr had been shot in memphis mayor allen immediately rushed to the support of dr kings wife allen and his wife were with mrs king when it was confirmed that dr king was dead two days after dr kings assassination on april   he participated in a march across the west side of atlanta leading the way in a police car for the nearly four thousand black students walking in memory of dr king along with the atlantas police chief herbert jenkins he visited every black neighborhood in atlanta during the traumatic days between dr kings death and his funeral walking up and down the streets and reassuring the black community mayor allen went through great lengths to ensure the city remained peaceful when nearly two hundred thousand people gathered to mourn dr kings death kings widow coretta scott king honored allen with the martin luther king jr nonviolent peace prize in  testimony before congressedit i was convinced now that voluntary desegregation of public facilities worked out on a local level had gone as far as it was going to go in the south and much of the rest of the united states allen wrote it was obvious that the president was going to have to push through a very plain and airtight law that would once and for all abolish the practice of segregation and segregation as i intended to say in my testimony was the stepchild of slavery in  president john f kennedy made a direct request asking ivan allen jr to testify before the us congress in support of a federal law mandating public accommodations for african americans this law particularly directed at those restaurants and hotels in the south that continued to close their doors to blacks by arguing private property rights would force any private business however remotely involved in interstate commerce to open its doors to every person regardless of race against the counsel of even atlantas most prominent black leaders allen chose to go to washington and deliver his testimony knowing it would most likely ruin his political career and deeply affect his personal and business relationships nevertheless with the support of his wife and very few others allen risked his place in society his political future the safety of his family and ultimately his life to advocate the public accommodation of african americans on july   allen spoke before the us congress and the nation in support of what became the civil rights act of  he was the only prominent white southern elected official to do so as a result there were death threats made towards the allen family and many white friends and constituents never spoke to him again just one month after allens testimony dr martin luther king jr delivered his i have a dream speech also calling for racial equality and an end to discrimination later proving to be a very defining moment in the civil rights movement excerpts from allens testimony were published in newspapers the day after he spoke in front of congress i am firmly convinced that the supreme court insists the same fundamental rights must be held by every american citizen therefore any failure by congress to pass the civil rights bill would amount to an endorsement of private business setting up an entirely new status of discrimination throughout the nation i submit that it is not right to allow an americans citizenship to be changed merely as a matter of convenience i want to emphasize again that now is the time for legislative action we cannot dodge this issue we cannot look back over our shoulders or turn the clock back to the eighteensixties we must take action now to assure a greater future for our citizens and our country now the elimination of segregation which is slaverys stepchild is a challenge to all of us to make every american free in fact as well as in theory allen described that to be the moment which made civil rights a very personal matter to him i have to be honest with myself and admit that up until the time i had to make the decision to go to washington or not go my liberalism on the race issue had been based to a large degree on the pragmatism it was simply good business for atlanta to be an open city a fair city a city too busy to hate a city trying to raise the level of its poorest citizens and get them off the relief rolesi am certain that at this point i had finally crossed over and made my commitment on a very personal basis and i think i took some of my friends with me allen continued to engage racial issues throughout his eight years in office he worked closely with martin luther king jr and the southern christian leadership conference by the time he stepped down atlanta was at the forefront of progress in public accommodations school desegregation voting rights housing and employment black citizens occupied positions on the city board of aldermen and the board of education familyedit ivan allen jr married louise richardson allen – granddaughter of the influential atlanta businessman hugh t inman on new years day in  they were married for sixtysix years before

very private commitment to himself and to his wife louise that he would not seek a third term in office this was not revealed to the public until january  when allen formally announced his decision at

reports surfaced suggesting that allens vicemayor and mayoralelect massell had abused his power as vicemayor through misuse of the atlanta police department on the sunday before the election allen called for a press conference and asked massell to immediately withdraw from consideration for an office which requires intuitive integrity and instinctive withdrawal from even the suspicion and appearance of evil despite the backlash he received allen wrote had my candidate rodney cook been involved in the same affair i am convinced i would have taken the same action – except i would have gone into greater detail to make the public fully understand the seriousness of the situation sam massell went on to win the election and succeed allen as the rd mayor of atlanta economic development of atlantaedit under mayor allens forward atlanta program the citys population grew more than  percent atlanta ranked in the top ten in the nation in downtown construction with more than  new buildings constructed and  new jobs created each year in  atlantas unemployment rate at one point plummeted to an astonishing  percent eleven of the citys twelve tallest buildings were constructed during the sixties and the atlanta international airport now hartsfieldjackson atlanta international airport acquired its first direct international air routes and saw its ranking change from the tenthbusiest airport in the nation to the thirdbusiest in an attempt to manage the citys vast increase in traffic allen oversaw the early phases of construction of the interstate  perimeter and the downtown connector and presided over the creation of the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority marta which would take over the old atlanta transit system and build the marta rail system the  million memorial arts center now the woodruff arts center was established as a memorial to the victims of the  orly plane crash the  million atlanta civic center and the  million peachtree center complex were all built during allens mayoralty between  and  convention business in atlanta doubled with  delegates spending  million mayor allen also played a key role in bringing major league sports to atlanta in a politically risky move he backed the construction of the  million atlantafulton stadium which attracted the milwaukee braves baseball team in  the new nfl franchised falcons football team in  and the stlouis hawks basketball team arrived in   his building program with its emphasis on developing downtown was opposed by some of atlantas black leaders as not adequately meeting the need for lowincome housing despite the criticisms however there was more lowincome housing built during allens eight years as mayor than the entire thirty years prior to that allen wrote it is wonderful to be idealistic and to speak about human values but you are not going to be able to do one thing about them if you are not economically strong if there is any one slogan i lived by as mayor of atlanta that would be it civil rights and desegregationedit allens advocacy for african american rights originated from his business pragmatism he believed that to flourish atlanta must address its racial issues eventually however allen was deeply affected by daily firsthand dealings he faced with racial issues as well as the profound questions african american citizens posed to him about their humanity and the cultural system that refused to recognize them his pragmatic support of racial integration transformed rapidly into a conviction about the moral rightness of racial equality – a belief would lead allen to place himself at the center of a firestorm even before becoming mayor allen was involved in efforts to bring desegregation to atlanta for the sake of atlantas businesses and city image as president of the atlanta chamber of commerce he worked closely with judge at walden longtime africanamerican leader opie shelton vicepresident of the atlanta chamber of commerce and  owners and managers of atlantas leading department variety and chain stores to come to an agreement of the full desegregation of downtown stores and lunch counters on his first day in office he ordered all white and colored signs removed from city hall and desegregated the cafeteria this was the first of many steps he took to advance integration allen authorized black atlanta policemen to arrest whites hired the citys first black firefighters and quickly put atlanta ahead of every other city in the south as far as hiring black workers for positions other than the most menial jobs he painstakingly negotiated agreements for the accommodation of african americans at  private and public facilities including hotels swimming pools and restaurants many atlanta restaurants and other public facilities desegregated by mutual agreement between their owners and mayor allen before the passing of the civil rights act of  by january   major atlanta hotels and motels had publicly pledged to accept reservations regardless of race i wasnt so allfired liberal when i first moved into city hall allen wrote but when i saw what the racebaiters were doing or could do to hold back the orderly growth of atlanta it infuriated me and eventually swung me to the extreme end opposite them in  a riot broke out in summerhill a neighborhood south of the atlanta stadium when a white police officer shot a black resident mayor allen rushed to the scene of the riot climbing a police car in an attempt to talk to and calm the crowd he toppled from the car uninjured when the crowd repeatedly rocked the vehicle afterwards he walked the streets – refusing to wear a riot helmet as the police did – urging the black residents to please go home this is a good city he shouted help keep it that way and go home he had just one blemish on his racial policies as mayor which took place during his first year in office late in  the city erected a fence to separate a black neighborhood from a white neighborhood but was removed in the face of legal challenges just months later dr martin luther king jredit mayor allen challenged members of atlantas prestigious commerce club to accept african american businessmen when martin luther king jr won the nobel peace prize in  allen helped organize a person biracial banquet to honor him atlanta was kings hometown furthermore he shamed many of the white leaders in the city into supporting the event beyond pragmatic grounds many attended the dinner making it a turning point in atlantas race relations upon hearing that martin luther king jr had been shot in memphis mayor allen immediately rushed to the support of dr kings wife allen and his wife were with mrs king when it was confirmed that dr king was dead two days after dr kings assassination on april   he participated in a march across the west side of atlanta leading the way in a police car for the nearly four thousand black students walking in memory of dr king along with the atlantas police chief herbert jenkins he visited every black neighborhood in atlanta during the traumatic days between dr kings death and his funeral walking up and down the streets and reassuring the black community mayor allen went through great lengths to ensure the city remained peaceful when nearly two hundred thousand people gathered to mourn dr kings death kings widow coretta scott king honored allen with the martin luther king jr nonviolent peace prize in  testimony before congressedit i was convinced now that voluntary desegregation of public facilities worked out on a local level had gone as far as it was going to go in the south and much of the rest of the united states allen wrote it was obvious that the president was going to have to push through a very plain and airtight law that would once and for all abolish the practice of segregation and segregation as i intended to say in my testimony was the stepchild of slavery in  president john f kennedy made a direct request asking ivan allen jr to testify before the us congress in support of a federal law mandating public accommodations for african americans this law particularly directed at those restaurants and hotels in the south that continued to close their doors to blacks by arguing private property rights would force any private business however remotely involved in interstate commerce to open its doors to every person regardless of race against the counsel of even atlantas most prominent black leaders allen chose to go to washington and deliver his testimony knowing it would most likely ruin his political career and deeply affect his personal and business relationships nevertheless with the support of his wife and very few others allen risked his place in society his political future the safety of his family and ultimately his life to advocate the public accommodation of african americans on july   allen spoke before the us congress and the nation in support of what became the civil rights act of  he was the only prominent white southern elected official to do so as a result there were death threats made towards the allen family and many white friends and constituents never spoke to him again just one month after allens testimony dr martin luther king jr delivered his i have a dream speech also calling for racial equality and an end to discrimination later proving to be a very defining moment in the civil rights movement excerpts from allens testimony were published in newspapers the day after he spoke in front of congress i am firmly convinced that the supreme court insists the same fundamental rights must be held by every american citizen therefore any failure by congress to pass the civil rights bill would amount to an endorsement of private business setting up an entirely new status of discrimination throughout the nation i submit that it is not right to allow an americans citizenship to be changed merely as a matter of convenience i want to emphasize again that now is the time for legislative action we cannot dodge this issue we cannot look back over our shoulders or turn the clock back to the eighteensixties we must take action now to assure a greater future for our citizens and our country now the elimination of segregation which is slaverys stepchild is a challenge to all of us to make every american free in fact as well as in theory allen described that to be the moment which made civil rights a very personal matter to him i have to be honest with myself and admit that up until the time i had to make the decision to go to washington or not go my liberalism on the race issue had been based to a large degree on the pragmatism it was simply good business for atlanta to be an open city a fair city a city too busy to hate a city trying to raise the level of its poorest citizens and get them off the relief rolesi am certain that at this point i had finally crossed over and made my commitment on a very personal basis and i think i took some of my friends with me allen continued to engage racial issues throughout his eight years in office he worked closely with martin luther king jr and the southern christian leadership conference by the time he stepped down atlanta was at the forefront of progress in public accommodations school desegregation voting rights housing and employment black citizens occupied positions on the city board of aldermen and the board of education familyedit ivan allen jr married louise richardson allen – granddaughter of the influential atlanta businessman hugh t inman on new years day in

voluntary desegregation of public facilities worked out on a local level had gone as far as it was going to go in the south and much of the rest of the united states allen wrote it was obvious that the president was going to have to push through a very plain and airtight law that would once and for all abolish the practice of segregation and segregation as i intended to say in my testimony was the stepchild of slavery in  president john f kennedy made a direct request asking ivan allen jr to testify before the us congress in support of a federal law mandating public accommodations for

business however remotely involved in interstate commerce to open its doors to every person regardless of race against the counsel of even atlantas most prominent black leaders allen chose to go to washington and deliver his testimony knowing it would most likely ruin his political career and deeply affect his personal and business relationships nevertheless with the support of his wife and very few others allen risked his place in society his political future the safety of his family and ultimately his life to advocate the public accommodation of african americans on july   allen spoke before the us congress and the nation in support of what became the civil rights act of  he was the only prominent white southern elected official to do so as a result there were death threats made

calling for racial equality and an end to discrimination later proving to be a very defining moment in the civil rights movement excerpts from allens testimony were published in newspapers the day after he spoke in front of congress i am firmly convinced that the supreme court insists the same fundamental rights must be held by every american citizen therefore any failure by congress to pass the civil rights bill would amount to an endorsement of private business setting up an entirely new status of discrimination throughout the nation i submit that it is not right to allow an americans citizenship to be changed merely as a matter of convenience i want to emphasize again that now is the time for legislative action we cannot dodge this issue we cannot look back over our shoulders or turn the clock back to the eighteensixties we must take action now to assure a greater future for our citizens and our country now the elimination of segregation which is slaverys stepchild is a challenge to all of us to make every american free in fact as well as in theory allen described that to be the moment which made civil rights a very personal matter to him i have to be honest with myself and admit that up until the time i had to make the decision to go to washington or not go my liberalism on the race issue had been based to a large degree on the pragmatism it was simply good business for atlanta to be an open city a fair city a city too busy to hate a city trying to raise the level of its poorest citizens and get them off the relief rolesi am certain that at this point i had finally crossed over and made my commitment on a very personal basis and i think i took some of my friends with me allen continued to engage racial issues throughout his eight years in office he

country now the elimination of segregation which is slaverys stepchild is a challenge to all of us to make every american free in fact as well as in theory allen described that to be the moment which

issue had been based to a large degree on the pragmatism it was simply good business for atlanta to be an open city a fair city a city too busy to hate a city trying to raise the level of its poorest citizens and get them off the relief rolesi am certain that at this point i had finally crossed over and made my commitment on a very personal basis and i think i took some of my friends with me allen
