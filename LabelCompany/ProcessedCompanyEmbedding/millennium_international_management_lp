subject to our overall risk management compliance operational controls and hedging of aggregate exposures where appropriate our approach to the selection and oversight of trading teams is grounded in a philosophy of consistently seeking to generate incremental positive returns against a limited amount of risk exposure ie high sharpe ratio rather than outsized but more volatile absolute returns we prefer trading teams that produce small gains on winning days and smaller losses on losing days our goal is to have more winning days than losing ones we encourage our trading teams to pass on opportunities for outsized gains if they are accompanied by the risk of large losses in an effort to ensure that this philosophy is implemented in a consistent disciplined manner we calculate and set investment guidelines with each trading team investment strategies we follow an investment strategy that is broadly diversified global in scope and opportunistic with respect to investments each trading team pursues specific opportunity sets within a disciplined risk management framework at any given time we expect to have trading teams pursuing most of the following broad strategies
