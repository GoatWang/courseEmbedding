had hoped to jumpstart normal timelines and deliver a world class product at the end of last year during its limited initial release we challenged the best hackers in the world to exploit mgt sentinel unfortunately the product proved vulnerable on both the server and sensor side and was not foolproof as i had promised the company also was also hampered by corporate events that limited its access to capital and prevented it from quickly ramping up its tech team particularly in light of the termination of our planned merger agreement we have since restructured our technical team and engaged chris roberts the worldrenowned cybersecurity expert to replace our former interim chief technology officer under the lead direction of chris sentinel has completed a redesign and all issues uncovered by our hacker testing have been addressed mr roberts stated sentinel has been reengineered with a greater understanding of the latest exploits we know how the attackers work so sentinel has been enhanced to blend seamlessly within its environment by maintaining the appropriate port and service configurations sentinels advanced capabilities will monitor extraneous traffic to identify legitimate threats within seconds mr mcafee concluded im excited to announce that we are now at the stage that i can promise an outstanding product we expect prototypes in the next several weeks to give us success with
