investment overview although a new asset class for institutional investors the maritime industry is responsible for transporting over  of trade worldwide making it a key driver of global growth given the fundamentals of the industry shipping will continue to be a major factor in trade and a vital component of global supply chains a maritime investment strategy offers investors a unique means of accessing income potential for stable yield through longterm charters with high quality counterparties   diversification revenue drivers uncorrelated with traditional financial asset classes   global exposure ships carry a wide range of cargo with independent demand drivers sourced from a variety of industries and localized market factors   strategy flexibility a cyclical industry creates the opportunity for a variety of strategies with attractive entry points across sectors   investment approach our tested investment thesis is predicated upon the following attractive entry point depressed charter rates and ship valuations coupled with a global dependence on shipping   longterm demand drivers increased population and urbanization in the emerging markets will continue to drive infrastructure development which is reliant on the delivery of commodities facilitated by global shipping lanes   diversified investment strategy a strategic approach to investing across the riskreturn spectrum in order to capitalize on historically low asset valuations and the potential for longerterm steady income in an otherwise lowyielding environment   risks associated with investments in maritime assets generally an investment in the strategy is subject to certain risks associated with the ownership of maritime assets and the maritime industry in general including the burdens of ownership of maritimerelated assets local national and international economic conditions the supply and demand for assets the financial condition of operators buyers and sellers of assets changes in interest rates and the availability of credit which may render the sale or refinancing of assets difficult or impracticable changes in environmental laws and regulations planning laws and other governmental rules and fiscal and monetary policies environmental claims arising in respect of assets acquired with undisclosed or unknown defects or problems resulting in environmental liabilities or as to which inadequate reserves have been established changes in tax rates changes in energy prices negative developments in the economy that depress commercial transportation activity uninsured casualties force majeure acts terrorist and piracy events underinsured or uninsurable losses and other factors which are beyond the reasonable control of the strategy and the investment
