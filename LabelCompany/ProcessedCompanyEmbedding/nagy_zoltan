 bs babesbolyai university romania  phd babesbolyai university romania  research interests professor nagy’s research is characterized by the development and application of process systems engineering approaches and tools for engineered product design and optimal process operation with applications in pharmaceutical fine chemical biotechnology food and agrochemical industries our research combines modeling optimization and advanced control approaches with experimental investigations using modern measurement techniques with the generic aim to develop theoretically founded practical methodologies for complex processes with quantifiable system performance improvements that can be supported in an industrial environment crystallization systems engineering crysys the recent development in my group in the combination of multidimensional population balance modeling approaches and practical robust control techniques for better crystal engineering enables the design and optimal production of particulate products with tailored properties and significantly reduced variability in quality we develop novel control approaches that allow the control of size and shape distribution polymorphic form and purity of crystals these techniques are based on using complex mathematical models to predict the final product quality and perform optimization of the operating conditions so that the best product quality such as highest purity and therapeutic efficiency can be achieved in minimum time and cost in addition to the modelbased approaches modelfree control techniques for a variety of continuous and batch crystallization processes are also developed and evaluated in our crystallization systems engineering laboratory these are based on the direct use of a variety of process analytical technologies pat and provide rapid design and scaleup approaches for crystallization systems these techniques are investigated across broad scales from microfluidic and droplet crystallization systems to large scale industrial processes control for intelligent manufacturing systems of particulates we develop modelbased simultaneous design and control techniques for integrated process systems that consider the entire sequence of unit operation for particulate production and aim to lead to intensified energy efficient processes the control relevant investigation of the batch to continuous paradigm shift in manufacturing of solid products is also in the focus of our research process analytical technologies and composite sensor arrays within this research combined measurement techniques are developed to achieve robust control approaches for the simultaneous control of several product properties using combined modelbased and statistical modeling techniques these approaches are experimentally investigated currently for batch and continuous crystallization systems using our intelligent decision support and control software the crystallization process informatics system cryprins some of these research themes are developed in cooperation with the university of loughborough and the innovative manufacturing research center in continuous

toys are mainly designed for the tiny ones we design and produce them with manufactory methods one by one we obtain our materials from local merchants and produce them here in miskolc as well so they are absolutely local products – this we express everywhere the toys are constantly being improved focusing on uniqueness and functionalityaccording to our own experience and considering the results of science we wish to facilitate the infants’ effective improvement our babies senses do not function with full efficiency in the first few months in the beginning they only recognize blurry spots and sharp contrasts as for seeing especiallythe strong contrast of colours are the best for newborns because they can perceive the bold highcontrast color schemes and graphics the earliest these highcontrast colours truly captivate the babies keep their attention vigilant and are an excellent help in developing their visual skills and even encourage them to exercise too visual stimulation is essential for the proper development of the vision in the first six months –meaning they learn to see but black and white games also improve the ability to concentrate and increase physical activityour toys made of various textiles are ideal for this purpose our design has been evolved in this spirit in addition we specifically use typical boy and the girls motives and nice color scheme
