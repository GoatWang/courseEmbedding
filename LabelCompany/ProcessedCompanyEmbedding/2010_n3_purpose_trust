fujimoto  asad waqar malik  and alfred j park   school of computational science and engineering georgia institute of technology usa  national university of science and technology pakistan  ibm tj watson research center yorktown heights usa abstract cloud computing offers the ability to transparently provide computing services remotely to users through the internet freeing them of the burdens associated with managing computing resources and facilities it offers the potential to make parallel and distributed simulation capabilities much more widely accessible to users who are not experts in this technology and do not have ready access to high performance computing platforms however services hosted within the cloud can incur significant performance degradations this article discusses the potential benefits and technical challenges that arise in utilizing cloud platforms for parallel and distributed simulations and a potential solution approach  what is cloud computing cloud computing has been gaining much attention in recent years as a means of realizing a long soughtafter vision where computing is provided to consumers as a utility not unlike electricity water or natural gas as such it is revolutionizing portions of the it industry conducive to this computational model in contrast to the norm today where organizations potentially incur large capital expenditure capex costs to build and operate their own computing infrastructure and it services to meet the computing needs of local users cloud computing is a paradigm where computing services are implemented on servers that can be accessed by clients operating at remote locations throughout the internet hewitt  it is an approach where computing resources are provided as a service eg software as a service saas platform as a service paas and infrastructure as a service iaas these services are inherently flexible and agile where users can choose the granularity of service and pay for only the computing resources they need commercial cloud computing services have gained some inroads and success utilizing this paradigm amazon web services elastic compute cloud ec offers compute cycles and storage charged on an hourly and monthly basis respectively lizhe jie et al  ec provides virtualized hardware upon which users can build a wide variety of applications some higher level services eg storage management services are also provided microsoft s azure platform supports applications that are developed usingnet libraries google appengine provides an environment for creating web service applications that operate on google s infrastructure while ec offers a lowlevel version of the cloud where users can build their own software stacks over virtualized hardware azure and appengine offer successively higherlevel views and services trading off flexibility with increased functionality and ease of use cloud computing outsources computing infrastructure services to the cloud provider reducing or eliminating the need for organizations to offer extensive it hardware and services this may provide certain economic advantages to its users first the cloud provider may be able to provide computing infrastructure more affordably than a locally operated facility this is because the cloud provider can take advantage of certain economies of scale to reduce its operating costs in addition the operator can place its facilities in locations that offer lower cost electricity power cooling labor property costs andor taxes electricity and cooling now represents a large fraction eg a third of the operating costs of a modern datacenter while the cost of electricity in states such as california can be several times more than locations in idaho or washington scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  armbrust fox et al  the payasyougo cost structure of cloud computing is attractive if the computational requirements of users vary greatly over time cloud computing allows the amount of computational power that is used and the cost to expand and shrink according to the user s needs the alternative is to either overprovision the infrastructure within the users organization to meet the peak expected workload leaving the facility underutilized during periods of less intense usage or to create a lower cost facility that is unable to meet the demands offered at times of peak usage cloud computing represents a fusion of many related technologies and paradigms it includes concepts associated with paradigms such as grid utility and autonomous computing grid computing aggregates computational resources across different administrative domains so that they can act in concert to perform very large tasks grid computing is often heterogeneous and geographically detached aymerich fenu et al  applications of grid computing require a large number of processing cycles access to large amounts of data and can generate huge datasets autonomic computing ac is based on selfmanagement configuration healing and selfprotection an ac system uses a concept called closed control loops without any external input it monitors and controls the system it is a self adaptive system that dynamically changes its behavior in response to new situations and needs wang  utility computing is a provisioning model based on the idea of outsourcing and demand availability services and resources are provided to the end user and charged based on their usage haifeng galligan et al  cloud computing includes elements of these associated approaches and introduces new ways to interact with different services as compared to traditional clientserver architectures while there has been much research in cloud computing and related technologies comparatively little work have focused on their use in simulation especially parallel and distributed simulation there has been some work in federating distributed simulations utilizing the high level architecture hla over grids cai turner et al  xie teo et al  chen turner et al  pan turner et al  other related work includes webbased simulation reichenthal  fitzgibbons fujimoto et al  huang xiang et al  the extensible modeling and simulation framework xmsf for web services pullen brunton et al  object request broker orb based frameworks cholkar and koopman  d ambrogio and gianni  execution of parallel and distributed simulations over clouds represents an interesting opportunity but presents certain technical challenges as will be discussed next  parallel simulation in the cloud parallel discrete event simulation pdes refers to the execution of a discrete event simulation program across multiple processors typically this is done to scale simulations to larger configurations to increase the detail and fidelity of the model andor to reduce execution time fujimoto  as computational hardware becomes increasingly parallel eg multicore cpus with only modest clock speed improvements simulation developers must turn to exploit parallelism as a means to address performance concerns while cloud computing presents an intriguing means to offering traditional sequential simulation applications to users its use for parallel and distributed simulations is perhaps more compelling a significant impediment to the widespread exploitation of this technology has been the availability of suitable computing platforms cloud computing lowers the barrier to begin exploiting these technologies because it eliminates the need to purchase and more importantly operate and maintain high performance computing equipment at the local site further by providing parallel and distributed simulation software as a service cloud computing offers the ability to hide many of the complications of executing parallel and distributed simulation codes from the user offering the potential to make exploitation of this technology much less risky than is the case today scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  as such cloud computing can help to address a longstanding problem faced by the parallel and distributed simulation community to simplify exploitation of the technology by domain scientists and engineers who are not experts in parallel computation or parallel simulation techniques currently careful consideration of the hardware platform on which the simulation is to run must typically be performed to achieve good performance shielding the simulation modeler from the details of the underlying system details can accelerate the adoption and use of parallel and distributed simulation techniques a cloud platform offers certain advantages from a simulation software vendor s perspective as well offering and maintaining this technology on a wellknown stable platform such as a virtual cluster in ec is a much less daunting undertaking compared to offering software that is sufficiently general that it can operate effectively on whatever platforms and configurations users happen to have in place at their local site this reduces the costs associated with delivering parallel and distributed simulation products to end users further enhancing its attractiveness the appeal of cloud computing for high performance computing applications has not gone unnoticed by cloud computing vendors for example amazon s ec supports the message passing interface mpi the standard communications protocol used by messagebased parallel programs that run on clusters and supercomputers this provides a direct path to making parallel and distributed simulations at least those based on mpi readily available to end users of the cloud but this is not to say that parallel and distributed simulation in the cloud is a certainty nor is it straightforward indeed many key issues remain many of these concern cloud environments in general and are not specific to parallel or distributed simulation for example users must be assured that proprietary and confidential data will be secure in a cloud environment before they will consider such a move services must be reliable nearly always available secure and resistant to cyber attacks further execution of parallel and distributed simulations in cloud environments introduces additional issues as will be discussed next preliminary work in benchmarking parallel scientific programs in amazon s ec provides some insight into the technical issues that will arise in executing parallel and distributed simulations in a cloud environment walker  ekanayake and fox  it has been observed that parallel scientific codes executed over ec ran significantly slower compared to execution on dedicated nodes of a cluster two issues are communications and interference data processing applications using paradigms such as mapreduce dean and ghemawat  have enjoyed much success in cloud environments but do not require extensive communications among computing tasks that arise in parallel and distributed simulation codes cloud environments are often better at providing high bandwidth communications among applications than in providing low latency walker  this is problematic for many simulation applications that are accustomed to sending many small messages requiring quick delivery rather than fewer large messages requiring high bandwidth alone cloud environments are shared among many users and individual users are not guaranteed exclusive access to the processors assigned to that user s virtual cluster in principle gang scheduling techniques can be used to ensure an individual users is allocated a set of physical nodes at the same time instant however this property may not be guaranteed by the cloud provider this can lead to difficulties for parallel simulation applications especially those that utilize optimistic synchronization techniques interactive distributed simulations require that simulation computations be completed to meet hard or soft real time constraints response time guarantees would have to be provided by the cloud provider to fulfill this requirement scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  in the following we describe an approach that utilizes the masterworker paradigm for executing parallel and distributed simulation codes developed for volunteer computing and desktop grid applications this approach features properties such as bulk communication rather than transmitting many small messages automated support for fault tolerance and load balancing and migrating computations to the data that are advantageous in the cloud in a companion paper to appear later we describe an optimistic synchronization protocol to address the interference problem  aurora here we adopt terminology used in parallel discrete event simulation pdes specifically a pdes program consists of a collection of logical processes lps that communicate by exchanging time stamped messages here we use the terms events and messages synonymously unless stated otherwise each lp is a sequential discrete event simulation that operates by processing events in time stamp order to model the evolution of the system over time the computation associated with each event involves modifying state variables to reflect changes in the system occurring at that instant in time and possibly scheduling new events with timestamp in the simulated future the masterworker paradigm is a mechanism for dividing up a potentially large computation into smaller portions of work that can be distributed to a pool of workers operating under the direction of a master controller although this concept has been wellstudied in the general distributed computing literature it has not been extensively explored for parallel discrete event simulation codes the masterworker paradigm is well suited for cloud computing environments unlike traditional pdes codes that rely on frequent exchange of small messages among lps the masterworker approach features an automated bundling process that aggregates messages destined for different destinations and transmits them as one unit achieving better utilization of the high bandwidth relatively high latency interconnect in cloud environments further by caching the state of lps among the worker nodes the execution mechanism has the effect of migrating computations to the data a strategy that has proven to be successful in data intensive computing applications in environments based on the mapreduce paradigm frequently found in clouds general distributed computing software does not have the same requirements as those of pdes programs and thus infrastructure must be specifically designed to support this simulation environment traditional masterworker systems lease work units to workers for execution for example anderson cobb et al  divides received radio telescope data into portions that workers can download for analysis these work units are timeindependent from other workers and require no communication between workers as they perform computations as leased by the master these conditions simplify the runtime requirements of the underlying masterworker infrastructure and are inadequate to support pdes in conventional pdes systems a simulation consists of many logical processes that communicate by exchanging timestamped messages as the simulation progresses the first important difference in a masterworker pdes system is that the lp state must be tracked and stored some general distributed computing projects only require a simplifying result at the end of their computation however a pdes system must maintain the state of the lp that may be leased to a different worker at a later time furthermore the pdes system must ensure that these timestamped messages are delivered in the correct order to the proper destination lp to preserve the local causality constraint lcc therefore in addition to correctly ordering messages sent between lps these messages must be maintained for future delivery to any lp or collection of lps that are leased as a work unit to an available worker moreover work units must be properly constrained for execution as processing events and messages arbitrarily into the future may violate the lcc therefore conservative or optimistic time management schemes must be scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  employed alongside lp and work unit management in a masterworker pdes system proxy message message message work unit work unit work unit worker figure  overview of interaction between different backend services and a worker during a typical simulation these key differences and requirements between general distributed computing programs and pdes in a masterworker paradigm is the impetus for the aurora system however the need for highly scalable and high performance distributed simulations drive the architecture for the system which is described next the description of the aurora architecture described next is based on that presented in fujimoto park et al   conceptual overview the masterworker paradigm promotes a clear separation between the controller and workers that perform computation on the work unit passed to them by the master the aurora architecture divides the master infrastructure into three main backend services as shown in figure  these services include a proxy one or multiple work unit state servers and one or multiple work unit message state servers the distributed nature of the backend services helps to ensure scalability and robustness of the aurora system these backend services communicate over tcpip sockets the aurora workers perform the actual simulation computation by contacting the proper backend services to download simulation state and associated messages per work unit lease computation is done locally independent of other workers once the computation completes the final state and messages are uploaded to the work unit state and message state servers this process repeats for a specified number of times or until the simulation reaches its end time as shown in figure  the worker only contacts backend services pertinent to its own execution as directed by the proxy due to the addition of support for multiple concurrent simulations aurora uses the concept of simulation packages simpkg a simulation package contains all the runtime parameters of the simulation such as the number of work units a lookahead connectivity graph simulation begin and end times wallclock time deadlines per work unit lease and possible initial states these specifications are uploaded to the proxy service where necessary metadata and allocation of resources is done prior to starting the simulation and allowing workers to execute  aurora proxy the aurora proxy service is the central core controller that oversees the simulation and the other two backend components internal managers handle the other services the work unit state and message state servers are controlled by independent managers within the proxy that keep track of metadata such as worker keys server ip addresses and simulation package to work unit storage allocation the proxy contains three managers state server manager message state server manager and a simulation package manager see figure  the work unit state server manager holds control information such as state server ip addresses and a list of work units of a simulation package the server is hosting the message state server manager operates similarly to the state server scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  except that it keeps track of message state servers instead of work unit state servers work unit proxy work unit state connection state s tm connection message state simulation message connection tso message queues worker figure  internal metadata and state management the baseline functionality for both the work unit state server and message state server are inherited from a common manager class but is kept separate at the implementation level for caching mechanisms which will be distinct whether the server is supporting atomic work unit states or individual time stamped messages the simulation manager stores the metadata of a simulation package and performs any work related to simulation packages and its associated work units for example when a simulation package is uploaded the simulation manager finds space on available servers where work unit and future message state can be stored worker requests for work are passed to the simulation managers for leasing duties as well as to keep track of which work units have been leased or locked down to prevent further leasing the simulation manager instantiates time managers as specified by the simulation package time managers hold information regarding leased work unit simulation times these managers are responsible for computing safe processing bounds for any given work unit time managers may employ conservative or optimistic time management schemes or a possible combination of both the implementation described here uses a centralized conservative time management mechanism  work unit and message state services the other components of the aurora backend service are the work unit and message state servers the work unit server contains the current values of state vectors for each work unit and the simulation time for which this state is valid these work unit states are applicationdefined contiguous blocks of memory and are handled by pack and unpack procedures overwritten by the aurora workers the message state server is similar to the state server except that instead of storing the state of work units future messages are stored in timestamp order according to their destination work unit these services can be easily adapted for optimistic and caching routines by simply storing state and message state histories instead of discarding previous values upon state and message updates although distribution of the workload among the proxy work unit state and message state servers has increased scalability and performance much of the future performance potential of the aurora system lies in exploiting optimistic execution and employing caching mechanisms these services include the baseline architecture for these types of performance enhancements  workers and work unit lifecycle the aurora workers perform work as dictated by the master comprised of the proxy and associated state servers the aurora worker will scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  perform iterations of a work unit lifecycle as specified at run time this lifecycle is comprised of four major steps  initialization  work unit setup  applicationdefined execution and  work unit finalization the initialization step is typically done only one time when the worker starts up this step includes thread initialization signal handler setup and commandline parsing after this step completes the work unit begins the setup and download phase to populate the worker with the proper state variables and messages to process for the leased simulation execution time the steps for the work unit setup are performed in the following order  worker key request  request work unit and metadata  populate internal metadata structures and create a work unit manager if necessary  contact state server and download state  contact message state server and download messages  unpack work unit state  unpack work unit messages and populate the incoming message queue in timestamp order a worker key is a unique identifier issued to the worker upon first contact by the proxy the worker uses its key to identify itself in future communications once a unique worker key is issued the worker performs a work unit request where the proxy may or may not lease a work unit to the requesting worker if a work unit is available to be leased associated metadata about the work unit is downloaded from the proxy service internally the worker will then set up supporting data structures for the impending work unit once this step has completed the worker will then contact the proper work unit state and message state servers and download the packed information the work unit state is then processed by the applicationdefined unpack method to load current state variables the message states are automatically unpacked by the aurora worker into a timestamp ordered priority queue for processing by the worker during the simulation execution after the work unit setup has completed the applicationdefined simulation execution method is invoked and the simulation runs until the end time as specified during the work unit metadata download step  of the work unit setup during the simulation execution if the work unit detects a message that is destined for another work unit it will perform a destination message server lookup this is performed in a separate thread from the main execution loop and the result is cached for future use when the simulation reaches the end time as specified by the proxy work unit finalization begins which is the final step in the work unit lifecycle this process is comprised of seven steps  pack final state  pack future messages destined for itself  contact proxy to begin consistency convergence  collate and pack future messages destined for other work units by message state server keys deliver collated messages to the proper message state servers  upload work unit state to state server  upload messages packed in step  to message state servers  receive consistency convergence verification from proxy the first step calls an applicationdefined method for packing the final state into a contiguous area of memory for upload to the state server next the worker packages any remaining unprocessed messages on the timestamp ordered message queue which may have been created by sending messages during simulation execution by the work unit to itself the worker then initiates a consistency convergence to the proxy a consistency convergence locks down the work unit so it may not be leased again or updated in multiple lease scenarios this allows atomic commits and prevents inconsistent updates of updated work unit and message states the worker then begins a message collation process where future messages destined for work units that reside on the same physical message state server are packed together this reduces the frequency of smaller message updates and allows the workers to update groups of messages at one time after scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  this process completes the final state and future messages destined for the work unit are uploaded to the appropriate servers the final step is a verification of consistency convergence from the proxy that the process was completed successfully without errors on the backend during steps  the aurora state and message state servers send messages to the proxy indicating updates to their respective states the proxy acknowledges these messages and tracks the consistency convergence process the final result of the update is returned to the worker  performance for a performance evaluation of the aurora system a torus queuing network was used to compare the impact of work unit granularity and the amount of work per work unit lease on overall system throughput in this simulation servers can be aggregated into subnets that can then be mapped to single work units in this study the coarsegrained queuing network was configured as a  server x closed torus network with  partitions of x torus subnets the finegrained queueing network was configured as a  server x closed torus network partition into x torus subnets that can be leased as work units the coarsegrained simulation had internal links within each work unit with a delay of  microseconds and external work unittowork unit delays of  millisecond the finegrained simulation had the external delay set at  milliseconds while the internal delay remained unchanged both simulation scenarios generated  jobs destined for internal servers and  jobs destined for servers external to the work unit additionally both scenarios had job service times exponentially distributed with a mean of  microseconds the differences in simulation parameters ensured significant differences of work in each work unit lease a total of  processors consisting of heterogeneous architectures were used in this performance evaluation  processors in two compute nodes were comprised of way mhz pentium iii machines with  gb of memory per node and the remaining  processors were pentium xeon ghz smt enabled processors across  nodes with  gb of memory per node the aurora backend was run on three pentium xeon ghz machines with  gb of memory each all machines were running redhat linux and had fast ethernet among each set of similar processors but on disparate lans between machine types the backend setup for the coarse and fine scenario contained  work unit state server and  message state server whereas the fine  scenario used  work unit server and  message state servers for the figures below deferred refers to the amount of wallclock time seconds a worker spends waiting for a valid work unit lease from the backend import indicates to the amount of time the worker downloads work unit metadata work unit state vectors messages and the associated time spent in the applicationdependent deserialization routine finalize is the time to perform the logical inverse of import where the work unit state and messages are serialized and consistency convergence is achieved on the backend services for the returning work unit application is the time spent executing application simulation code the overheads for the coarse and finegrained simulations are detailed in figure  as expected the coarsegrained simulation incurred much less overhead than the finegrained simulations for the finegrained simulations the majority of the time spent is in the work unit overheads most notably the work unit finalization and import with an additional message state server available we can observe a reduction in overhead time in the fine  scenario figure  details the global event throughput for each of the scenarios although the coarsegrained simulation was expected to have higher event throughput than the finegrained simulations due to less overhead the fine  scenario showed gains through the addition of only one more message state server resulting in a  increase in event throughput  concluding remarks cloud computing offers the promise of outsourcing the task of providing and managing execution platform to users while hiding many of the complicated details of pdes execution scs ms magazine   n july fujimoto et al  page  of  as such it offers the possibility of making parallel and distributed simulation technology much more readily accessible to the simulation community as cloud computing environments become more common their use for parallel and distributed simulations become more attractive figure  processor time breakdown in this article we attempted to highlight some of the benefits and important challenges associated with executing parallel and distributed simulation in cloud environments and suggested some possible solutions that have been implemented and observed this work only represents an initial step in executing parallel and distributed codes in cloud computing environments there are many avenues for future research as noted earlier use of the cloud for interactive parallel and distributed simulations is an open area of study experience with simulation application codes in cloud environments is limited and development frameworks and tools are needed security and reliability issues merit greater attention a mechanism for auto tuning parallel and distributed codes to improve the convenience for users is an area that will require further
