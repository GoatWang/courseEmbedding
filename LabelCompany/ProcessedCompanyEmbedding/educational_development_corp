educational development corp is it an mlm or a direct seller part   educational development corporation nasdaqeduc  seeking alphasign in  join nowgoÂ»educational development corp is it an mlm or a direct seller part jun  about educational development educ gregory stefflre value registered investment advisor longterm horizon special situationssummaryeducs rapid growth may not be all that it appearseduc is growing because of consultants but consultants arent stayingcash flows have become a problem for educ and we might know why educational development corp nasdaqeduc is a small company that recently reported large yearoveryear revenue growth the company is reporting record net revenues for example on may  it announced a  growth in revenue year over year this type of growth can be extremely positive however in the case of educ the growth in sales is not as great as one might suspect i plan on describing the issues in a twopart series this first article will look at the financials of the business and how they are changing over time and the second article will examine more qualitative issues educ is growing at unsustainable levels and it is impacting the financial performance of the company a sleepy stable and profitable business is being changed into a high growth low profitability and potentially volatile business recently the longtime ceo has become more aggressive in promoting the business and has touted somewhat irrelevant metrics of success this all comes at a detriment to the cash flows and financial viability of the company educ is a distributor and publisher of childrens books it distributes books produced by usborne publishing of the uk educ also publishes a line of books under the kane miller nameplate in the most recent k found online educ reports that in fy   of its revenues are from home business divisionubam ubam division and the publishing division contributed the other  ubam is described as follows this division distributes books nationwide through independent consultants who hold book showings in individual homes through social media book fairs with school and public libraries and internet sales these consultants can earn commission on the sales of individuals they bring into the educ mix this is known as multilevel marketing or mlm the publishing unit by contrast markets books to large and small book stores as well as other specialty stores key question is educ an mlm or a direct sales retailer disguised as an mlm educ has shifted over time from a traditional distributor of books to an mlm this isnt inherently a bad thing because the book industry has been decimated by the rise of amazon nasdaqamzn with the closing of hundreds of book stores this shift may be prudent but mlms have potential issues by virtue of how they are structured that should give conservative investors some pause for the most recent year ending feb   educ reported net revenues of  million the net revenue number presented in the financials as follows gross sales   discounts  allowances   transportation revenues  net sales  if an investor makes a chart looking at the historical gross sales vs the historical net sales it would look like the following you can see that from about  to  the company averaged around  million in net sales and  million in net sales there was basically no growth for an entire year period then in  net sales jumped to  million and in  net sales jumped to  million in the most recent k ceo randall white was quoted as saying the following fiscal year  is the second straight year of amazing revenue growth we exceeded the m annual sales hurdle for the first time in the companys history and achieved record earnings per share this success could not have occurred without the incredible effort of our ubam sales consultants and the hard work of our office and warehouse employees key question  is educ really a  million dollar company my research may indicate thats misleading whenever i study a new business i try to peel back the layers to determine the financials of the core operating business in the case of educ i decided to adjust these sales numbers my goal is to try and determine how much money is being generated from the sale of books here is what my  adjusted numbers look like i will walk you through the rationale behind each adjustment i start with the same gross number and the same discounts  allowances numbers shipping costs should be taken out to determine net revenues the first change you will see is that i am adding back  million to the transportation revenues why  million represents the costs to ship books to customers i understand that it may be weird for some to remove an expense from a revenue number but there is a reason some companies make money on shipping and handling charges which may be attractive business model separate from the selling of products but in the case of educ the shipping costs are more than the revenue it is charging for shipping the products thus in essence the gross revenue number is subsidizing the cost of shipping and thus a portion of the sales numbers is not related to the selling of books here is a simple example of what i mean lets say i sell an item for  with free shipping vs selling an item for    shipping my gross revenues would be the same in either case but in the  revenue figure lies some portion of that revenue necessary for shipping the item but lets say that it cost me  to ship the item to the person then my  shipping revenue does not cover the cost in that instance the company is subsidizing the extra  in sales in scenario one i am saying that we should show      the price we realized for the item is  same with scenario         under the approach by educ it would show the following    or  in net revenues or  in product sales and  in shipping revenues and the  shipping charges show up as an expense further down the line commissions also should be removed to determine product sales the benefit of an mlm structure is that you can pay less in traditional overhead marketing  advertising expenses because you have a sales force that is working for you but you do not have the burden of those expenses you can also pay less in advertising costs however the expenses show up as commissions or rebates to the consultants who work for you in mlms commissions are often a form of a discount to the stated retail price we can see this issue in the financials the percentage of net revenue that educ is spending on advertising is going down note advertising is stated in educs selling and operating line item thus these commissions are in essence a form of discounts that again are embedded in the sales figures once we remove these two hidden costs that are in the revenue number we can see that the company is selling significantly less product than what may appear at first blush if i recreate the first chart provided above you can see the following as you might expect there is no change to the gross revenue numbers but there is a dramatic change to the net sales numbers my approach is suggesting that the company actually sold only  million in product versus  million to be  clear i am not in any way saying that educ management is wrong for reporting the numbers the way it has what i am saying is that for investors and eventually for management laying out or thinking about the sales in this regard gets closer to the real economics of the business also you could have done this several different ways for me i want to know what the company is doing in product sales i am suggesting that the commissions being paid to the consultants is a discount or rebate that should be accounted for in the top line also i am suggesting that when a company charges lower shipping than what it costs to ship the item then the revenue number should account for this fact the changes i am making do not change any of the final net numbers the chart below provides you a condensed income statement for  on the left is the stated income statement and the right shows how my adjustments impact the income statement but this approach can change how you think about the business and the growth in other areas the growth in sales is dramatically slower than what may appear under the traditional method presented by educ the sales from  to  would have grown by a little over  under my method the real product sales only grew at little over  it is paying more to ship the items and paying higher commissions which the net sales numbers do not reveal we can also use this data to see what the historical trends have been if i take the new adj revenue number as a percentage of gross sales we see that the company is capturing less and less of the reported gross revenue number under my approach what you are seeing is that the percentage of product sales related to the stated gross number is going down the absolute numbers are growing in  the product sales were  of the stated gross number and in the fiscal year ending  they were  note i am showing the additional hidden shipping cost because i am not adding back the transportation revenue gross margin structure is completely different under this approach the following chart shows how educ thinks about the business in  the gross margin as a percentage of net revenues would be  and that has been improving over the past several years if we use the adjusted numbers here is what we get you can see the companys actual gross margin on products is a lot lower than what might appear also we can see that the growth in cost of goods sold is about half of what the sales might have indicated while educ is growing at over  its suppliers sales are only growing at  as you sell more you can get bigger discounts from suppliers which would account for some of the difference but not all educ is holding onto less and less consultants educ defines current active consultants as someone who has sales within the last six months p  management likes to explain that the growth in sales is coming from the growth in the number of consultants and the absolute numbers show this transition in the chart above you can see that the number of new consultants and active consultants has grown dramatically but what isnt so clear from the chart is how many old consultants are sticking around so i created an addition to the chart and provide you with a copy below in this chart i have added an old consultants line which is the number of active consultants minus the number of new consultants i then took this result and set as a percentage of active consultants so what is happening we can see that the number of old consultants as a percentage of active consultants has dropped to  in the past the number has ranged from  to  educ is a direct seller of books this suggests that educ is shifting its business model to a direct seller of products rather than a traditional mlm why the consultants who sign up are not really interested in sticking around to sell the books they are interested in purchasing the books at a discount and then moving on here is a screenshot of the pitch to join usborne books as consultant from the same page you can find the new consultant kit information i have copied the screenshot below educ offers you two different kits for becoming a consultant the first one costs  and the second one costs  both these packages include free shipping if you purchase the  kit you are getting a total of  books two featured and eight other books for a value of  if you purchase the  you are getting three featured books and  other books and no you do not get to pick the books that you think are most relevant for your audience a look at the best sellers as most mlms do the join page talks a lot about financial security and becoming a business owner while the facts may suggest otherwise because we dont know which books you will get with your new consultant kit there is not an easy way to check these claims but here is my own attempt i went to the shop portion of the educ website found here i looked at the best sellers which show the  best sellers next i took those item numbers and prices and put them in excel i then went ahead and ordered that table by the most expensive books remember if you spent  you were entitled to a total of  books and if you spent  you are entitled a total  this chart is assuming that educ gives you the most expensive books and best sellers as part of your kit then the retail value of the books is  for the  kit and  for the  kit if a person sold all their books they would make the difference of  and  this does not include any expenses for running your business inventory issues the final area of concern is in regard to inventory noncurrent inventory is growing slower than what one might expect here is how educ reports noncurrent inventory k  p  certain inventory is maintained in a noncurrent classification management continually estimates and calculates the amount of noncurrent inventory noncurrent inventory arises due to occasional purchases of titles in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle due to minimum order requirements of our suppliers noncurrent inventory was estimated by management using the current year turnover ratio by title educ reports the inventory at the gross amount and then shows a line item for an inventory valuation allowance they do this for both current and noncurrent inventory when i input the data into excel here is what i got what you can see is that the value of net noncurrent inventory is going down on an absolute basis and as  of total inventory this could be correct but it just raises some concerns if you combine the net current inventory and the net noncurrent inventory then this would be the total inventory on the balance sheet i went further and provide how much the noncurrent inventory is as a percentage of the total net inventory that percentage has been going down dramatically the decrease could be a result of the faster sales or the growth in sales ie educ is clearing stuff and the inventory is not sitting on the shelves for as long but the comment provided above in regards to buying inventory that would not be sold in a normal business cycle in order to meet minimums would seem to suggest otherwise the concern is that management may be buying too much inventory to get minimums to show increase in gross margins and then not marking that inventory down to noncurrent remember our blind box consultant kit for  to  well what if a title is getting old on the shelves such that it would need to be reported as noncurrent management could plop one of those titles into the box and then claim that is still current inventory summary in this article my goal was to show you different ways to check the status of the underlying core business there may be good business reasons for why these things are happening but investors should try to answer these questions for themselves in the next article i plan to address how these financial issues are possibly impacting the company and point out some other areas concerns that are more qualitative in nature i have no financial interest in this company long or short nor do i have any derivative investment long or short any errors in the article are

situationssummarycorporate governance seems to be lacking at educis educ going to have to issue equitythe growth is coming at a cost to the shareholders this is part  of my series on educational development corporation nasdaq educ the last article focused on walking readers through some of the financial issues with the rapid growth of the company this article will focus on more qualitative issues the primary focus of this article is on possible corporate governance issues doing investment research is a lot liking doing a puzzle except you do not have the benefit of having a cover with a picture to guide you along you sit and try picking up different pieces to see if they fit together in the case of educ i am laying out a bunch of different pieces that dont seem to fit while any one issue raised by itself may not be that important as the list gets longer and longer it raises some questions no more dividend the first issue is the fact that educ has suspended their dividend in its entirety on feb   educ filed an k announcing the dividend suspension here is what they had to say the company has experienced extraordinary growth the past two years net revenues in fiscal year  were  million fiscal year   million and fiscal year ending february  projected to reach  million this growth has required the company to invest in additional inventory warehouse fulfillment equipment and software upgrades management believes it is in the best interest of the shareholders to suspend the dividend and focus all resources and cash requirements toward financing future growth up until this point educ paid a dividend since  i do not have a problem with a company cutting a dividend if it is because they are investing in profitable growth but as my article suggests the real reason the company is cutting the dividend is because the business is becoming less and less profitable first cfo and management changes i understand that small companies are not always run the same as larger companies but educ just hired their first official cfo dan okeefe was appointed cfo effective march   he took over for marilyn pinney whose title was controller principal financial officer and corporate secretary who had resigned march   what marilyn resigned who knew while the k was filed with the sec on  this k lists the management changes described above but what else is interesting is the fact that the company also attached a press release to this k when you read the press release which was issued on march   you can read about all the growth the company has experienced the company announced that the net revenues of  million but the press release makes no mention of the management changes that took place over a week earlier so apparently you have to go to the sec website to find out this news how about the companys own website i went to the following website address for educ investors at this link you can see that the company hasnt even updated their own website the last press releases were prior during  also financial websites like yahoo finance or seeking alpha only pull press releases and not usually the ks here is a snapshot from seeking alpha showing educs press releases who is craig white because of the above issues i wanted to see how long ms pinney had been the controller and corporate secretary since  also her age  i was able to see this in the most recent proxy statement but what struck me as odd was the executive compensation chart ms pinneys compensation wasnt listed on the executive compensation chart this just struck me as odd because you often see closer to five people on these types of lists but a smaller company could be different if you read the last line of the picture provided above you see that ms pinneys compensation was below  and thus not reported what you will also see is craig whites name on this form who is craig white randall white is the presidentchairmantreasurer of educ one might assume that he is the son of randall white but the filings do not disclose this information i had to go all the way back to annual report in  to find out that craig was in fact rons son you see educ used to make the following chart for investors most companies disclose this type of relationship to explain any appearance of potential conflicts of issue also you should note that craig joined the company right after college and then was promoted to head of information systems in a little over a year however this start date seems to be in question the chart above is from the most recent proxy statement filed  it says he has been in that role since  and the previous chart said he was appointed manager in july  also this section should raise the issue of why was ms pinney being paid less than craig in other words how do you justify paying a cio over  but not someone who is running the financials of the company is it because he is the son or is it because he deserves more for his work in this area surely the financials of the company should be important management has just started doing conference calls on january   management started doing investor calls not necessarily a bad thing but this was the first time i can find that the company hosted calls per crunchbase educ has been publicly traded since  the first conference call didnt go so well you can read the transcripts here the second call took place on june   and the transcript can be found here i appreciate the folksy manner of the calls but the calls also suggest that at minimum the company could use more financial discipline this section will highlight some of the issues with the conference calls issuing stock yes well no okay maybe who knows on feb   educ issued an k disclosing that they had no plans to issue equity here is the quote from the k on january   during an investor conference call held to discuss the financial results of educational development corporation the company for the quarter ended november   the company provided remarks that referred to our capital structure to clarify these statements the company has no plans to issue additional capital at this time then in the most recent conference call held on june  randall white had the following to say about the equity raising issue guys i guess i wasnt used to people hanging on my every word in that last call because i got a call that said what the heck they said the moment you said issue stock there were people getting off the call selling right there what i said was at some point in time well i hope i live that long but were a  million company and we have adequate financials financial backing financial resources to do what we need i would like to think at some point in time lets say when the stock is  how about that that we might issue a little bit randall white seems to be suggesting that people misunderstood his comments from the first call while i read the first call first and thought they were issuing equity as well then i read the second call and the k so i went back to the first call to see what was said there is a long discussion about how educ doesnt have access to capital to fund their rapid growth randall suggests that this is because of the way banks are analyzing his business note at the time they were not in compliance with their bank covenants because of the debt to equity ratio but i strongly encourage everyone to read the transcripts and form your own opinion randalls comments on equity in the first call so we are looking at a long range how to improve capital structure and someone has got to come up with some equity so we are looking at that it appears that this comment suggests that they were looking into issue equity but it does say long range so maybe randall was really thinking more of a longterm solution and not immediately in response to a question randall discusses the following tony i totally agree with you it is dilutive but if youve got a  million cap on your bank loan and youre going to go from  million to maybe  million you know you are going to do what youve got to do i dont have the answers all here but equity is one of them i do not want  my plan was if the profits had been comparable to the revenue and we had the stock at  to  it was  a year ago at  you put out  million shares from  million and get up to  million that is not dilutive at all and that is what i had in mind  i am not crazy about that i agree with you but a growing company cannot be totally funded on bank debt from this discussion we can see a couple of things first randall seems to understand that it would be dilutive to issue stock at  but he also says you are going to do what youve got to do then he goes on and says equity is one of the answers finally at the end he says that a company cannot be funded on bank debt this discussion says that equity was really being considered despite the negative issues it raises essentially that for the company to grow they would need the cash infusion in the first call randall describes the equity in relation to treasury stock another item i might point out is our the equity that is shown on the balance sheet is  million there is also nearly  million of treasury stock now the net or actually equity is  million less the  million treasury stock which could be considered an asset because that stock could be sold to provide equity capital which we talked to you about doing that in certain instances to increase our equity base randall views the treasury stock as an asset which can be utilized to raise money for the business and he goes further to say they had considered raising money by selling stock there seems to be a lot of discussion on the sale of equity in this conference call to allow a reasonable person to think that an equity raise was going to happen sooner rather than later also when you look at the financials of the business you get the sense that this will need to happen sooner or later it isnt hard to imagine a company which borrowed  from the owner to cover payroll stopped paying their dividend and is not in compliance at the time with the bank notes might be considering raising new capital through an equity offering educ did announce that on february   that they received an amendment to the loan waiving the noncompliance from their bank other issues with the call that are worth highlighting customer service  there is a section from the first call where randall is describing the shipping issues they ran into and how he likes when he gets a customer call after the customer has waited  hours on the phone in his mind this means they really wanted the product not exactly a great customer service oriented ceo i am not sure i want to wait  hours on the phone for a company best of luck  there is another section that may indicate how randall responds to any form of criticism this shareholder raises a question about the purchase of real estate he says the following randall i fully sympathize with your operational issues no small company could have coped with what happened to you operationally so i am sure you will get it worked out sooner or later however you made a big mistake in my opinion in putting by based on your description in the call today now  million worth of illiquid real estate on your balance sheet i think addressing that issue before you address expanding the equity in the company should be a top priority i think you should reverse the decision you and the board made to buy all that real estate i think it should be sold and leased back and i think the fact the stock is down from  to  well yes it is partially due to the operational issues a very big chunk of it is due to the market simply displacing debt for equity value in the marketplace you still have an enterprise value of  to  a share but a big chunk of it is debt and i think  nobody has invested in your company to have you reinvest in real estate they have invested in your company based on  you can read the rest of the interaction first randall tells him to take a time out and then eventually he says the following the mortgage on this property is backed by a year lease by a aaa company and so that is our decision and i dont agree so best of luck to you pal bold added for emphasis this is a shareholder that is voicing a real concern randall works for the shareholders despite his large ownership stake in the business and to dismiss his concerns in this manner seems to be inappropriate note educ spent  million to purchase a acre site while owning a million site  blocks away randall says that the purchase makes sense because hilti whom educ purchased the site from is covering the mortgage via their lease payments he then goes on to say that because hilti spent  million to repair their portion of the building that this has increased the value of the property i have always hated this argument that the rents have been set so educ cannot increase the rents to reflect this new value more questionable language in the second call towards the end of the call randall seems to not to be sure how to end the call so he starts talking about an event that educ has upcoming and he says the following all right dan heather go out and sell something heather were going to have  if you want to have a little fun come to tulsa next week  women all  theyre all mine theyre coming to convention and we get to inspire them and motivate them and get them out there selling books bold added for emphasis about his consultants that are women he says they are all mine this again seems to be very questionable behavior for a ceo of a publicly traded company there is also a reference in the first conference call questioning the intelligence of his shipping employees because they are from oklahoma how many shares do randall and craig really own on page  of the most recent proxy statement we can see a rule regarding section a i have copied the relevant language for your review under section a of the securities exchange act of  our directors executive officers and any persons holding more than ten percent of our common stock are required to report their initial ownership of our common stock and any subsequent changes in that ownership to the sec and to furnish the company with a copy of each such report specific due dates for these reports have been established and we are required to disclose in this proxy statement any failure to file by these dates during and with respect to fiscal year  to our knowledge based solely on review of the copies of such reports furnished to us during and with respect to fiscal year  all section a filing requirements were satisfied i have added the bold language to comply with this rule most individuals file a form  and form  a form  is a standard initial beneficial ownership disclosure filed with the sec and a form  is used to update specific changes in ownership here is a copy of a form  filed for randall white the date of the document is  and his ownership is stated as  shares why am i discussing a document from  while this is the last form  filed for all of educ one possible reason would be that there has been no changes to the ownership necessitating a filing i could only find one filing for craig white it doesnt look like he ever filed a form  and this form  was filed on  next i went to the proxy statements where educ reports the share ownership i was to take that information for each of the years and create the following chart this is the stated ownership of both randall white and craig white randalls reported number is going down slightly and craigs has gone up but we do not have any transaction data to tell us what is happening form s are important so investors can see what the executives are doing with their stock why is this happening i havent been able to figure out why there are no form s since  there may be some exemption they are using but the ones i looked at didnt seem to apply for example the size of the transaction also the change in share ownership doesnt appear related to options being exercised or forfeited but that wasnt very clear either to be clear this could be a clerical issue an exemption i dont know about or some attempt to hide the changes in ownership the other side of the coin educational development corporation has been growing rapidly over the past two years the question then is whether this growth is good for the longterm viability of the business the first article i wrote questions the validity of that growth and this article attempted to demonstrate some of the more qualitative issues happening at the company the company is attempting to portray themselves as having normal growing pains of a large company the mantra is something like the following the purchase of a acre property and inventory purchases are causing some temporary cash flow issues randall white stated that he wants to get the company to  pretax profits he also discusses at length the issues they had with software they purchased the question for any investor is whether the issues raised are simply growing pains that can be fixed over time or are they something bigger the question for readers to decide is what narrative do you want to believe narrative a educ is undergoing a profound shift and has the ability to grow substantially in the future to be a million dollar company or narrative b the company is changing and not for the better the ceo seems to be focused on the wrong financial metrics engaging in conference calls issuing sales reports almost monthly and pumping the stock higher while ignoring the basic corporate governance issues standard at other publicly traded companies i have no position in this company long or short nor do i have any form of derivative exposure i had initially explored educ as a possible long but i concluded that it was a company i wanted nothing to do with despite my interest in childrens books arena disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other than from seeking alpha i have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article editors note this article covers one or more stocks trading
