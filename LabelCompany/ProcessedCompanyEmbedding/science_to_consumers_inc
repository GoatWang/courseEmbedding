remedy the signs of aging – soft tissue filling agents like injectable collagen fat or hyaluronic acid and botox®type treatments a nerve agent botox® is injected to relax the muscle deep beneath facial lines and wrinkles  previously wrinkles and lines on the face received injectable collagen from cows to hide depressions and visible signs of aging recently humanderived injections like plasmagel® and cosmoderm® have joined the market providing an alternative to cosmetic surgery and skin resurfacing  quite a simple procedure collagen injection involves infusing the material through insertion of a fine needle just beneath the surface of a line or wrinkle this procedure causes few side effects though some concerns exist regarding allergic reactions and possible transmissible diseases associated with the products  similar to collagen fat injections apply fat from one’s own body to disguise and rid the skin of wrinkles neither of these injections results in a permanent solution with results sometimes lasting only a few weeks often these procedures must be repeated within a year to maintain the desirable effect z hyaluronic acid injections reducing wrinkles and lines may also be achieved through injection of hyaluronic acid a natural component of connective tissues some hyaluronic acid has been extracted from rooster combs this injectable filler can be found in products like restylane® and captique® both of which have received fda approval much like collagen and fat injections hyaluronic acid wrinkle treatments are not permanent solutions the results commonly last between six and twelve months the second class of wrinklebattling injections derived from a nerve agent that paralyzes nerves leaving the underlying muscle relaxed thereby reducing the appearance of wrinkles lines and folds widely known and extremely popular botox® temporarily reduces wrinkles fdaapproved only for use in glabellar – between the eyebrows – wrinkles this cosmetic dermatology procedure has produced favorable results in many cases both between the eye brows and on other parts of the face for some people botox® carries side effects such as leaving the patient with an unnatural “stunned” look after the procedure furthermore botox® a toxin does not react well with some people the effects of the procedure are fleeting requiring patients to schedule additional treatments about every three months stop wishing those wrinkles away… try dermalastylβ™ today and get the results you want with our money back guarantee you have nothing to lose… except the wrinkles

sciencetoconsumerscom website  facebook select page natural skin care as we begin developing in the womb our bodies begin to produce elastin which will continue to develop in early childhood  following childhood our bodies produce less and less new elastin and eventually the elastin begins to break down considerably as we age over the course of a typical lifetime up to  percent of the total elastin in our bodies is lost resulting in wrinkles and sagging skin  while this occurs the body also slows the production of supporting extracellular matrix proteins like collagen laminin and keratin this insufficiency causes the skin to experience more wrinkles laugh lines smile lines crow’s feet and facial creases  another disadvantage to lowered counts of these proteins involves the skin’s damage control due to the reduced levels of collagen laminin keratin and elastin skin becomes more susceptible to damage and requires more time to heal properly  if a new source of elastin could be introduced to the skin wrinkles and signs of aging could be reversed leaving skin soft smooth and young looking thanks to dermalastylβ™’s active ingredient elastatropin™ skin can renew itself

headlines science news from research organizations product choice when are consumers most satisfied date november   source journal of consumer research inc summary consumers may be less satisfied with the choices they make if their options are presented one at a time rather than all at once according to a new study share full story consumers may be less satisfied with the choices they make if their options are presented one at a time rather than all at once according to a new study in the journal of consumer research sequentially presented choices create uncertainty consumers know that alternatives will become available in the future but not what those alternatives will be so there is always the possibility that a better option could later be available write authors cassie mogilner wharton school of the university of pennsylvania baba shiv stanford university and sheena iyengar columbia university many decisions  selecting a bar of soap at the drugstore an entrée at a restaurant or a pair of shoes from zappos  involve choosing from options presented all at once however many important decisions  choosing a job a home or even who to marry  involve options presented one at a time does the way options are presented affect consumer satisfaction in a series of experiments consumers presented with options one at a time ended up less satisfied with and ultimately less committed to their choices than those presented with their options all at once consumers presented with their options all at once tended to remain focused on the current set of options and focused on comparing them against each other whereas those presented with their options one at a time tended to imagine a better option hoping it would eventually become available this feeling of hope undermined how they later experienced their choice resulting in lower satisfaction and commitment levels the primary difference between sequentially and simultaneously presented options is the presence of alternatives consumer satisfaction with a chosen option depends less on its objective merits and more on how it compares to alternatives  real or imagined enjoying the most satisfaction from our choices might require being willing to give up the eternal quest for the best the authors conclude story source materials provided by journal of consumer research inc note content may be edited for
