hiatt at  or thiattspencerfanecom   spencer fane llp the choice of a lawyer is an important decision and should not be based solely on advertisements hiatt and co ltd a possible history of hiatt and its birmingham competitors       hiatt and co ltd a possible history of hiatt and its birmingham competitors introduction hiatt  co ltd griffin nichols t  a longmore froggatt field a time line introduction the origins of hiatt and company ltd lie in the late eighteenth century  as stated in vintage and contemporary company advertisements according to both the hiatt and the american hiattthompson web pages the company was begun by a mr hiat with one t supposedly he set up shop in  at  masshouse lane in birmingham in the year  when birmingham england was little more than a village any passerby walking down the well known thoroughfare called masshouse lane might have stopped out of curiosity to look at a new sign which had recently gone up at number  this intimated that a certain mr hiat was a maker of prisoners handcuffs felons leg irons and gang chains to the trade this quote as taken from the hiattthompson web page the quote originally comes from a newspaper article that appeared in the black county survey published in  it was part of a series of articles devoted to the histories of famous firms although the article is fascinating to read it gives no documentation for the companys earliest history the article does make reference to entry for hiat with one t in an  trade directory unfortunately this entire story seems to be mostly myth collectors have searched for and speculated about early hiatt restraints shouldnt the earliest examples be marked hiat with one t as far as i know no such cuffs have ever been found it seemed that some original research was needed i had two types of evidence to examine written records in the form of old trade directories and advertisements and actual examples of old handcuffs a close examination of their markings revealed important clues the results of this research led me to write a book on the subject entitled british handcuffs a collectors guide to vintage handcuffs the possible history that is presented here is based upon information that appears in this new book the book also includes pictures of about a hundred vintage british handcuffs taken from my collection hiatt  co ltd perhaps the best documentation of early th century birmingham are the early trade directories published by wrightson significantly there is no mention of hiatt in wrightsons triennial directory of birmingham published in  however the  directory does include a listing for thomas griffin and co horse and dog collar fetter and gate lock makers located on digbeth street in  thomas griffin hiatt appears in the wrightson directory for the first time as a manufacturer of felons irons and gate locks located on moor st in birmingham some time in the next few years hiatt moved around the corner to  masshouse lane where he is located in the next edition of the wrightsons birmingham directory as a manufacturer of felons irons gate lock handcuffs horse and dog collars the hiatt company remained at the  masshouse lane address until the premises were destroyed by the world war ii german bombing in  as mentioned above the spelling of the name hiatt with one t or two is a matter of some confusion some sources including the present day hiatt web sites claim that early cuffs were issued with only one t in the name however i have never seen a cuff marked with an original hiat mark and i am not convinced that they exist from chris gowers collection even cuffs marked with the very early moor street birm address have a hiatt with two ts logo one possible reason for the confusion is due to spelling errors in the wrightson directories the spelling is hiatt in the  and  directories of the series but in the intermediate years the name is listed as hiat with one t these misspellings may be responsible for the one t myth the directories are actually full of misspellings in one place hiatt name is listed as t g hart a clue to hiatts earliest years may be found in his full name thomas griffin hiatt there must be a relationship between hiatt and the previously mentioned thomas griffin and co on digbeth street perhaps thomas griffin was hiatts grandfather and taught hiatt the trade according to an entry in alex nichols book examples of cuffs marked hiatt and griffin exist such cuffs may predate the independent hiatt operation and represent work done by thomas griffin hiatt working with thomas griffin and co the independent hiatt company prospered by  william john hiatt was running the company and in  the dix birmingham directory contained this listing hiatt william john successor to the late thos griffin hiatt handcuff manufacr to her majestys honorable board of ordanace and original manufacturer of all kinds of police and other handcuffs police leg and travelling irons police staves sabers pistols rattles and lanterns  masshouseln h moseley rd balsallheath griffin the history of the griffin handcuffs has been rather obscure but it turns out that griffin may be one of the most important birmingham handcuff companies products are known with the griffin name only but there are also cuffs marked griffin  nichols and in addition according to the alex nichols book there are cuffs marked hiatt  griffin how are these cuffs related the story turns out to be rather fascinating griffin is certainly one of the earliest handcuffs companies in wrightsons triennial directory for  there is a listing for thomas griffin and co horse and dog collar fetter and gate lock makers on digbeth street this same directory does not have any listing for hiatt since the directory is rather thorough this suggests that perhaps the hiatt company did not exist in  three years later the  directory lists a changed company name griffin appears to have taken a partner the new company is griffin  nichols at the same address and with the same products the name griffin is misspelled in the  directory but correct in later editions the  directory also lists t g hiatt thomas griffin hiatt as an irons and gate lock manufacturer on moor street this is the earliest directory listing for hiatt the similarity of the two names cannot be a coincidence thomas griffin hiatt and thomas griffin must have been related perhaps griffin was hiatts grandfather a family relationship would certainly explain the existence of cuffs marked hiatt and griffin indeed it is possible that the supposed  beginning date for hiatt  co ltd may actually be traced through some griffin lineage after all it is significant that none of the existing literature can assign a name to the instigator of the hiatt company the hiatt web site simply refers to him a mr hiat with one t perhaps mr hiat was actually mr griffin thomas griffin with two fs hiatts grandfather or some other close relative in  griffin  nichols are listed as makers of horse and dog collars fetter and d locks handcuffs and boot tips at  digbeth street the partnership between griffin  nichols was relatively short lived and handcuffs marked griffin  nichols are rare in the  birmingham directory griffin is gone and james nichols is listed alone as a chain horse and dog collar and felons iron maker still at the digbeth street address this double change in company names over about a fifteenyear period shows that that griffin cuffs come first predating cuffs marked griffin  nichols nichols cuffs come later postdating the partnership nichols the history of nichols handcuffs is tied up with the history of griffin and hiatt sometime between  and  it appears that thomas griffin formed a partnership with james nichols the company was located in birmingham on digbeth street sometime later in the late s the griffin name was dropped and james nichols becomes the sole proprietor of the digbeth street operation i have two types of nichols handcuffs a very nice back strap darby and a couple of pairs of standard darby cuffs they carry a characteristic curved nichols trademark as shown above one of my standard darby handcuffs has the curved nichols logo and the date  this date is important because in  the t  a longmore company placed an advertisement in the birmingham corporate directory with a reference to the late james nichols the implication of the advertisement is that james nichols has just left the business likely due to his retirement or death and that t  a longmore has taken over the company however the story gets more complicated than this i also have a pair nicely plated nichols darby handcuffs that look like they were made in the late nineteenth century or even the early twentieth significantly they do not have the curved nichols trademark instead they have the nichols name printed in bold letters along with an equally large birmingham police designation so how do we interpret this information perhaps there were two nichols operations one began with griffin in the early nineteenth century and then ended with the death of james nichols the second separate operation perhaps founded by another member of the same family may have come into existence in the later nineteenth century or perhaps this odd nichols cuff is not made by nichols at all maybe it was merely owned or sold by someone named nichols more research is needed t  a longmore thomas and arthur longmore were ironwork makers through out much of the mid nineteenth century in the  corporation birmingham directory an advertisement for t  a longmore appears listing them as manufacturers of police handcuffs most interesting is a reference to the late james nichols the address in digbeth corresponds to the address listed for griffin and nichols in the early nineteenth century  this likely means that upon james nichols retirement or perhaps his death the company that began as thomas griffin and co was purchased by t  a longmore however it appears that the venture was very short lived as soon as  the longmore handcuff references are gone from birmingham directories and the longmores are listed only as iron founders and heavy steel toy manufacturers not surprisingly the t  a handcuffs appear to be very rare the lone example i have in my collection is the only one i have ever seen field field  sons was also founded in the eighteenth century but in london not birmingham in the  directory of london and westminster  borough of southwark the company was listed as field  parker located at  high holborn london according to a note from chris gower the name of the company changed to parker field  sons from   although their products were often marked just field  holborn london from  the company relocated to  lehman street and the company name changed to field  sons at this point the company seems to have gone out of business field handcuffs are relatively plentiful but most interestingly there is no real evidence that they ever manufactured cuffs all their products are very similar to hiatt products and it seems likely that field simply acted as hiatts london agent it is interesting to note a comment from houdini made in the october 6 issue of his conjurers magazine houdini herewith is presented the plug eight handcuff this is an extraordinary broad one was used in south africa during the boer war and they say the cuff is used on the kaffir diamond thieves no matter how heavy the manacle may be the locking arrangement is generally the same this cuff is made by hiatt of birmingham froggatt of boardsley and the one time handcuff maker fields strange but almost all of the english cuffs are made in birmingham or its vicinity in this quote houdini refers to fields as a former handcuff maker and implies that their cuffs came from birmingham but here is no evidence of a fields operation in birmingham hiatt most likely made cuffs of fields froggatt william wests  directory of warwickshire lists william froggatt of  court bordesley st birmingham as a manufacturer of dog and horse collars and felons iron maker later in the s froggatt moved to bartholomew st and then on to  bradford street where they remained ownership of the company stayed in the family and came eventually to williams grandson thomas froggatt who was born in 6 thomas froggatt  co became hiatts main competitor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in 7 thomas froggatt sold the company to hiatt but froggatt continued on as employee he finally retired in  at the age of  when hiatt moved to their new suburban location on baltimore road great barr thomas froggatt was said to have been a good friend of harry houdini and to have supplied houdini with many of the handcuffs and leg irons that he used in his act judged by the abundance and ease of finding froggatt cuffs today froggatt sold a lot of handcuffs in particular froggatt plug  cuffs are nearly as plentiful as are hiatt plug s froggatt must have also been a major exporter to america because froggatt cuffs turn up relatively frequently on this side of the atlantic other companies there were other birmingham handcuffs companies in addition to those discussed here thompson dowler and hudson are the most important however as far as i know they have no direct links to hiatt more details about these other companies can be found in my book time line the figure below shows an approximate time line for the various interlinked birmingham handcuff companies remember this is a possible history dont take anything you read here as fact at least not until more research has been completed a possible time line for major handcuff companies thomas griffin and co founded in late th century on digbeth street about  thomas griffin takes on james nichols as a partner forming griffin  nichols in the late s james nichols assumes ownership of the company forming james nichols  co early s t  a longmore acquires the james nichols company but the digbeth street business closes after only a few years about  thomas griffin hiatt establishes new operation first on moor street but soon moves to masshouse lane in s william john hiatt assumes ownership of hiatt  co ltd field  parker founded in london in the th century becomes hiatts london agency selling hiatt cuffs under the parker name in  the company name changes to parker field  sons in  company name changes to field  sons and goes out of business in  in s william froggatt co forms on bordesley street in the late th century thomas
