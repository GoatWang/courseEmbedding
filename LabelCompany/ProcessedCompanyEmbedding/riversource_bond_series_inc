and may  a floating rate debt instrument is a bond or loan whose interest rate floats based on a market interest rate plus a premium the floating rate assets interest rate resets periodically to incorporate changes in the market rate this compares to a fixed rate debt instrument which is an asset with a fixed interest rate whose value can fluctuate based solely on the direction of market rates through much of the year turmoil in the subprime mortgage market spilled over into other parts of the debt and credit markets declining trends in loan prices and high yield debt overall triggered an increasing numbers of sellers in a downward spiral of selling pressure the large moneycenter banks and investment banks attempted to bring to market a number of previously underwritten loan and high yield bond offerings to little avail following the april and may  rally during which the turmoil that engulfed the capital markets abated somewhat the markets turned decidedly bearish again such bearishness re surfaced as credit writeoffs at banks exceeded earlier expectations oil prices were materially higher than a year prior despite modest lateperiod declines unemployment rates escalated and the housing market continued to decline in addition problems at fannie mae and freddie mac the government seizure of indy mac and ongoing problems of the monoline insurance companies weighed on investor confidence and increased pressure on the economic system as a whole several other factors caused the high yield loan market to struggle in the last months of the annual we

the month reporting period demand remained tepid for example the market for new collateralized loan obligations clos a major source of demand in the loan market for the last several years remained largely inaccessible mutual fund demand was generally flat to down and the banks were hesitant to put their own capital at risk these weak technical factors along with increasingly disconcerting credit fundamentals continued putting pressure on high yield loan prices changes to the funds portfolio we increased the funds position in cash and cash alternatives during the annual period given heightened market volatility and our expectation that such volatility will continue over the remainder of the year higher cash balances also enabled us to take advantage of the heightened volatility by identifying and purchasing what we believed to be attractive loans and other securities on a relative value basis when opportunities presented themselves while we focused on the higher quality segments of the leveraged bank loan and high yield debt markets throughout the period we moved to purchasing a slightly higher quality mix of assets as the fiscal year progressed given our belief that the next six to  months will likely continue to present economic challenges our future strategy we currently intend to continue to maintain the funds exposure to the higher quality segments of the leveraged bank loan and high yield floating rate universe given that we expect the high yield debt market along with the broader fixed income market to be quite volatile over the remainder of the year we further intend to hold higher cash balances in the fund than we have over the past few years at the same time should opportunities present themselves we may continue to cautiously deploy some of the funds cash balances over the near term given the recent decline in high yield loan prices indeed although we believe that corporate defaults will likely increase over the coming year due to the weak economy there are still pockets of value in the leveraged bank loan universe in our view certain industries such as health care and technology for example appear to be somewhat insulated from the

b fees and other fund fees and expenses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds in addition to the ongoing expenses which the fund bears directly the funds shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests also referred to as acquired funds including affiliated and nonaffiliated pooled investment vehicles including mutual funds and exchange traded funds the funds indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the funds pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds using the expense ratio of each of the acquired funds as of the acquired funds most recent shareholder

price debt securities are generally traded in the overthecounter market and are valued at a price that reflects fair value as quoted by dealers in these securities or by an independent pricing service foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in which such securities are normally traded the procedures adopted by the board generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price quotations or valuations are not readily available price quotations or valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed unreliable or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or class of securities such as foreign securities that is not reflected in price quotations or valuations from other sources a fair value price is a good faith estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time many securities markets and exchanges outside the us close prior to the close of the new york stock exchange and therefore the closing prices for securities in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but before the close of the new york stock exchange including significant movements in the us market after foreign exchanges have closed accordingly in those situations ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial parent company of the investment manager as

of the new york stock exchange shortterm securities maturing in more than  days from the valuation date are valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest rates those maturing in  days or less are valued at amortized cost investments in loans the senior loans acquired by the fund typically take the form of a direct lending relationship with the borrower acquired

change in its management provides reason for optimism for its prospects ahead indeed based on our ongoing credit research we maintained the funds positions in each of these weak performers as we continued to like their fundamentals and were constructive on their prospects going forward the fund outpaced its lipper peer group due primarily to effective security selection and industry

changes to the funds portfolio over the course of the period as investors grew increasingly risk averse amidst a liquidity crunch recession concerns and the aftermath of turmoil in the housing subprime mortgage and credit markets we shifted to an increasingly defensive stance within the funds portfolio we upgraded the quality of the holdings overall such that the fund began the period with a yield in excess of the merrill lynch index and ended the period with a yield lower than that of the merrill lynch index we increased the funds exposure to more defensive industries such as energy exploration and production defense and regional local exchange carriers we correspondingly reduced the funds weighting to more cyclical economically sensitive areas including autos auto parts and supply and auto finance as well as paper also the funds exposure to financials relative to the merrill lynch index decreased as the financials universe of securities grew but we did not increase the funds position in this area at the end of the annual period the fund had sizable allocations compared to the merrill lynch index in energy gaming health care defense food and beverage and to a lesser extent broadcastingmedia and services the fund had more modest exposure than the merrill lynch index to the metals and mining autos and auto parts supply and finance retail financials publishing technology and paper and forest products industries at the end of july  the fund had virtually equal weighting to the merrill lynch index in the integrated telecommunications and utilities sectors our future strategy going forward we continue to believe that the key to potential outperformance will be leveraging our strength in credit research we strive to select the right bonds while maintaining a diligent review of potential credit risks at individual companies we sell bonds when we believe that risks outweigh a bonds total return potential we have a bottomup approach when selecting credits one of our competitive advantages is that our team of nine analysts performs indepth research to acquire deep knowledge and insight of the industries they cover we believe that good security selection based on quality and indepth security research will be key to performance over the near to mid term   riversource income opportunities fund   annual report

slowdown and of the credit markets troubles as oil and gas prices soared during the  months to new record levels inflationary pressures also became a growing concern especially as it may impact profit margins going forward further we anticipate that the default rate within the high yield bond market may increase somewhat in the months ahead and we remain guarded about company fundamentals valuations at the end of the annual period did not fully reflect in our view these broad concerns for the high yield bond market all told given that we believe the high yield bond market may continue to face meaningful headwinds during the second half of  taking incremental risk when valuations do not justify it does not seem prudent thus we currently intend to maintain the funds emphasis on more defensive industries with less exposure to cyclical economically sensitive sectors we further intend of course to continue to seek opportunities to capitalize on attractively valued bonds that have

other mutual funds in addition to the ongoing expenses which the fund bears directly the funds shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests also referred to as acquired funds including affiliated and nonaffiliated pooled investment vehicles including mutual funds and exchange traded funds the funds indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the

paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this

costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the

based on our view ahead our future strategy in our view overall inflation will stay elevated during the second half of  as inflationary pressures including passthrough effects from high energy and food prices feed through to core prices over the months ahead indeed positive economic growth expected over the remainder of this year combined with lingering high inflation expectations mean inflation will likely remain high well into  while recent fed commentary regarding inflation has begun to sound more hawkish the financial markets appear to have little conviction that the fed will actually address inflation with interest rate hikes anytime soon we believe core inflation is likely to increase slightly over the near term as nonenergy and food prices are forced higher which in turn will push inflation expectations higher as well we believe that it will be this threat of more widespread inflation that may force the fed to reverse direction and start raising shortterm interest rates some time late in  or early  the speed at which the fed moves to raise shortterm interest rates could determine the path of inflation from the funds perspective what may be most important is that we believe that overall inflation will remain materially above core inflation   riversource inflation protected securities fund   annual report

in which it invests also referred to as acquired funds including affiliated and nonaffiliated pooled investment vehicles including mutual funds and exchange traded funds the funds indirect expense

payments and  ongoing costs which may include management fees distribution and service b fees and other fund fees and expenses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds in addition to the ongoing expenses which the fund bears directly the funds shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests also referred to as acquired funds including affiliated and nonaffiliated pooled investment vehicles including mutual funds and exchange traded funds the funds indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the funds pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds using the expense ratio of each of the acquired funds as of the acquired funds most recent shareholder report the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the six months ended july   actual expenses the first line of the table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading titled expenses paid during the period to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these transactional costs were included your costs would have been higher   riversource limited duration bond fund   annual report pncsrth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  enlargedownload table beginning ending expenses

pricing service foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in which such securities are normally traded the procedures adopted by the board generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price quotations or valuations are not readily available price quotations or valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed unreliable or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or class of securities such as foreign securities that is not reflected in price quotations or valuations from other sources a fair value price is a good faith estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time many securities markets and exchanges outside the us close prior to the close of the new york stock

securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the board including utilizing a third party pricing service to determine these fair values these procedures take into account multiple factors including movements in the us securities markets to determine a good faith estimate that reasonably reflects the current market conditions as of the close of the new york stock exchange swap transactions are

investment review and compliance committees in determining whether to continue the ims agreement at the april   inperson board meeting independent legal counsel to the independent directors reviewed with the independent directors various factors relevant to the boards consideration of advisory agreements and the boards legal responsibilities related to such consideration following an analysis and

of a reasonably high quality particularly in light of recent market conditions based on the foregoing and based on other information received both oral and written including the information on investment performance referenced below and other considerations the board concluded that riversource investments and its affiliates were in a position to continue to provide a high quality and level of services to the fund investment performance for purposes of evaluating the nature extent and quality of services provided under the ims agreement the board carefully reviewed the investment performance of the fund in this regard the board considered i detailed reports containing data prepared by an independent organization showing for various periods the performance of the fund the performance of a benchmark index the percentage ranking of the fund among its comparison group and the net assets of the fund and ii a report detailing the funds performance over various periods including since inception recent fund inflows and outflows and a comparison of the funds net assets from december  to december  the board observed that the funds investment performance was appropriate in light of the particular management style and market conditions involved comparative fees costs of services provided and the profits realized by riversource investments and its affiliates from their relationships with the fund the board reviewed comparative fees and the costs of services to be provided under the ims agreement the board members considered detailed comparative information set forth in an annual report on fees and expenses including among other things data prepared by an independent organization showing a comparison of the funds expenses with median expenses paid by funds in its peer group as well as data showing the funds contribution to riversource investments profitability the board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should reflect a rational pricing model applied consistently across the various product lines in the funds family while assuring that the overall fees for each fund are generally in line with the pricing philosophy ie that the total expense ratio of each fund with few exceptions is at or below the median expense ratio of funds in the same comparison group the board took into account that the funds total expense ratio after considering proposed expense capswaivers was below the peer groups median expense ratio shown in the reports based on its   riversource limited duration bond fund   annual report

showing comparative profitability over the past two years the board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through the use of commission dollars paid by the funds on portfolio transactions the board noted that the fees paid by the fund should permit the investment manager to offer competitive compensation to its personnel make necessary investments in its business and earn an appropriate profit the board concluded that profitability levels were reasonable economies of scale to be realized the board also considered the economies of scale that might be realized by riversource investments as the fund grows and took note of the extent to which fund shareholders might also benefit from such growth the board considered that the ims agreement provides for lower fees as assets increase at preestablished breakpoints and concluded that the ims agreement satisfactorily provided for sharing these economies of scale based on the foregoing the board including all of the independent directors concluded that the investment management service fees were fair and reasonable in light of the extent and quality of services provided in reaching this conclusion no single factor was determinative on april   the board including all of the independent directors approved the renewal of the ims agreement proxy voting  the policy of the board is to vote the proxies of the
