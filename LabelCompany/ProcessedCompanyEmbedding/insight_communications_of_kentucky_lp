cook circuit judges sargus district judge opinion cook circuit judge  defendantappellants insight communications company lp and insight kentucky partners ii lp collectively insight appeal the district courts decision denying insight immunity from plaintiffappellee knology incs sherman act and  usc §  claims because the noerrpennington doctrine insulates insight from liability for its activities here we reverse the district courts decision i facts and procedural history  insight and knology are cable television service providers in  the city of louisville kentucky passed ordinance  granting insight a franchise to provide cable services the ordinance included a level playing field provision which states  the rights and privileges granted by this ordinance to operator are not exclusive and nothing herein is intended to or shall be construed so as to prevent the city from granting other franchises  provided however that they are neither more favorable nor less favorable than those granted to operator herein any subsequent franchise shall contain a provision suspending the effective date for sixty  days during which time after prompt written notice is given by the city to operator if operator claims to be aggrieved parties shall seek a declaration of rights in a court of competent jurisdiction during which time the effective date of the subsequent franchise shall be suspended pending a final and nonappealable decision resolving the issue  two years later louisville enacted ordinance  creating knologys franchise which provides  the franchise created by this ordinance shall become effective as to any particular franchisee sixty  days after the effective date of the board of aldermens resolution accepting that franchisees bid provided however that if insight seeks a declaration of rights  the effective date of the franchise  shall be suspended pending a final and nonappealable decision resolving the issue  as the ordinance anticipated insight then sued the city in state court seeking a declaration that the city granted knology a more favorable franchise that suit triggered the ordinance provision suspending the effective date of knologys franchise until a final nonappealable decision resolved the issue some thirteen months later the state court granted summary judgment for the city finding that the franchises were substantially similar the kentucky court of appeals affirmed and the kentucky supreme court denied discretionary review  soon after insight filed in state court knology sued insight and the city in the district court knology argued among other things that insights state suit and its invocation of the provision suspending knologys franchise violated the sherman act the cable act and the first amendment and that knology was therefore entitled to damages under the sherman act and  usc §  the district court ruling on a motion for partial summary judgment viewed insights one act — filing suit — as two acts warranting two contrary holdings insight was immune under the noerrpennington doctrine for its act of filing the state court action but not immune for its invocation of the franchise suspension provision by its act of filing the state court action the district court also ruled insight was not immune from knologys §  claims because it was a state actor when it invoked the suspension that reasoning led the court to enter summary judgment for knology on its §  first amendment claim  insight appeals the district courts decision arguing among other things that it is immune from the sherman act and §  claims under noerrpennington we agree reverse the district courts decision on that issue and remand the case for further proceedings ii noerrpennington immunity  the noerrpennington doctrine allows businesses to combine and lobby to influence the legislative executive or judicial branches of government or administrative agencies without antitrust or §  liability because the first amendments right of petition protects such activities eaton v newport bd of educ  fd   th cir the doctrine immunizes parties from liability under antitrust laws or §  for actions taken when petitioning authorities to take official action even where the petitioning activity has the intent or effect of depriving another of property interests except under very limited circumstances id  those circumstances exist where parties use the petitioning process rather than the outcome of that process as an anticompetitive weapon city of columbia v omni outdoor advertising inc  us    s ct   l ed d   such a sham situation involves a defendant whose activities are not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action at all not one who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result but does so through improper means id citations emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted  here the district court appraised insights activities — lobbying for including the suspension provisions in knologys franchise ordinance and filing its state court suit — as legitimate petitioning protected by the first amendment and therefore entitled to noerrpennington immunity but the district court went on to decide that  the suspension of knologys franchise although triggered by insights lawsuit was a product of contract not sought through litigation the stay was not subject to governmental review nor was it intended to persuade the government of anything instead it was automatic  we analyze the issue differently we see filing the lawsuit and invoking the suspension provision as a single petitioning activity protected by the first amendment and noerrpennington that this petitioning caused an anticompetitive result is irrelevant to noerrpennington analysis insight did not stay anything — only the government prevented knology from moving forward in the face of insights suit insight simply spurred the city to comply with its own ordinances by filing its complaint — action immunized by noerrpennington and the first amendment  the district court noted that the ordinance insights suit invoked was a byproduct of insights prior petitioning this however is irrelevant as the district court acknowledged the prior petitioning was protected so was insights lawsuit considered separately or together they cannot give rise to liability  we conclude therefore that insight engaged in nothing more than legitimate petitioning as a result noerrpennington bars all of knologys claims for damages against insight arising out of the stay foreclosing relief on the other issues raised on appeal iii conclusion  we reverse the district courts decision denying insight noerrpennington immunity and granting knology summary judgment on its first amendment §  claim and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion notes  the honorable edmund a sargus jr united states district judge for the southern district of ohio sitting by designation secgems

service agreement barring class action litigation against insight by its customers was enforceable the appellants complaint was accordingly dismissed because of that disposition the circuit court and the court of appeals did not address other issues including appellants challenge to the enforceability of the service agreements general arbitration clause and other specific provisions contained therein we granted discretionary review to consider appellants challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement and to the class action ban and confidentiality clauses contained therein we granted appellees crosspetition for discretionary review to enable a more complete resolution of the whole controversy including the disputed choice of law provisions of the agreement and the effect of severability of the challenged provisions from the remaining portion of the arbitration agreement for the reasons stated below we reverse the court of appeals and conclude that under the circumstances present herein the contractual ban on class action litigation is void and unenforceable we also determine as follows  the service agreements choice of law provision is not enforceable and that kentucky law rather than new york law is applicable to our review  that the service agreements general arbitration provision is not unconscionable that it comports with kentuckys public policy preference favoring arbitration that it is severable from the provisions banning class actions and imposing confidentiality and is therefore enforceable and  that the provision imposing a confidentiality requirement upon the litigants to arbitration proceedings is void i factual and procedural background appellants are kentucky residents who entered into the service agreement with
