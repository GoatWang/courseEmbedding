call over to yishay our cfo for his detailed report on our financial results yishay please yishay curelaru thank you shlomi and good morning everyone before the market opened today we issued the results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended december   in a press release a copy of the release is available in the investor relations section of our web site as we reported in the press release our total revenues for the fourth quarter increased  to  million from  million in q  this increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of readers to the us market if we exclude the amounts received for intellectual property rights in q  the increase quarteroverquarter is more than  for the full year total revenues increased  to  million from  million last year the increase was primarily due to an increase in sales of indiscernible to the us market and an increase in sale of our otimetry solution in the european market as a reminder the past revenues and other results reported today reflect the shifting of results from our parking business to discontinued operations following the completion of the sales of a business in the third quarter of  now breaking down q revenues by source and their percent of total revenues retail and mass transit ticketing revenues was  million or  petroleum revenues was  million or  and medismart and access control product revenue was  or  now breaking down our revenues for the full year of  by source and their percent of total revenue retail and mass transit ticketing revenues was  million or  petroleum revenues was  million or  and medismart and access control product revenues was  million or  gross profit for the fourth quarter of  decreased  to  million or  of revenues compared to  million or  of revenues in q  the decrease in gross margin was mainly attributed to yearend inventory adjustment and a change in our revenue mix for the full year gross profit increased  to  million or  of revenue compared to  million or  of revenue in  turning to our expenses for the fourth quarter of  operating expenses decreased  to  million from  million in the same year ago period for the full year operating expenses decreased  million or  to  million from  million last year the significant improvement was primarily due to the cost reduction measure we implemented in  operating expenses for  marked the lowest level for oti in more than three years our net loss from continued operation for the fullyear totaled  million or  per share this was a significant improvement from a net loss from continued operation of  million or  per share in  turning to our nongaap results weve adjusted ebitda from continued operation a nongaap metric as we believe it provides a clear indication of our operating results in  our adjusted ebitda loss improved our threeyear record of  from a loss of  million in  the improvement came from both higher revenues and a significant reduction in our operating expenses please reference to the earning release for further details about this nongaap metric including reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to our comparable gaap results now turning to the balance sheet cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment at yearend totaled  million which was up  from the end of prior year this completes my financial summary for more detailed analysis of our financial results please refer to our form q which we plan to file by march   i would like to turn the call back to shlomi for additional comments on out operational progress and outlook for  shlomi shlomi cohen thank you yishay as you heard from yishay we were able to maintain our positive momentum and we are pleased to report a fifth consecutive quarter of improvement in our results and more importantly we were able to deliver significant improvement in our annual results the yearoveryear improvements are very meaningful to us as they demonstrate how far we have came  come over the last  months in our work to put oti on a path towards consistent profitability growth as a result of our significant efforts to reduce cost optimize our operations focus our product offering and increase our sales we are able to deliver over  improvement in adjusted ebitda flows from  in which new breakeven adjusted ebtida for the full year we have also made significant improvement on the product sale and operational front possibly the most notable and promising progress came in japan following on our receipt of felica certification for our rebuild we received in late  a letter of intent for major japanese retailer to purchase  otimetry system consisting of our felica certified reader and our gobox multiservice telemetry gateway during the coming three years this letter of intent was followed by a formal purchase order in early  we see this as a great progress into a very promising market as a result of our continuing work to develop sales pipeline in the japanese market together with our partner billing systems we believe that this market will deliver additional opportunities in the months and year to come  was also very productive on the product front as we got off to a strong start in transitioning from being a simple hardware supplier to a full solution provider offering vending operators and other partners a onestopshop for their payment solutions and services in europe we have seen growth in the deployment of our otimetry solutions which allow us to generate recurring revenue in addition to the revenue associated with the product sales turning to north america i will first address the topic of the companys litigation with us safety and masterwork as we reported earlier this month usa gives five lawsuits against oti claiming that the oti readers that were sold by oti to usa it is subcontractor masterwork electronics were not confirming because they did not include the valueadded services or vas feature of apple pay we dont believe this claim has any merit vas was never promised to us safety while it was also not specified in the scope of the purchase order issuing by masterwork not only we will be aggressive in our defense of these lawsuits but we have also initiated a lawsuit of our own against masterwork to protect our rights the payments from masterwork for a product that we have believed in this situation puts greater emphasis and importance on expanding and diversifying our customer base both globally in places such as japan and europe and in north america where we have successfully positioned oti and our products for entry into the growing kiosk or selfcheckout market through our work with north american channel partners earlier this year we received several purchase orders for the supply of thousands of advanced selfcheckout payment system to leading us based kiosk operators and fast food chain we believe that these first purchase orders are only the beginning of otis entry into this key vertical and we believe that during the coming year we will see continued acceleration and sales to this market we have also made progress in our wearable business following the launch in may  of pay capsule flex payment enabler inserts and our pay enabled platform in november we displayed a smart payment ring utilizing our technology this demonstrates our ability to turn any product and fashion garment into a payment device with our wearable cashless payments technology successfully demonstrated we have increased our business development and sales efforts for our pay enabled products and we believe that these efforts will yield results and with that we are now ready to open the floor for your questions operator please provide appropriate instructions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from josh elving with feltl and company you may begin josh elving hi good morning guys shlomi cohen good morning josh elving i had a couple of questions one i was trying to get  i know you yishay commented on the gross margin briefly and i think i might have missed some of that i just was trying to get little bit of more color there as to what was the main impact on the gross margin in the quarter and maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations for gross margin going forward yishay curelaru okay so first as i mentioned in my presentation the first issue is regarding revenue mix ph change if you remember last quarter of  we reported the intellectual property rights betterment ph to reach… josh elving right yishay curelaru it wasnt better in this quarter end and other revenue mix products so  the next thing is yearend inventory adjustment including inventory accounts and also that inventory adjustment as we did this yearend just to clear off the table as it fits for a new year josh elving so if i assume about a  margin on license and transaction fees or close to that that kind of back into gross margin on hardware of around kind of low  and so really that difference or that number being closer to  in the fourth quarter just had more to do with inventory adjustments is that correct yishay curelaru as you know we dont give any guidance as to our gross margin but we can assume an improved gross margin as we advance in  josh elving okay but the fourth quarter gross margin on equipment was lower because of the inventory adjustment yishay curelaru thats correct shlomi cohen thats correct josh elving okay and did that have anything to do with the litigation with usat shlomi cohen nothing yishay curelaru no no none at all josh elving okay and looking at the balance sheet the receivables picking up does that have to deal with that lawsuit currently shlomi cohen that was has to deal with our sales over the years and mostly of our sales in the fourth quarter which in part relates to the lawsuit josh elving okay thats helpful thank you can you  so i know you talk a lot about your optimism for japan can you talk about you know when we  like what your expectations are for over the course of this year when you might expect to see additional orders you know obviously the opportunity is massive but what could that opportunity be for you is it potentially hundreds of thousands of connections over the next couple of years can you maybe talk about the size of your opportunity and in addition when we might see our next few orders shlomi cohen okay josh as you know constantly we are not giving any guidance regarding the future but i will say the following were now  and since beginning of last year we are working intensively in the japanese markets and fortunately the first fuel came and in parallel to this account we are working on several different major accounts in the japanese market and as i mentioned during  i mentioned earlier we are expecting to accelerate the business in the japanese markets this is the only thing that i can say at the moment and i believe that you know in the coming quarter we will see results josh elving in the coming quarter did you say shlomi cohen in the coming quarters josh elving in the coming quarters okay and by the way congratulations i do think that was a significant first purchase order out of japan i have more questions i will get back in queue thank you operator thank you our next question is from brian kinstlinger with maxim group please proceed brian kinstlinger hi great congratulations shlomi you have really turned this company around in the last  months now this restructuring is complete can you talk about capital allocation your different businesses and any changes you are making to drive accelerated top line growth and where do you see most of the growth coming over the next three to five years of your two businesses shlomi cohen okay basically since last year we are actually working on several verticals and new markets i mentioned already japan but its not only japan its also europe also there we are doing a significant progress and also there by the way most of our revenue is going to be based  and total be based on recurring revenue and definitely on providing solutions but on top of that we definitely can mention the selfcheckout system market that early this year we have been able to get significant purchase order for one of the fast food chain in north america and top of that we are expecting also to see a significant growth also on the atm vertical for the banks so acn selfcheckout system in japan and europe they are actually the main growth engine that we are having in the coming years on top of the fact that we are very strong on the vending market as well im not mentioning at this point of time the iot because the iot is a gamechanger for us and we are still working in order to develop few major accounts that we having since we developed the flex that this is actually the core technology this is a total gamechanger and im very positive regarding this brian kinstlinger great and then are you going to provide any detail on timing of the ramp of those  systems order in japan i mean i was confused maybe you had mentioned it when  how thats going to ramp over time shlomi cohen we do specific accounts at the moment at least we are speaking on contract for fields and this is what the beginning for  and the idea is to implement  systems every year for the next two years thats the basic contract that we are having with these retailers and this is only one account brian kinstlinger and whats the  have you provided or can you provide the monthly subscription per machine shlomi cohen not at this point of time but hopefully later this year we will be able to speak about it as well brian kinstlinger but should we assume with  orders there should be a modest discount or is pricing not discounted on large orders shlomi cohen no no basically the business model although there but we are setting a full solution plus were going to generate recurring revenue from each one of those systems that are going to be installed brian kinstlinger great thank you so much for your time shlomi cohen thank you operator thank you our next question comes from edward schwartz with schwartz investments please proceed edward schwartz good morning shlomi shlomi cohen good morning edward schwartz in q your net loss  of q  your net loss was like  i had it in front of me it was very small and it seemed to have increased in q can you talk about that any reason why yishay curelaru yes ed this is yishay edward schwartz maybe if i misread it its fine but i dont think i did yishay curelaru no you read it just fine as i mentioned before our gross revenue went a little bit down because of yearend adjustment and revenue mix as for the operating expenses we are talking about an interest regarding yearend bonuses both in israel and all other subsidiaries and thats the reason edward schwartz okay and this next question is directed to shlomi it appears to me you have a factory relationship when a customer or supplier go to a litigation how are you going or can you give some color forward as how you are going to replace that business in north america shlomi cohen look i think that i mentioned before that we didnt wait to face such kind of event in order to balance major accounts with other verticals and other markets we are working on that if i remember it correctly since beginning of last year and basically with such kind of event needless to say that we are having much more freedom to approach directly a major accounts that in the past we were reluctant doing that so i believe by the way that for the longterm the benefits that we will generate from such events will be very positive for the company and without getting into details at this point of time edward schwartz okay and the sale to masterworks electronics was about  million is that going to affect your cash position or ability to make deals in the near future because thats started up in receivables or inventory or whatever shlomi cohen i will the  careful and i will say that at this point of time we are not going to place any impact on that lets wait a little bit im sure that we will be able to present our products edward schwartz okay thank you i appreciate it shlomi cohen you are welcome thanks operator thank you our next question comes from mike latimore with northland capital management please go ahead nick goldman yes hi guys this is nick goldman on for mike thanks for taking my questions shlomi cohen sure nick goldman just looking to next year do you guys expect revenue to grow and i guess specifically do you see license and transaction growing next year shlomi cohen absolutely the answer is positive yes this is part of our new sales strategy and needless to say that we are doing a significant effort in order to increase recurring revenue as part of a strategy that we established beginning of last year nick goldman got it great okay and then just kind of going off that in terms of the revenue mix what percent of revenue might license and transaction be this year shlomi cohen okay basically today when you are looking lets say im actually looking on that and im looking on the entire revenue that we are having we are having today more than  of our total revenue that is actually coming from recurring revenue and we believe that we are going to accelerate it during  nick goldman got it got it okay and then just final one from me… shlomi cohen by the way maybe one additional comment this is by the way a significant change that we were making during  and we are going to accelerate it during  and i believe that because of that its going to impact our gross margin for the longterm nick goldman got it got it okay and then what kind of volumes do you see from the large food chain customer over the next year shlomi cohen as i mentioned before we are not giving guidance regarding the specific accounts but i will say that this is only the beginning with this specific food chain with  lets say with the plans we are having at the moment the idea is to accelerate the number of systems that we are going to implement in the network nick goldman got it okay thanks guys shlomi cohen welcome operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from mike vermut with newland capital please proceed mike vermut hi gentlemen i just want to say youve done a fantastic job turning us around so far shlomi cohen thanks mike vermut it seems like we are adding inflection in the business and the business model is changing right to become a recurring revenue model as appose to a one that consisted the hardware stuff it was much better for us over the long run is that the case in japan europe and now what you are rolling out here in the us are you trying to change that model here with the fastfood with the banks with all of that so that the majority of these implementations are going to be recurring in nature shlomi cohen yes in europe its definitely since they want because dont forget that in europe we started almost from scratch and today we are starting to see a significant install base over that that based on a recurring revenue japan its actually the same and the idea over there that we are lets say minutes from doing that after the first implementation to generate a recurring revenue and the same thing by the way is taken mainly in the self checkout system we can see one  by the way one additional market that we didnt mention but this has begun to be very important for us and this is the australian market the total there its also that we built from scratch the sales strategy and in australia im more than happy to say that today we are generating on top of the solution sales that we are doing over there also are recurring revenue mike vermut excellent now also i know japan there is a deadline out there and there are some significant players with s of s of units installed already are we in discussions with these players you know these are  there are some operators there that operate four five  units are we in discussions with these now currently because that now it seems like the time where the decisions are going to have to be made over the next year shlomi cohen we were speaking not only with them we are speaking also with few other giants in this market yes mike vermut excellent excellent and then moving on to iot can you just give us some indication of what it is that we are you know what we are working on what  i see there is a lot of advertisements now coming about exactly what we are doing with google apple in clothing in devices where we stand on that and where we are going to play in the ecosystem here shlomi cohen yes first of all if you remember in the beginning of december  we actually presented in your cover payments rate and we got an excellent feedback from many potential accounts and since then we are walking closely with those potential in order to make it real and in order to see our results during  based on the core technology that we are having over there and since last year we are also walking with few potential accounts how to implement the flex into their products and i will say that almost from every quarter we can see a progress in the iot activities that we are having what you see likely from levis and google is still not payment definitely it can be a potential for us in order to implement the payment element inside the levis jacket and the same with others that are doing a other implementation in iot they can be a really good candidate for us but i believe by the way that during the coming quarters we will see additional progress in our iot as well mike vermut thanks can we assume that you have approached them to become part of that unit shlomi cohen i cannot comment on that mike vermut okay excellent all right well great progress guys its a relief to see the track that we are on here it seems like there is an inflection in the business going on shlomi cohen i appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from josh elving with feltl and company please proceed josh elving hi so a couple of followups one i just  i dont know if you commented on this i may have missed it but just  the opportunities in europe i mean obviously you have done a great job of signing additional distribution partners and i know that were actively selling into the european market but it seems as if the size of our business in europe is still you know relatively immaterial especially in context with the size of the initial purchase order you have out of japan i was just wondering if you could maybe talk about you know the size of our endtoend solutions or connections in europe and then perhaps along those lines you know maybe talk a little bit  i guess this is a separate question but maybe talk about the potential for the mix of recurring revenue for the company as a whole over time shlomi cohen okay so basically what we are doing in europe and today also in australia and also in japan is that we are actually generating endtoend solution for the vending operator for the selfcheckout system and the solution that we are having is actually based on the region for one end we are having a machinetomachine device that we are installing inside the kiosk or inside the vending machine and on top of that we are giving full software package developed by oti on top of the entire solution that generated in oti we are giving also the services of the payment processor in the bank the part that were raising in the european region is critical and aid both actually located in uk and they are actually giving us excellent coverage for the entire european region and when we are approaching actually those potential accounts such as vending operator and checkout system operators we are actually a onestopshop for the entire payment needs that they are raising today in the european market thats exactly what we are doing and following that we are able to generate recurring revenue on top of the fact that we are selling in full price the full solution that i mentioned before josh elving okay so maybe to be a little bit more specific with that question can you tell me the number of connections you have in the european market today shlomi cohen you know we are not giving guidance josh elving in my guidance just what you have currently have shlomi cohen its accelerating on a quarterly basis this is one thing that i can mention its accelerating on a quarterly basis josh elving okay with regards to the purchase order out of japan i remember the letter of intent clearly stated that the expectation was to deliver those  units over a threeyear period and then i thought pretty clearly the actual purchase order suggest that those  readers would be or systems would be delivered in  and then hearing your comments on this call suggested it is three years so i was wondering if you could provide little bit more clarity as to you know if the expectation is for the… shlomi cohen from the beginning we mentioned the fact that this loi for  systems is going to be delivered during  months and fortunately we got the first part of this field beginning of this year we are going to deliver it quite soon and as i mentioned before the contract is indiscernible and we are expecting to have also the same size of field in  and  josh elving so to be clear so the expectation is… shlomi cohen go ahead… josh elving so the expectation is to deliver  units in each of   and  or the expectation is to deliver  in  but has the recurring component over the… shlomi cohen no no no as we mentioned in the beginning its size are bit more than  systems for the next  months josh elving okay on the petroleum business in previous quarters you have talked about you know very optimistically about that business and for the last couple of  on the quarters weve been running right around a million million one in revenue talking about this being a healthy doubledigit revenue growing business so at what point in time does that kind of start to show that revenue growth because i think we are down yearoveryear in  from a revenue perspective shlomi cohen yes i think that one thing that i miss to mention is the fact that the same efforts and restructuring that we were doing in the payment part of oti group we were doing the same thing in the last six months of  in petrosmart and this is actually quite soon going to present a significant change in our results later on this year and one of the changes or one of the biggest changes that we were doing in petrosmart it was again touching the sale strategy over there and im more than proud to say that in the beginning of this year we got our to say a significant purchase order for one of the biggest oil company worldwide that is also based on our recurring revenue meaning that we are actually going to be  oti will be compensated as part of the business model over the per gallon and this is a significant change to the previous years its exact time but we are in the right direction josh elving okay and then i guess i just had one last comment and i appreciate all your help with my question if you could have the quarterly results more than  minutes before the conference call starts in a future that will be extremely helpful thanks guys thats it from me shlomi cohen okay thats the question operator thank you our next question comes from kevin dede with rodman you may begin kevin dede thanks shlomi and apologies for the naive pay but could you help me understand how the wearables and iot solution business model works and where we would see the revenue fallout shlomi cohen yes one of the things that we were doing in order to be more focused in the iot business first of all i would say that iot its impossible that everyone is actually using but if you dig in a little bit and you will fight to evaluate and how many iot companies are actually dealing with the payment i believe that you will not find too much because this market on top of the fact that its heavy regulated its also a little bit complicated for implementation we decided to focus on few vertical inside iot payment and this is actually the fashion food and health curve and automotive those are the main ones there are few others that we can touch but at this point of time we decided to focus on those vertical in each one of them the implementation is a little bit different and im not sure in this discussion we are going to cover with it but basically with the way that we are implementing the iot element and echo system that we are having around it we are  we can show to our potential account how we are going to accelerate gross margin and how we are going to accelerate also revenue i will be more than happy by the way when we will meet next time to speak with you in detail about it kevin dede okay thats fair shlomi i appreciate it is it  do you think its fair to assume we could see that iotwearable payment solution contribute to revenue this year shlomi cohen i will try to be very careful regarding that and try to answer this question next time kevin dede okay thats fair too given what you see on the four main drivers this year at what point and at what level i mean i guess this assumes a certain basis of operating cost too but im just wondering where you think that breakeven point is in revenue shlomi cohen you will speak about that the fact that we are still not profitable i believe kevin dede correct correct yes and plus the fact that you are optimistic regarding the four drivers that you see contributing to revenues this year shlomi cohen okay as i mentioned by the way before when i was actually presenting the results of  i mentioned also the fact that we strongly believe that during  we will present a positive adjusted ebitda and i believe that we are not far away from that and thats the reason that we are totally positive regarding that kevin dede okay so from an operating cost perspective are you expecting those costs to remain flat i mean i know that you saw reduction in rd cost and given the way that you streamline the business from  to  im just wondering what happens now especially given that you will have to make some capital allocations to meet expectations yishay curelaru kevin this is yishay we are doing our best to maintain and enhance our operating expenses but if you look at the previous quarter and if you look to the future into  we intend to stay and also try to reduce our operating expenses kevin dede okay so your hope is that you can still drive revenue and monitor expenses so that they are down in  versus  yishay curelaru thats correct kevin dede okay thank you very much gentlemen i look forward to seeing you at some point soon shlomi shlomi cohen thank you operator our next question comes from edward schwartz of schwartz investments please proceed edward schwartz yes hi shlomi just a followup question to joshs on fuel during recent visit to one of them like local wholesale clubs i noticed i can use nfc at the gas pump could you give some color as to what you are doing in that area in the north america shlomi cohen yes basically if you will see and you visit our website you will see that oti with a existing product line that we are having we are actually certified by mastercard visa american express discover apply pay and google pay and basically any reader installed in any place including the gas station and you can pay with your mobile phone based on apple pay or any other mobile application that supported without windows so from this point of view the platform is actually opened to those payment methods edward schwartz thats correct but what im asking is what is your marketing effort into that market  into the gas pump market shlomi cohen walking with implementing our technology in the fueling business this is something that we were doing so far outside of the state one of our plans by the way during  is to start the active in the north american market and i believe that during the coming quarters we will be able to speak about it a little bit with more details and then to expose the entire market regarding our efforts in this direction edward schwartz okay thank you very much and good luck shlomi cohen thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mike vermut with newland capital you may begin mike vermut hi guys a couple of quick followups here it seems to be here in the us market weve supplied the hardware and everyone else has reaped the benefit all right theyve got the recurring revenue theyve gotten the margin and weve been the small part of it and really havent reaped the rewards of whats going on in the market can you just give us a sense as to your vision and how our model is going to change in the us market we are seeing all the fast food restaurants with the kiosks and food stores and the gas stations across the board everything is exploding right now and how we are going to become a larger player in that with the recurring revenue and whats going to change here because it seems to me we have to move away from this being the hardware supplier to our current customers and how we become a larger part of that shlomi cohen okay look when you are actually going to a greenfield and for us europe last year was a greenfield i dont want to say that its easy but relatively its easy to start and to implement unused strategy and thats exactly what we were doing in europe and also in australia and also in japan by  from day one selling our solution and on top of it we generated revenue us market was a little bit different i dont have to tell you you know that we were being active over there before my time and to change this approach its a little bit more challenging but we are doing it and this is a good news because i think that the beginning of this year we gave you a very strong example that we are going in to this direction especially when we are actually approaching a new vertical such as the selfcheckout system and for the long run the answer is positive yes we are going to change the strategy and we are going to generate recurring revenue from the business on top of the fact that we are going to provide more and more solution and we will be less and less box mobile ph in this market so i am saying again it takes time but yes we are into this direction where our intention is not being a box mobile in this respect mike vermut excellent excellent and then i assume eventually we are going to hear who the customers are here in the us that we are talking to  i assume that would help all of us get a grasp as to how large this is shlomi cohen needless to say that i will be more than happy to tell you that but you know sometimes i am having difficulties from the other side and i respect it but on my interest to expose such big name in the us market mike vermut excellent excellent shlomi cohen needless to say that its going to help us a lot mike vermut excellent okay and then last question here it seems from what you have said on the iot side in the nottoodistant future we should be hearing a lot more as to the developments that we are having shlomi cohen yes as i mentioned before im very really positive regarding the iot we are doing significant effort into this market and yes the idea is eventually to start generate business out of this significant activities that we are delivering mike vermut excellent okay all right
