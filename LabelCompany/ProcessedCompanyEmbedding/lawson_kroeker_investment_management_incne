value in design our midwestern location sets us apart from the emotions and shortterm views of wall street this physical and psychological distance allows us to patiently and thoroughly inspect and select each investment as if we were going to buy the entire company our goal is to maximize longterm total return we also understand that prudent investors want to minimize risk and protect their assets what this means is that we adhere to specific investment criteria when we invest we don’t just review stocks we evaluate businesses philosophy patience is a key element of our philosophy various research studies have shown that the average investor significantly underperforms the overall market because they let their emotions get in the way of rational decision making they chase the latest fads with the typical result being that they miss the upswing and their gains are substantially less than what they would have been if they had just stayed the course while our style may lag the market in periods of “irrational exuberance” we try to provide an extra measure of protection during bear markets we hope to gain your trust so that you remain patient and confident even during difficult times our investment style is often described as contrarian because it is a patient disciplined longterm approach that does not focus on the stock market and its emotional roller coaster ride wall street’s shortterm views do not sway our main street longterm goals we believe that following the crowd is not a sound plan for achieving financial success strategy we conduct extensive independent research we thoroughly analyze every aspect of the company its industry and competition tax efficiency – our average stock holding period of four to five years helps to reduce capital gains investment criteria in order to achieve our investors’ longterm goals at the center of our research is a precise process we follow consistently – a repeatable pattern that guides us as we invest for lasting value when we seek consistent high quality company stocks we look for good businesses that we understand have a competitive advantage and possess high profit margins companies that have little or no debt free cash flow and deploy capital wisely firms with superior management teams leaders who are honest ethical energetic and have a strong track record of increasing the value of their organizations businesses we can buy at a discount to our estimate of value – what is known as margin of safety sell discipline we sell a company’s stock when the valuation is so high that the expected return falls below alternatives the valuation is well above longterm historical average multiples the economics of the business are deteriorating the investment is a mistake  home  about us  services

us our team our approach services news contact us mutual fund site funds site redirect close you are now being redirected away from the lawson kroeker’s site to the funds site click here to proceed philosophy investment goals  objectives three basic concepts of investor utility—introduced by the mathematician bernoulli in  —are still the basis of most methodologies of money management the first concept is that investors prefer to earn more return on their investments rather than less the second is that investors prefer less risk to more risk although they may have difficulty describing exactly what risk is the third is that investors exhibit decreasing marginal utility of wealth that is if someone is wealthy enough to own four houses gaining the wealth to buy house number five is less important than gaining the wealth to buy the first house continue reading the nexus of an investment plan that meets an investor’s objectives usually centers around risk your acceptance of risk revolves around how well you sleep at night if daily or monthly changes in the value of your portfolio keep you awake your asset allocation will be different from the investor who checks his portfolio value annually one’s ability to accept risk also centers on the goals you hope to achieve with your portfolio and the length of time you have to keep your money invested investing for the short term normally leads you to think safety first but if you are investing for an event in the distant future a greater acceptance of risk creeps into your outlook the ultimate goal of most investors is not merely to accumulate wealth but to accumulate sufficient wealth for future consumption if consumption needs are modest consumption is deferred to future generations or bequests to charitable organizations family circumstances and lifestyles evolve over time the resulting changes require adjustments between returns obtained and risks taken investing too much or too little in stocks may severely impact your ability to meet your objectives we feel it is important to try to come to terms with your situation and goals there are no easy answers but time spent on this issue will probably do more good than time spent trying to figure out if tech stocks are about to catch fire again   asset allocation  diversification as a general rule investors have three objectives when investing in securities these objectives are stability of principal current income and growth  unfortunately there is no single security which satisfies all of these objectives  satisfaction of the three objectives requires the utilization of three types of securities or asset classes cash equivalents bonds and stocks continue reading the portion of an investment portfolio which satisfies the stability of principal criterion consists of cash money market funds and highquality shortterm one to two year maturities bonds while cash equivalents offer relative price stability and income the income generated from these securities can vary greatly as shortterm interest rates change as the key attribute of bonds is income generation they are used to satisfy that objective said income may provide for living expenses or assist in the portfolio’s growth through reinvestment although bond prices fluctuate the swings are usually less dramatic than those of stock prices and bond prices sometimes rise when stocks fall because bonds and stocks do not always move in sync and bonds generally fluctuate less than stocks bonds can smooth out the returns of a stock portfolio importantly the income and relative stability of bonds may help investors to endure—both emotionally and financially—the inevitable stressful stock market downturns thus bonds do more than satisfy the portfolio’s income objective while stocks provide a modest contribution to a portfolio’s income objective their utilization in a portfolio is primarily for growth stock values fluctuate with the growth and decline of the economy the success or failure of the particular business represented and changes in investor psychology however reflecting the growth in the us economy their longterm trend has been upward providing investors with growth and inflation protection with the intent of reducing risk diversification within each asset class is also important  the bonds should be of varying maturities and represent a variety of industries the stock portion of the portfolio should be diversified not by following a mechanical formula but by analytical selection of those companies and industries most likely to prosper not only does proper diversification reduce risk it also increases the probability through the law of large numbers of better returns in any portfolio all stocks do not rise or fall equally in a given period returns are often concentrated in a few issues which significantly outperform the rest of the portfolio since the winners are not known in advance a reasonably diversified portfolio is more likely to have these winners than a portfolio concentrated in a few stocks diversification is best achieved as a byproduct of developing a wide variety of ideas and expressing those ideas via securities in a portfolio viewed in this way the adequacy of the diversification is dependent upon the breadth of knowledge and experience of the portfolio manager in other words experience counts maintaining a balanced portfolio of stocks bonds and cash equivalents is a sensible way to moderate the various risks in the securities markets  stocks make good sense for maximum longterm return and optimum protection against inflation bonds depending on their quality and maturity characteristics offer varying degrees of income and principal stability and cash reserves provide ready liquidity and the peace of mind of complete principal stability today’s volatile conditions clearly amplify the merits of a welldiversified investment portfolio  market timing diversification “it’s time in the market not timing the market that makes for successful investing” –thomas w phelps  to  in the stock market  individuals who build substantial estates through their financial investments tend to be those who “buy right and sit tight” buying right simply means purchasing stocks with favorable longterm fundamentals at attractive prices sitting tight suggests focusing on the longterm fundamentals of a company as opposed to responding to the latest news developments and rumors continue reading most portfolios are traded excessively in large part this situation stems from an emphasis on shortterm performance everywhere one looks an emphasis on shortterm results is encouraged the major financial publications remind us quarterly which mutual funds are doing well and which are doing poorly the wall street journal pits the picks of professional money managers against stocks selected by throwing a dart results are measured over a sixmonth period seldom are we reminded of the virtues of patience experience has taught us that we cannot pick stocks that will rise this quarter and fall next quarter and we have yet to meet anyone who consistently does yet many investors even professional money managers who believe they are longterm investors find it difficult to be patient they start with sound research and careful thought that identifies attractive companies in promising industries then perhaps because they are bombarded with too much “news” they slip into trading stocks and believing they can play the quarter by quarter game the whole process is analogous to predicting the winner of the next point in a tennis match vs predicting the winner of the match armed with the knowledge of the records of the opponents it is much easier to forecast the winner of the match than to forecast the winner of the next point so it is with investing advocating a buy and hold approach is intended to counter unproductive activity trading and is not a recommendation to put stocks away and forget them judicious pruning of a portfolio is warranted but the focus should be to identify what might be more permanent deterioration as opposed to that of a more temporary nature jumping from one stock to the next in an attempt to be in the right place at the right time results in much “shooting where the rabbit was” successful investing is rarely a matter of shortterm timing it is a matter of consistency and patience retirement saving “ left to earn interest at  a year will grow to  quadrillion in  years but the first hundred years are the hardest” – sidney homer there is a serious flaw in today’s workplace retirement system  too many working americans save too little with the risk that many will struggle financially in retirement forty or fifty years ago many workers joined companies that offered pension or profitsharing plans with forty to fortyfive years of employment the accumulated pension or profit sharing plus social security provided for a comfortable retirement today’s worker is unlikely to find an employersponsored pension or profitsharing plan instead at best a k plan is offered to accumulate assets in a k the employee must contribute ie reduce take home pay—and many either contribute very little or nothing at all the responsibility of providing for retirement has shifted from the employer to the employee continue reading it is important that employees get an early start saving for retirement  today the typical working life is from age twentytwo to sixtytwo—or forty years—with approximately twenty years in retirement or a  ratio of working to nonworking years it is a little scary to think that every two years of work must finance one year of retirement such a demanding task was not always so in the original state sponsored retirement pension program instituted by chancellor otto von bismark for germany in  the retirement age was seventy adult life expectancy was about seventytwo work on average began at age sixteen so that gave fiftyfour working years to finance two years of retirement then consider america in  at that point in our country’s history work started on average at age twenty and retirement averaged age sixtyseven with life expectancy of seventysix for about nine years of retirement during that period an employee had five years of work to prepare for each year of retirement getting back to the present we thought it would be helpful to give you an idea of the required savings rate needed over forty years of work to finance twenty years of retirement of course the outcome depends on the assumptions you use in an article in the september   barron’s alex j pollock made the calculation assuming one would need  of the final working year’s salary during retirement some would say this percentage should be  or  that labor productivity and wages would grow at a reasonable  annual rate during the working career that the savings would be in a taxdeferred account and that we could expect returns during the accumulation and consumption periods of – using those assumptions it would take a savings rate of  of pretax income during the working years to fund the retirement years while the  savings rate includes the employee’s contribution to social security and any contribution toward a retirement plan made by an employer the additional amount a worker must save to get to the  level is quite substantial as noted by sidney homer the power of compounding is unbelievably strong today’s young workers need to take advantage of that phenomenon and start saving early and aggressively to assure a comfortable retirement contrary opinion approach “consensus is the security blanket of the insecure” –pierre rinfret economist an important aspect of our investment approach is that of contrary opinion james l fraser founder of fraser management defines a contrarian as one who “  is early though he is not a forecaster and rather works toward thoughtout conclusions we have to think through a given problem before we gain a fresh and different approach to a solution” he further states “the object of contrary thinking is to challenge generally accepted viewpoints on the prevailing trends in politics socioeconomics business and the stock market” continue reading essentially the theory of contrary investing is to avoid that which is popular or to avoid the crowd the power of the crowd and the influence of the crowd on one’s emotions can be a dangerous element in investing as crowd behavior leads to extremes following the crowd can be rewarding for a time however the crowd or majority will be wrong at turning points when it matters the most as hopes and fears often run ahead of reality contrary thinking is one of the best ways to stay aloof from the psychology of the crowd the classic extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds by charles mackay originally published in  reviews a broad range of scams manias and the tulipomania of th century holland history is replete with examples of rational individuals succumbing to the irrationality of the crowd as mackay points out “men it has been said think in herds it will be seen that they go mad in herds while they only recover their senses slowly and one by one” it is fascinating to be reminded of how little human nature has changed and how the pattern of events repeats itself over and over the objects of speculation change but greed and fear are always there one key to success in securities investments especially stocks is to be where others want to be later studies by avner arbel and steven carvell at cornell university indicate neglect is the key characteristic in identifying securities likely to outperform they defined neglected stocks as those generally ignored by analysts and institutional investors this is true contrarian investing fraser supports this view when he states “it continues to be stocks that have lower expectations that will prove rewarding in the market place” it is far easier to explain the contrarian approach than it is to apply it consistently the difficulty is that contrary thinking goes against human nature it is only natural to feel more comfortable with your position if it is reinforced by others yet to succeed one must at critical times do the opposite of what seems to be the sensible thing that everyone else is doing contrary investing is not infallible but one’s chances for success are greatly enhanced by doing what seems to be contrary take comfort in knowing investment basics does investing seem mysterious and complicated to you sometimes it seems better to avoid saving for your future rather than put yourself in an uncomfortable situation this section provides some basics that will help you better understand the investment world — knowledge is power although there are countless investment products we stick to a proven strategy of buying stock in undervalued companies that demonstrate promising longterm growth potential we find that investors appreciate our investment style because it is a philosophy that everyone can easily understand value investing value investing is an investment system that comes from concepts that ben graham  david dodd taught at columbia business school beginning in  later they refined their teachings and published them in their  book security analysis in general value investing involves some form of fundamental analysis and buying securities at apparent bargain prices this discount of the market price to the economic value also intrinsic value or true business worth is what benjamin graham called the “margin of safety” fundamental analysis we looks at a stock purchase as if we were going to buy the entire company we believe that following a consistent process is vital before buying stock shares when we look for outstanding companies they must fit all four of these criteria good businesses that we understand have a competitive advantage and possess high profit margins   companies that have little or no debt and significant free cash flow and deploy capital wisely   enterprises with superior management teams leaders who are honest ethical energetic and have a strong track record of increasing the economic value of their organizations   businesses we can buy at a discount to our estimate of economic value – this is our margin of
