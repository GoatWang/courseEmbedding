newsletters hedge fund share loading the player what is a hedge fund hedge funds are alternative investments using pooled funds that employ numerous different strategies to earn active return or alpha for their investors hedge funds may be aggressively managed or make use of derivatives and leverage in both domestic and international markets with the goal of generating high returns either in an absolute sense or over a specified market benchmark it is important to note that hedge funds are generally only accessible to accredited investors as they require less sec regulations than other funds one aspect that has set the hedge fund industry apart is the fact that hedge funds face less regulation than mutual funds and other investment vehicles breaking down hedge fund each hedge fund is constructed to take advantage of certain identifiable market opportunities hedge funds use different investment strategies and thus are often classified according to investment style there is substantial diversity in risk attributes and investments among styles legally hedge funds are most often set up as private investment limited partnerships that are open to a limited number of accredited investors and require a large initial minimum investment investments in hedge funds are illiquid as they often require investors keep their money in the fund for at least one year a time known as the lockup period withdrawals may also only happen at certain intervals such as quarterly or biannually the history of the hedge fund  former writer and sociologist alfred winslow jones’s company aw jones  co launched the first hedge fund in  it was while writing an article about current investment trends for fortune in  that jones was inspired to try his hand at managing money he raised  including  out of his own pocket and set forth to try to minimize the risk in holding longterm stock positions by short selling other stocks this investing innovation is now referred to as the classic longshort equities model jones also employed leverage to enhance returns in  jones altered the structure of his investment vehicle converting it from a general partnership to a limited partnership and adding a  incentive fee as compensation for the managing partner as the first money manager to combine short selling the use of leverage shared risk through a partnership with other investors and a compensation system based on investment performance jones earned his place in investing history as the father of the hedge fund hedge funds went on to dramatically outperform most mutual funds in the s and gained further popularity when a  article in fortune highlighted an obscure investment that outperformed every mutual fund on the market by doubledigit figures over the past year and by high doubledigits over the last five years however as hedge fund trends evolved in an effort to maximize returns many funds turned away from jones strategy which focused on stock picking coupled with hedging and chose instead to engage in riskier strategies based on longterm leverage these tactics led to heavy losses in  followed by a number of hedge fund closures during the bear market of  the industry was relatively quiet for more than two decades until a  article in institutional investor touted the doubledigit performance of julian robertsons tiger fund with a highflying hedge fund once again capturing the publics attention with its stellar performance investors flocked to an industry that now offered thousands of funds and an everincreasing array of exotic strategies including currency trading and derivatives such as futures and options highprofile money managers deserted the traditional mutual fund industry in droves in the early s seeking fame and fortune as hedge fund managers unfortunately history repeated itself in the late s and into the early s as a number of highprofile hedge funds including robertsons failed in spectacular fashion since that era the hedge fund industry has grown substantially today the hedge fund industry is massive—total assets under management in the industry is valued at more than  trillion according to the  preqin global hedge fund report  the number of operating hedge funds has grown as well there were around  hedge funds in  that number increased to over  by  however in  the number of hedge funds is currently on a decline again according to data from hedge fund research below is a description of the characteristics common to most contemporary hedge funds  key characteristics of hedge funds   theyre only open to accredited or qualified investors  hedge funds are only allowed to take money from qualified investors—individuals with an annual income that exceeds  for the past two years or a net worth exceeding  million excluding their primary residence as such the securities and exchange commission deems qualified investors suitable enough to handle the potential risks that come from a wider investment mandate   they offer wider investment latitude than other funds a hedge funds investment universe is only limited by its mandate a hedge fund can basically invest in anything—land real estate stocks derivatives and currencies mutual funds by contrast have to basically stick to stocks or bonds and are usually longonly  they often employ leverage hedge funds will often use borrowed money to amplify their returns as we saw during the financial crisis of  leverage can also wipe out hedge funds  fee structure instead of charging an expense ratio only hedge funds charge both an expense ratio and a performance fee this fee structure is known as two and twenty—a  asset management fee and then a  cut of any gains generated there are more specific characteristics that define a hedge fund but basically because they are private investment vehicles that only allow wealthy individuals to invest hedge funds can pretty much do what they want as long as they disclose the strategy upfront to investors this wide latitude may sound very risky and at times it can be some of the most spectacular financial blowups have involved hedge funds that said this flexibility afforded to hedge funds has led to some of the most talented money managers producing some amazing longterm returns the first hedge fund was established in the late s as a longshort hedged equity vehicle more recently institutional investors – corporate and public pension funds endowments and trusts and bank trust departments—have included hedge funds as one segment of a welldiversified portfolio it is important to note that hedging is actually the practice of attempting to reduce risk but the goal of most hedge funds is to maximize return on investment the name is mostly historical as the first hedge funds tried to hedge against the downside risk of a bear market by shorting the market mutual funds generally dont enter into short positions as one of their primary goals nowadays hedge funds use dozens of different strategies so it isnt accurate to say that hedge funds just hedge risk in fact because hedge fund managers make speculative investments these funds can carry more risk than the overall market below are some of the risks of hedge funds    concentrated investment strategy exposes hedge funds to potentially huge losses    hedge funds typically require investors to lock up money for a period of years    use of leverage or borrowed money can turn what would have been a minor loss into a significant loss hedge fund strategies there are numerous strategies that managers employ but below is a general overview of common strategies equity market neutral these funds attempt to identify overvalued and undervalued equity securities while neutralizing the portfolio’s exposure to market risk by combining long and short positions portfolios are typically structured to be market industry sector and dollar neutral with a portfolio beta around zero this is accomplished by holding long and short equity positions with roughly equal exposure to the related market or sector factors because this style seeks an absolute return the benchmark is typically the riskfree rate  convertible arbitrage these strategies attempt to exploit mispricings in corporate convertible securities such as convertible bonds warrants and convertible preferred stock managers in this category buy or sell these securities and then hedge part or all of the associated risks the simplest example is buying convertible bonds and hedging the equity component of the bonds’ risk by shorting the associated stock in addition to collecting the coupon on the underlying convertible bond convertible arbitrage strategies can make money if the expected volatility of the underlying asset increases due to the embedded option or if the price of the underlying asset increases rapidly depending on the hedge strategy the strategy will also make money if the credit quality of the issuer improves fixedincome arbitrage these funds attempt to identify overvalued and undervalued fixedincome securities bonds primarily on the basis of expectations of changes in the term structure or the credit quality of various related issues or market sectors fixedincome portfolios are generally neutralized against directional market movements because the portfolios combine long and short positions therefore the portfolio duration is close to zero distressed securities portfolios of distressed securities are invested in both the debt and equity of companies that are in or near bankruptcy most investors are not prepared for the legal difficulties and negotiations with creditors and other claimants that are common with distressed companies traditional investors prefer to transfer those risks to others when a company is in danger of default furthermore many investors are prevented from holding securities that are in default or at risk of default because of the relative illiquidity of distressed debt and equity short sales are difficult so most funds are long merger arbitrage merger arbitrage also called “deal arbitrage” seeks to capture the price spread between current market prices of corporate securities and their value upon successful completion of a takeover merger spinoff or similar transaction involving more than one company in merger arbitrage the opportunity typically involves buying the stock of a target company after a merger announcement and shorting an appropriate amount of the acquiring company’s stock hedged equity hedged equity strategies attempt to identify overvalued and undervalued equity securities portfolios are typically not structured to be market industry sector and dollar neutral and they may be highly concentrated for example the value of short positions may be only a fraction of the value of long positions and the portfolio may have a net long exposure to the equity market hedged equity is the largest of the various hedge fund strategies in terms of assets under management it is also known as the longshort equity strategy global macro global macro strategies primarily attempt to take advantage of systematic moves in major financial and nonfinancial markets through trading in currencies futures and option contracts although they may also take major positions in traditional equity and bond markets for the most part they differ from traditional hedge fund strategies in that they concentrate on major market trends rather than on individual security opportunities many global macro managers use derivatives such as futures and options in their strategies managed futures are sometimes classified under global macro as a result emerging markets these funds focus on the emerging and less mature markets because short selling is not permitted in most emerging markets and because futures and options may not available these funds tend to be long fund of funds a fund of funds fof is a fund that invests in a number of underlying hedge funds a typical fof invests in  hedge funds and some fofs are even more diversified although fof investors can achieve diversification among hedge fund managers and strategies they have to pay two layers of fees one to the hedge fund manager and the other to the manager of the fof fof are typically more accessible to individual investors and are more liquid  hedge fund manager pay structure  hedge fund managers are notorious for their typical  and  pay structure whereby the fund manager to receive  of assets and  of profits each year its the  that gets the criticism and its not difficult to see why even if the hedge fund manager loses money he still gets  of assets for example a manager overseeing a  billion fund could pocket  million a year in compensation without lifting a finger  that said there are mechanisms put in place to help protect those who invest in hedge funds often times fee limitations such as highwater marks are employed to prevent portfolio managers from getting paid on the same returns twice fee caps may also be in place to prevent managers from taking on excess risk how to pick a hedge fund  with so many hedge funds in the investment universe it is important that investors know what they are looking for in order to streamline the due diligence process and make timely and appropriate decisions  when looking for a highquality hedge fund it is important for an investor to identify the metrics that are important to them and the results required for each these guidelines can be based on absolute values such as returns that exceed  per year over the previous five years or they can be relative such as the top five highestperforming funds in a particular category absolute performance guidelines the first guideline an investor should set when selecting a fund is the annualized rate of return lets say that we want to find funds with a fiveyear annualized return that exceeds the return on the citigroup world government bond index wgbi by  this filter would eliminate all funds that underperform the index over long time periods and it could be adjusted based on the performance of the index over time  this guideline will also reveal funds with much higher expected returns such as global macro funds longbiased longshort funds and several others but if these arent the types of funds the investor is looking for then they must also establish a guideline for standard deviation once again we will use the wgbi to calculate the standard deviation for the index over the previous five years lets assume we add  to this result and establish that value as the guideline for standard deviation funds with a standard deviation greater than the guideline can also be eliminated from further consideration unfortunately high returns do not necessarily help to identify an attractive fund in some cases a hedge fund may have employed a strategy that was in favor which drove performance to be higher than normal for its category therefore once certain funds have been identified as highreturn performers it is important to identify the funds strategy and compare its returns to other funds in the same category to do this an investor can establish guidelines by first generating a peer analysis of similar funds for example one might establish the th percentile as the guideline for filtering funds  now an investor has two guidelines that all funds need to meet for further consideration however applying these two guidelines still leaves too many funds to evaluate in a reasonable amount of time additional guidelines need to be established but the additional guidelines will not necessarily apply across the remaining universe of funds for example the guidelines for a merger arbitrage fund will differ from those for a longshort marketneutral fund relative performance guidelines to facilitate the investors search for highquality funds that not only meet the initial return and risk guidelines but also meet strategyspecific guidelines the next step is to establish a set of relative guidelines relative performance metrics should always be based on specific categories or strategies for example it would not be fair to compare a leveraged global macro fund with a marketneutral longshort equity fund to establish guidelines for a specific strategy an investor can use an analytical software package such as morningstar to first identify a universe of funds using similar strategies then a peer analysis will reveal many statistics broken down into quartiles or deciles for that universe the threshold for each guideline may be the result for each metric that meets or exceeds the th percentile an investor can loosen the guidelines by using the th percentile or tighten the guideline by using the th percentile using the th percentile across all the metrics usually filters out all but a few hedge funds for additional consideration in addition establishing the guidelines this way allows for flexibility to adjust the guidelines as the economic environment may impact the absolute returns for some strategies here is a sound list of primary metrics to use for setting guidelines fiveyear annualized returns standard deviation rolling standard deviation months to recoverymaximum drawdown downside deviation these guidelines will help eliminate many of the funds in the universe and identify a workable number of funds for further analysis an investor may also want to consider other guidelines that can either further reduce the number of funds to analyze or to identify funds that meet additional criteria that may be relevant to the investor some examples of other guidelines include fund sizefirm size the guideline for size may be a minimum or maximum depending on the investors preference for example institutional investors often invest such large amounts that a fund or firm must have a minimum size to accommodate a large investment for other investors a fund that is too big may face future challenges using the same strategy to match past successes such might be the case for hedge funds that invest in the smallcap equity space  track record if an investor wants a fund to have a minimum track record of  or  months this guideline will eliminate any new funds however sometimes a fund manager will leave to start their own fund and although the fund is new the managers performance can be tracked for a much longer time period  minimum investment this criterion is very important for smaller investors as many funds have minimums that can make it difficult to diversify properly the funds minimum investment can also give an indication of the types of investors in the fund larger minimums may indicate a higher proportion of institutional investors while low minimums may indicate of a larger number of individual investors redemption terms these terms have implications for liquidity and become very important when an overall portfolio is highly illiquid longer lockup periods are more difficult to incorporate into a portfolio and redemption periods longer than a month can present some challenges during the portfoliomanagement process a guideline may be implemented to eliminate funds that have lockups when a portfolio is already illiquid while this guideline may be relaxed when a portfolio has adequate liquidity how are hedge fund profits taxed when a domestic us hedge fund returns profits to its investors the money is subject to capital gains tax the shortterm capital gains rate applies to profits on investments held for less than one year and it is the same as the investors tax rate on ordinary income for investments held for more than one year the rate is not more than  for most taxpayers but it can go as high as  in high tax brackets this tax applies to both us and foreign investors an offshore hedge fund is established outside of the united states usually in a lowtax or taxfree country it accepts investments from foreign investors and taxexempt us entities these investors do not incur any us tax liability on the distributed profits ways hedge funds avoid paying taxes many hedge funds are structured to take advantage of carried interest under this structure a fund is treated as a partnership the founders and fund managers are the general partners while the investors are the limited partners the founders also own the management company that runs the hedge fund the managers earn the  performance fee of the carried interest as the general partner of the fund hedge fund managers are compensated with this carried interest their income from the fund is taxed as a return on investments as opposed to a salary or compensation for services rendered the incentive fee is taxed at the longterm capital gains rate of  as opposed to ordinary income tax rates where the top rate is  this represents significant tax savings for hedge fund managers this business arrangement has its critics who say that the structure is a loophole that allows hedge funds to avoid paying taxes the carried interest rule has not yet been overturned despite multiple attempts in congress it became a topical issue during the  primary election many prominent hedge funds use reinsurance businesses in bermuda as another way to reduce their tax liabilities bermuda does not charge a corporate income tax so hedge funds set up their own reinsurance companies in bermuda the hedge funds then send money to the reinsurance companies in bermuda these reinsurers in turn invest those funds back into the hedge funds any profits from the hedge funds go to the reinsurers in bermuda where they owe no corporate income tax the profits from the hedge fund investments grow without any tax liability taxes are only owed once the investors sell their stakes in the reinsurers the business in bermuda must be an insurance business any other type of business would likely incur penalties from the us internal revenue service irs for passive foreign investment companies the irs defines insurance as an active business to qualify as an active business the reinsurance company cannot have a pool of capital that is much larger than what it needs to back the insurance that it sells it is unclear what this standard is as it has not yet been defined by the irs hedge fund controversies  a number of hedge funds have been implicated in insider trading scandals since  the two most highprofile insider trading cases involve the galleon group managed by raj rajaratnam and sac capital managed by steven cohen the galleon group managed over  billion at its peak before being forced to close in  the firm was founded in  by raj rajaratnam in  federal prosecutors charged rajaratnam with multiple counts of fraud and insider trading he was convicted on  charges in  and began serving an year sentence many galleon group employees were also convicted in the scandal rajaratnam was caught obtaining insider information from rajat gupta a board member of goldman sachs before the news was made public gupta allegedly passed on information that warren buffett was making an investment in goldman sachs in september  at the height of the financial crisis rajaratnam was able to buy substantial amounts of goldman sachs stock and make a hefty profit on those shares in one day rajaratnam was also convicted on other insider trading charges throughout his tenure as a fund manager he cultivated a group of industry insiders to gain access to material information steven cohen and his hedge fund sac capital were also implicated in a messy insider trading scandal sac capital managed around  billion at its peak the sec raided offices of four investment companies run by former sac capital traders in  over the next few years the sec filed a number of criminal charges against former sac capital traders mathew martoma a former sac capital portfolio manager was convicted on insider trading charges that allegedly led to over  million in profits for sac he obtained insider information on fda clinical drug trials on an alzheimer’s drug that sac capital then traded steven cohen individually never faced criminal charges rather the sec filed a civil suit against sac capital for failing to properly supervise its traders the department of justice filed a criminal indictment against the hedge fund for securities fraud and wire fraud sac capital agreed to settle all claims against it by pleading guilty and paying a  billion fine the hedge fund further agreed to stop managing outside money however a settlement in january  overturned cohen’s lifetime ban from managing money and will let him manage money in two years subject to review by an independent consultant and sec exams new regulations for hedge funds hedge funds are so big and powerful that the sec is starting to pay closer attention particularly because breaches such as insider trading and fraud seem to be occurring much more frequently however a recent act has actually loosened the way that hedge funds can market their vehicles to investors  in march  the jumpstart our business startups act jobs act was signed into law the basic premise of the jobs act was to encourage funding of small businesses in the us by easing securities regulation the jobs act also had a major impact on hedge funds in september  the ban on hedge fund advertising was lifted in a to vote the sec approved a motion to allow hedge funds and other firms that create private offerings to advertise to whomever they want but they still can only accept investments from accredited investors hedge funds are often key suppliers of capital to startups and small businesses because of their wide investment latitude giving hedge funds the opportunity to solicit capital would in effect help the growth of small businesses by increasing the pool of available investment capital hedge fund advertising entails offering the funds investment products to accredited investors or financial intermediaries through print television and the internet a hedge fund that wants to solicit advertise to investors must file a “form d” with the sec at least  days before it starts advertising because hedge fund advertising was strictly prohibited prior to lifting this ban the sec is very interested in how advertising is being used by private issuers so it has made changes to form d filings funds that make public solicitations will also need to file an amended form d within  days of the offering’s termination failure to follow these rules will likely result in a ban from creating additional securities for a year or more         trading center two and twenty blow up short hedge selling hedge

the third in a series of foley advisers about fatca the new us tax regime designed to combat offshore tax evasion by us taxpayers that will go into effect on january    our prior installments described fatca compliance for  us standalone funds and us feeder funds with only us investors part one click here and  us master funds with offshore feeder funds that are treated as corporations for us tax purposes part two click here  this part three focuses on preliminary fatca compliance for offshore master funds with onshore and offshore feeder funds – for example a cayman islands master treated as a partnership for us tax purposes with a delaware limited partnership feeder and a cayman islands feeder treated as a corporation for us tax purposes  the following discussion assumes that the offshore master fund is required to be fatcacompliant offshore funds  master and feeder the specific fatca compliance obligations of an offshore master fund or an offshore feeder fund will depend on the country in which such offshore fund is organized  the united states currently is in the process of concluding fatcarelated intergovernmental agreements “igas” with countries throughout the world based on two model agreements  the model  iga and the model  iga   an offshore fund organized in a model  jurisdiction will refer to the applicable model  iga and local law to determine its fatca compliance requirements  in contrast an offshore fund organized in either a model  jurisdiction or in a country that is not a party to an iga generally will refer to the us fatca regulations to determine its fatca compliance requirements regardless of whether your offshore fund is located in a country that is a model  model  or noniga jurisdiction you must take the following preliminary steps registration  you must register each offshore fund entity with the irs using the online “fatca registration portal” which will be accessible through the irs’s website no later than july     upon successful registration each of the offshore funds will receive a global intermediary identification number “giin” a special taxpayer identification number for fatca purposes and its name and giin will be included in an online list of fatcacompliant entities that will be first published in december  and then will be updated on a monthly basis fatca agreement  as part of the registration process an offshore fund that is organized in a model  or noniga jurisdiction will be required to enter into an agreement with the irs pursuant to which the offshore fund will agree to undertake certain due diligence obligations with respect to its current and future owners submit information returns to the irs with respect to certain us owners and conduct withholding on payments or allocations of certain ussource income to nonus entity owners that fail to comply with fatca irs form w  the offshore master fund must maintain a valid irs form w for its us feeder fund in its files irs form w  once the offshore funds have registered and obtained their giins each offshore fund should immediately complete a new “postfatca” irs form w the offshore master fund should maintain a valid “postfatca” irs form w for the offshore feeder fund in its files and verify on an ongoing basis that the offshore feeder fund and its giin continue to be included in the published irs list of   fatcacompliant entities in addition the offshore master fund should prepare its own valid “postfatca” irs form w and furnish it to entities in which it invests if required if the offshore master fund invests in another entity that is a “withholding agent” for fatca purposes such as an unrelated us investment fund or an unrelated nonus investment fund that is subject to fatca in a fundoffunds structure and such investment was or is made prior to january   you generally will have a grace period until june   to provide the offshore master fund’s “postfatca” irs form w and giin to the withholding agent in order to avoid the fatca withholding tax   in contrast if the offshore master fund makes an initial investment in an entity that is a withholding agent on or after january   you generally will have  days from the date on which the offshore master fund acquires the interest to provide this information to the withholding agent regardless of the applicable deadlines you should begin the fatca registration process  with respect to existing offshore funds as soon as possible after registration opens in july  and  with respect to offshore funds formed after the fatca registration portal becomes accessible as soon as possible thereafter onshore feeder fund in order to ensure that the onshore feeder fund is fatcacompliant you should follow the procedures in part one click here if the onshore feeder fund has only us investors or the procedures in part two click here if the onshore feeder fund has us and nonus investors  in either case the onshore feeder fund should provide the offshore master fund with a valid irs form w if it has not done so already the foregoing discussion is limited to the preliminary fatca compliance obligations of offshore masterfeeder structures  offshore entities that must be fatcacompliant will have additional ongoing obligations to maintain their compliance with fatca  you should review your fund and subscription documents to ensure that they contain appropriate provisions to enable the offshore master fund and its onshore and offshore feeder funds to fulfill their additional fatca compliance obligations including provisions requiring investors to provide any needed information under fatca fatca compliance is casespecific  if you would like more detailed information regarding fatca please contact kip cawley rick schaulyoder nicola lemay or your foley hoag lawyer  not all foreign entities must be fatcacompliant many factors including source and type of income affiliations with other foreign entities and business relationships may affect the determination of whether a foreign entity must be fatcacompliant an analysis of these factors and a discussion of this determination are outside the scope of this foley adviser↩  most countries in which offshore funds typically are organized including the cayman islands and the british virgin islands have executed or currently are negotiating model  igas↩  we will publish another foley adviser regarding access to the portal after the irs makes the information available↩  even if an offshore fund completes the registration process in july  the irs will not begin issuing giins until october ↩  an offshore fund organized in a model  jurisdiction will not be required to enter into a fatca agreement but will have similar responsibilities under the applicable model  iga and local law including the obligation to collect information about its owners and furnish information to its local taxing authority with respect to certain us owners which information then will be shared with the irs↩  existing versions of irs form w are not sufficient the irs intends to issue new versions of form w specifically for fatca purposes we will publish another foley adviser with links to these “postfatca” forms w after the irs makes the final versions of such forms available↩  the applicable grace period for offshore funds with pre investments in nonus entities organized in iga jurisdictions may vary depending upon the terms of the applicable iga↩  these deadlines also apply to offshore feeder funds and are based on the date an offshore feeder fund acquires its interest in an offshore master fund↩ written by christopher r k cawley nicola lemay view or download pdf related industries investment management » related practices fund formation » general business counseling »
