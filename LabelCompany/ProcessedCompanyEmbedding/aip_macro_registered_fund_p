such investment fund  nav  as such value is supplied by or on behalf of the investment fund s investment manager from time to time usually monthly values received from or on behalf of the investment funds respective investment managers are typically estimates only subject to subsequent revision by such investment managers such values are generally net of management fees and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the investment funds managers or general partners pursuant to the investment funds operating agreements the investment funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies established by each investment fund as described in each of their financial statements or offering memoranda the fund s investments in investment funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering memoranda as appropriate while the fund does not currently intend to invest in investment funds which maintain side pockets as defined below as of the time of the fund s investment by a manner which would expose the fund to such side pockets one or more investment funds subsequently may establish such side pockets and therefore expose the fund and thus its shareholders to such side pockets side pockets are subfunds within the investment funds that have restricted liquidity potentially extending over a much longer period than the typical liquidity an investment in the investment funds may provide should the fund seek to liquidate its investment in an investment fund that maintains these side pockets the fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay which could be considerable in such cases until the fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the investment fund the fair value of its investment could fluctuate based on adjustments to the value of the side pocket as determined by the investment fund s investment manager as of december   none of the fund s net assets were invested in side pockets maintained by the investment funds the adviser has designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to investment funds and their investment managers which assist the adviser in assessing the quality of information provided by or on behalf of each investment fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further investigation is necessary such investigation as applicable may or may not require the adviser to forego its normal reliance on the value supplied by or on behalf of such investment fund and to determine independently the fair value of the fund s interest in such investment fund consistent with the fund s fair valuation procedures  notes to financial statements continued  significant accounting policies continued portfolio valuation continued where no value is readily available from an investment fund or where a value supplied by an investment fund is deemed by the adviser not to be indicative of its fair value the adviser will determine the fair value of the investment fund in order to determine the fair value of these investment funds the adviser has established the fund of

investment manager and available relevant information as it considers material after consideration of the portfolio management team s recommendation the valuation committee will determine in good faith the fair value of the investment fund the valuation committee shall meet at least annually to analyze changes in fair value measurements because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation the fair

to sell an investment or pay to transfer a liability in a timely transaction with an independent buyer in the principal market or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for the investment or liability the fund uses a threetier hierarchy to distinguish between a inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the fund s investments the inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below level  quoted prices in active markets for identical investments level  other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar investments or shortterm investments that are valued at amortized cost level  significant unobservable inputs including the fund s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments the inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments the units of account that are valued by the fund are its interests in the investment funds or other financial instruments and not the underlying holdings of such investment funds or other financial instruments thus the inputs used by the fund to value its investments in each of the investment funds or other financial instruments may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such investment funds or other financial instruments the fund s policy is to recognize transfers between levels   or  and transfers
