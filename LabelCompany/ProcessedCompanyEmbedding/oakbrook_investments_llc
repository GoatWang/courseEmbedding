llc all rights reserved disclosures investment strategies   infooakbrookinvestcom  home about us strategies research and commentary contact us strategies oakbrooks different way of thinking is reflected in the investment strategies we offer our three principals believe that high quality independent research leads to superior investment results sound economic theory forms the basis for oakbrooks original and highly respected investment research our research leads to investment strategies that are as compelling as they are different from more conventional approaches for example our select equity strategy focuses on companies that possess a trait economists refer to as market power oakbrooks family of quantitative strategies makes use of auction theory for stock selection this economicsbased perspective has also led to exciting new insights into styles of investment management by applying proprietary research we have built an innovative family of style indices that offer a highly efficient means of gaining exposure to a variety of investment styles our small cap strategy utilizes these style indices to identify stocks likely to underperform in the long run and eliminate them from client portfolios in a style neutral fashion quantitative management our quantitative strategies bring together the best aspects of both passive and active management any active management style will go through periods of substantial over and under performance relative to a benchmark while passive management merely seeks to replicate benchmark performance these strategies combine the best of each to add value over and above index year after year oakbrook’s quantitative stock based approach is distinctive repeatable and can enhance the performance of virtually any index dispensing with the common tactics of factor analysis and optimization it bases its success on two components a twofactor stock selection model with a firm underpinning in economic theory and a unique set of risk controls oakbrooks quantitative strategies can be targeted to expected annual excess returns ranging from  to  gross of fees with information ratios near  several large and mid capitalization us benchmarks are offered including sp  russell  russell  growth and value and russell mid cap  portfolio managers peter jankovskis phd cfa janna sampson cfa giri cherukuri cfa paula mikrut cfa benefits reduce risk of underperforming greater consistency of excess return lower fees than pure active management further reduction of portfolio risk excess return typically has low correlation with that of other active equity managers performance most recent quarterly product profile list and description of oakbrook investments composites disclosures market neutral oakbrook offers a longshort market neutral strategy that employs the same quantitative stock selection model as used in oakbrook’s family of enhanced index strategies the model is applied to a universe of  domestic large cap stocks a rigorous portfolio construction process is then implemented to create a portfolio that is dollar neutral style neutral and volatility neutral the portfolio’s value added is a function of the return spread between the long and short positions the goal of market neutral is to outperform month tbills by  over time after fees with return volatility comparable to bonds the returns of the strategy are expected to have little or no correlation with those of other asset classes portfolio managers peter jankovskis phd cfa janna sampson cfa giri cherukuri cfa paula mikrut cfa benefits attractive absolute returns low volatility limited downside risk low correlation with returns of other asset classes performance please contact oakbrook investments directly for additional information on market neutral disclosures small cap oakbrooks small cap strategy utilizes a proprietary style classification system to identify a group of overpriced small cap stocks and exclude them from client portfolios in a style neutral fashion benchmark relative gains from excluding the overpriced stocks are augmented by decisions to overweight or underweight stocks on the basis of return momentum the strategy is expected to outperform the sp  index by an average of  to  per year gross of fees with an information ratio greater than  portfolio managers peter jankovskis phd cfa janna sampson cfa giri cherukuri cfa paula mikrut cfa benefits welldiversified portfolio typically holding  to  stocks lower fees than pure active management disclosures select equity oakbrook’s select equity strategy is built upon an economic concept called “market power” companies with market power possess both dominant market share and barriers to entry entry barriers can take several forms including patents brand recognition economies of scale and several others companies with market power effectively enjoy a shield from competition which protects market share longerterm profitability and promotes creation of longterm shareholder value shares of these leading companies are purchased when oakbrook considers them undervalued by the market the strategy’s goal is to outperform the sp  by  over the investment cycle while not exposing investors to additional risk due to the conservative defensive nature of stocks held in the portfolio select equity offers its best relative performance during stable declining or highly volatile markets while typically lagging somewhat during rising markets portfolio managers janna sampson cfa peter jankovskis phd cfa giri cherukuri cfa paula mikrut cfa benefits long term history of delivering high alpha attractive down market performance excellent long term performance gross of fees focused on long run profitability rather that short term earnings lowers portfolio turnover improves performance over the market cycle low correlation to aggressive growth value and private equity combines best attributes of growth and value styles complements other equity strategies well provides smoothing effect to total plan performance performance most recent quarterly product profile list and description of oakbrook investments composites disclosures style indices everyone has experienced the cyclicality of growth and value managers but why is it that not all value managers for example move in lockstep with one another through years of research we have identified another factor a third dimension to style that is so powerful it deserves to be a style classification in its own right this factor is the stability of a stock’s past returns relative to other stocks and is the basis for our stable and variable style groups both these groups offer a sharp distinction in performance categorizing stocks on the basis of the stability of returns represents a powerful extension of the conventional value and growth framework enhancing the ability of our indices to distinguish growth from value stocks failure to consider this factor can lead to underperformance we have found that most equity managers are either stable value or variable growth thereby leaving two significant style gaps – stable growth and variable value – that can be filled with our indices to improve the diversification of overall equity portfolios four improved style groups – pure and powerful most of today’s leading style indices are indeed watered down holding too many stocks that don’t capture the true characteristics of the style they are meant to represent and when indices become diluted they fail to demonstrate the return pattern of their style as they move through the business cycle oakbrook’s style indices instead only include those stocks in each group that demonstrate the strongest characteristics the benefit is that each of our four style indices has pure style properties whether used as complements or enhancements to other styles these indices are powerful tools stable growth and variable value styles are under represented in most institutional portfolios and the indices can be used to gain exposure to these styles or stable growth and stable value can be combined to form a stable equity index one which offers very attractive
