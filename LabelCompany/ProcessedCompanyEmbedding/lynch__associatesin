a half to get this done i had been trying to accomplish this for two or three years and was never successful as a result we got an additional  million in variable insurance capacity to hedge our growing marktomarket equity and fixed income liabilities lynch  associates took over the companys tracking system and optimized it so the entire deferred compensation program can be viewed across multiple operating companies and tracked against the coli program to assess the effectiveness of the hedging strategy were delighted with that they saved us  million in hard costs by reducing expenditures they restructured an existing set of policies and saved us  million present value dollars in premiums they took all of our insurance policies ran them in their system and found  million in death benefits that had not been obtained by our existing third party administrators all of that was just in  the company official believes that lynch differs from its competitors in the personal and customized service it offers this is a small group that is highly specialized i am able to put that team in front of our most senior executives to explain these programs and they always acquit themselves well we have the same team dealing with us now that we have had for almost  years they absolutely understand what we want and are willing to customize the information in any way that we request we have always been very well served by lynch and i am delighted with the relationship corporateowned life insurance policies go on for decades so this relationship will go on through the remainder of my career but eventually i am going to retire and someone else is going to have to take this over they are going to need lynchutility testimoniala large east coast utility engaged lynch and associates for its executive compensation plan and was pleased with the work so when the need arose to restructure a nuclear decommissioning trust they approached lynch to bid on the project it involved a complicated move of the utility from one service agent to another as well as bringing the trust from a general account program to a separate account program to give the utility more protection it was a large trust more than  million with lots of moving parts lynch won the business and immediately went to work sorting out all the component parts which turned out to be a messy proposition one of the first things discovered was that some previous insurance carriers handling the ndt accounts had not done their work properly creating tax liability problems for the utility the utilitys treasurer noted how lynch  associates not only discovered the problem but moved quickly to resolve it we had to clean that up with the regulators they discovered the problem took the initiative to correct it and got us through it kudos to them they handled things admirably they stay on top of things in addition to this complication many of the policies under the previous program were not operating at maximum efficiency and effectiveness and lynch worked diligently to close out these old policies and transfer cash to a new program for active employees all the while ensuring that in moving from a general account to a separate account program for active employees there was enough money left in the old program to protect the companys retirees that is not our area of expertise it is very technical and that is why we are very dependent on lynch  associates we are very satisfied with them because they have a lot of expertise the firm provides tremendous customer service they are always available when you need them and are very open to discussions they are friendly engaging people and you like working with themtop  us bank testimonialthis relationship began after this client’s bank owned life insurance boli portfolio grew from  billion to  billion following a material merger the company realized it was time to reassess the combined portfolio evaluate its options and ultimately restructure to improve both the economics and risk profile according to the bank’s managing director we spoke to many consultants and carriers to understand what we needed to do and what type of resources were available our  billion portfolio involved  different carriers and a complexity of products with every bell and whistle you can imagine if you look at all the different considerations – tax risk credit risk regulatory risk reputation risk economic and relationship issues – you have all these different dynamics and complexities that need to be managed on a parallel basis otherwise you are not going to get the best result and you can put yourself in a position to actually increasing your risk instead of mitigating it it was critical for the bank and its consultant service provider to be in sync in order to maximize the result what we still ended up with is still  different carriers but the composition and structure is more unique with improved economics a lower risk profile and increased flexibility in the future to manage the investment allocations the objective was to save money to mitigate credit risks to not increase tax risks to improve investment flexibility and to make sure we were compliant from a risk management point of view which is dictated by banking regulations the banks major concern in restructuring “was not underestimating or having an accurate analysis of the benefits and the execution risk it was key to have a firm that we were comfortable with at all levels so we could execute the plan we developed a great relationship with lynch lynch is a breed apart from what is out there in the industry and really sets the standard for what banks and insurance companies need to do with respect to these insurance products the bank initially hired lynch  associates to reevaluate and restructure its portfolio a process that took about two years to complete subsequently lynch was retained to provide comprehensive administrative investment analytics risk management and regulatory compliance services for the entire  billion asset portfolio the space that theyre in specific to the services they provide to us is pretty unique and obscure and because of that it presents a significant number of challenges for both insurance carriers and banks to access a firm like lynch  associates effectively is a conduit that both carriers and banks need to access the bankowned corporateowned life insurance market so we can obtain the best economic benefits and at the same time do it in a way that doesnt introduce risk associated with the accounting and tax aspects and is also regulatory compliant they are not just brokers they provide a very unique service to this market space their business model is based on that they are not a commissiondriven shop like many of the others in the marketplace are today they provide real value added and that is what truly differentiates them from their competition

capacity in the future testimonials corporate testimonialthis fortune  global firms relationship with lynch  associates dates back to the late ’s the firm first brought lynch in to assume broker services for its existing corporateowned life insurance coli policies that had been purchased to support a deferred compensation plan although this initial engagement was one plan only it was not long before the company turned to lynch to consolidate its entire portfolio of coli investments and deferred compensation plans during a six month review the lynch team completed an evaluation of all the different colis spelled out the terms and conditions that were in place and identified ways to further optimize the programs the firm’s director of retirement investments said basically we hired lynch as a global coli oversight adviser they get a fee based on certain assets under management and they need to achieve savings in the amount of the fee every year to be paid that fee so our interests are aligned another thing they did was help us gain additional flexibility in one of our larger accounts to more effectively hedge our growing liabilities they worked with metlife for probably a year and a half to get this done i had been trying to accomplish this for two or three years and was never successful as a result we got an additional  million in variable insurance capacity to hedge our growing marktomarket equity and fixed income liabilities lynch  associates took over the companys tracking system and optimized it so the entire deferred compensation program can be viewed across multiple operating companies and tracked against the coli program to assess the effectiveness of the hedging strategy were delighted with that they saved us  million in hard costs by reducing expenditures they restructured an existing set of policies and saved us  million present value dollars in premiums they took all of our insurance policies ran them in their system and found  million in death benefits that had not been obtained by our existing third party administrators all of that was just in  the company official believes that lynch differs from its competitors in the personal and customized service it offers this is a small group that is highly specialized i am able to put that team in front of our most senior executives to explain these programs and they always acquit themselves well we have the same team dealing with us now that we have had for almost  years they absolutely understand what we want and are willing to customize the information in any way that we request we have always been very well served by lynch and i am delighted with the relationship corporateowned life insurance policies go on for decades so this relationship will go on through the remainder of my career but eventually i am going to retire and someone else is going to have to take this over they are going to need lynchutility testimoniala large east coast utility engaged lynch and associates for its executive compensation plan and was pleased with the work so when the need arose to restructure a nuclear decommissioning trust they approached lynch to bid on the project it involved a complicated move of the utility from one service agent to another as well as bringing the trust from a general account program to a separate account program to give the utility more protection it was a large trust more than  million with lots of moving parts lynch won the business and immediately went to work sorting out all the component parts which turned out to be a messy proposition one of the first things discovered was that some previous insurance carriers handling the ndt accounts had not done their work properly creating tax liability problems for the utility the utilitys treasurer noted how lynch  associates not only discovered the problem but moved quickly to resolve it we had to clean that up with the regulators they discovered the problem took the initiative to correct it and got us through it kudos to them they handled things admirably they stay on top of things in addition to this complication many of the policies under the previous program were not operating at maximum efficiency and effectiveness and lynch worked diligently to close out these old policies and transfer cash to a new program for active employees all the while ensuring that in moving from a general account to a separate account program for active employees there was enough money left in the old program to protect the companys retirees that is not our area of expertise it is very technical and that is why we are very dependent on lynch  associates we are very satisfied with them because they have a lot of expertise the firm provides tremendous customer service they are always available when you need them and are very open to discussions they are friendly engaging people and you like working with themtop  us bank testimonialthis relationship began after this client’s bank owned life insurance boli portfolio grew from  billion to  billion following a material merger the company realized it was time to reassess the combined portfolio evaluate its options and ultimately restructure to improve both the economics and risk profile according to the bank’s managing director we spoke to many consultants and carriers to understand what we needed to do and what type of resources were available our  billion portfolio involved  different carriers and a complexity of products with every bell and whistle you can imagine if you look at all the different considerations – tax risk credit risk regulatory risk reputation risk economic and relationship issues – you have all these different dynamics and complexities that need to be managed on a parallel basis otherwise you are not going to get the best result and you can put yourself in a position to actually increasing your risk instead of mitigating it it was critical for the bank and its consultant service provider to be in sync in order to maximize the result what we still ended up with is still  different carriers but the composition and structure is more unique with improved economics a lower risk profile and increased flexibility in the future to manage the investment allocations the objective was to save money to mitigate credit risks to not increase tax risks to improve investment flexibility and to make sure we were compliant from a risk management point of view which is dictated by banking regulations the banks major concern in restructuring “was not underestimating or having an accurate analysis of the benefits and the execution risk it was key to have a firm that we were comfortable with at all levels so we could execute the plan we developed a great relationship with lynch lynch is a breed apart from what is out there in the industry and really sets the standard for what banks and insurance companies need to do with respect to these insurance products the bank initially hired lynch  associates to reevaluate and restructure its portfolio a process that took about two years to complete subsequently lynch was retained to provide comprehensive administrative investment analytics risk management and regulatory compliance services for the entire  billion asset portfolio the space that theyre in specific to the services they provide to us is pretty unique and obscure and because of that it presents a significant number of challenges for both insurance carriers and banks to access a firm like lynch  associates effectively is a conduit that both carriers and banks need to access the bankowned corporateowned life insurance market so we can obtain the best economic benefits and at the same time do it in a way that doesnt introduce risk associated with the accounting and tax aspects and is also regulatory compliant they are not just brokers they provide a very unique service to this market space their business model is based on that they are not a commissiondriven shop like many of the others in the marketplace are today they provide real value added and that is what truly differentiates them from their competition
