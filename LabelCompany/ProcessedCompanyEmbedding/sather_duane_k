commissioner of internal revenue appellee no      decided june   before wollman chief judge hansen and murphy circuit judgesthomas f arends schaumburg illinois argued for appellant karen d utiger washington dc argued paula m junghans and thomas j clark on the brief for appellee the internal revenue service irs imposed gift tax deficiencies and accuracyrelated penalties on larry sather kathy sather john sather sandra sather duane sather and diane sather related to gifts made by each of them in  and assessed transferee liability for gift tax deficiencies and penalties against the duane k sather irrevocable trust the duane trust the larry l sather irrevocable trust the larry trust and the john r sather irrevocable trust the john trust related to gifts received by the trusts in  from the abovenamed individuals   the tax court dismissed the assessments against duane and diane sather as untimely as to the remaining sathers and their related trusts the tax court found that the transactions at issue involved crossgifts denied claimed annual exclusions and upheld the tax deficiencies and a portion of the penalties   we affirm the imposition of gift tax deficiencies but reverse the accuracyrelated penaltiesithis case involves the transfer of stock in a closelyheld family business from one generation to the next   the sather brothers larry john duane and rodney collectively the “brothers” along with larrys johns and duanes wives kathy sandra and diane respectively collectively the “wives” owned  of the stock in sather inc which they previously received from the brothers parents   at the time of the transfers at issue rodney was unmarried and had no children   larry john and duane each had three children   in an effort to transfer the stock of sather inc to the next generation of sathers the brothers consulted their accountant for advice on structuring the transfer   upon their accountants advice larry john and duane and each of their respective wives transferred  worth of stock to each of their children and to each of their nieces and nephews on december     larry john and duane also transferred additional shares to their own children to effect the full transfer of sather inc stock to the next generation of sathers   on january   larry john and duane each transferred  worth of stock to each of their nieces and nephews and approximately  worth of stock to each of their own children   the wives each transferred  worth of stock to each of their own children  the transfers were made to irrevocable trusts for each set of children larrys johns and duaneseach donor filed a separate gift tax return for  claiming nine  gift tax exclusions one for each donee each individuals own three children and six nieces and nephews or nine nieces and nephews in rodneys case   each donor likewise filed a gift tax return for  again claiming nine  gift tax exclusions and electing to have each gift treated as made onehalf by each spouse as allowed under the internal revenue code irc §   usc §     on august   the irs issued notices of gift tax deficiencies and penalties to each of the individual donors for the  tax period   on october   the irs issued notices of gift tax deficiencies and penalties to each trust as transferee for the  tax period  the irs allowed only three  exclusions per year for each of the donorslarry kathy john sandra duane and dianeand assessed gift taxes and penalties based on the remaining transfers   the irs reasoned that the gifts to each of the donors own children were valid gifts but that the gifts to each niece and nephew were constructive gifts to the donors own childreneach donor and each trust filed separate petitions in the united states tax court challenging the deficiencies penalties and transferee liability   the tax court consolidated the cases for trial purposes and tried the consolidated cases on june     the tax court issued a memorandum findings of fact and opinion on september   dismissing the assessments against duane and diane sather as untimely and upholding the deficiency assessments against the remaining donors for the  gifts and against the transferee trusts for the  gifts   the tax court also upheld the accuracyrelated penalties based on transfers made by kathy sandra and diane but dismissed the penalties based on transfers made by larry john and duane finding that the brothers but not their respective wives had reasonably relied on their accountant and attorney   the tax court entered judgment in each case on november  ii appellate jurisdictionwe have jurisdiction over appeals from tax court cases pursuant to section  of the internal revenue code the irs argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal however because the appellants filed a single notice of appeal   while we recognize that a notice of appeal is jurisdictional see klaudt v united states dept of the interior  fd   th cir we hold that the notice in this case was sufficient to confer jurisdiction for each of the cases a notice of appeal is liberally construed and mere technicalities will not foreclose the courts review particularly where the intent to appeal is apparent and there is no prejudice to the adverse party   see id   the sathers notice of appeal was filed on december   well within the  days allowed to appeal from a tax court decision   see fed rapp p a  rule  of the federal rules of appellate procedure requires that the notice of appeal “specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice”  fed rapp p ca   however “an appeal must not be dismissed ․ for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice”   fed rapp p c emphasis added   the emphasized part of the rule was added in  in response to the supreme courts torres v oakland scavenger co  us   sct   ledd   opinion where the supreme court held that a notice which inadvertently omitted the name of one of  interveners was insufficient to effect an appeal for that individual   see  us at   sct   see also fed rapp p   amendments note to subdivision c discussing change in rule  following torres   “the test ․ for determining whether   designations other than by name are sufficient is whether it is objectively clear that a party intended to appeal”  fed rapp p   amendments note to subdivision c para  the notice of appeal named the appellants as “larry l sather donor et al” and listed the docket numbers for each of the nine cases which had been consolidated for trial purposes below  app at    the notice stated that “the petitioners larry l sather et al hereby appeal ․ from the decision of the tax court entered in the abovecaptioned consolidated proceeding on the seventeenth day of september ”  id the decision referred to in the notice is the consolidated memorandum opinion which likewise named the petitioners as “larry l sather donor et al” in its caption   based on these facts the notice satisfied rule ca   cf torres  us at   sct  noting that the appellant “was never named or otherwise designated ” on the notice of appeal emphasis added  twenty mile joint venture pnd ltd v commr  fd   th cir finding rule  not met because there was no mention of a particular party in the notice of appeal by name or docket number   dodgers bar  grill inc v johnson county bd of county commrs  fd   th cir holding that a notice stating that “appeal is by dodgers ‘and the other individuallynamed plaintiffs is sufficient to confer jurisdiction”rule c also requires designation of “the judgment order or part thereof being appealed”  fed rapp p cb   although the notice specified the memorandum opinion rather than the individual judgments as the decision from which an appeal was sought the notice sufficiently put the irs on notice that the final judgments were being appealed   the judgments contained only the final disposition of each case which was also evident from the memorandum opinion   the irs conceded at oral argument that it was not prejudiced by the notice   the appellants reference to the memorandum opinion satisfied rule cb   see hawkins v city of farmington  fd    n  th cir holding that where intent to appeal an order not specifically named in the notice of appeal is apparent and the appellee is not prejudiced the court may hear the appealthe cases cited by the irs concerning the consolidation of appeals do not support the irss position that the notice of appeal was insufficient   there is no requirement that separate notices of appeal be filed on separate pieces of paper   the irs had sufficient notice that an appeal was being taken from each individual case   further the appellants in the cases relied upon by the irs attempted to use a timelyfiled notice of appeal for one case to boot strap an appeal for a related case which had been consolidated for trial purposes only but which had been disposed of at an earlier date   the notice of appeal was untimely as to the disposition of one of the cases and our brethren held in both instances that because the cases were not consolidated for disposition purposes the notice of appeal was untimely as to the previously dismissed case   see mendel v prod credit assn of the midlands  fd   th cir holding a notice of appeal covering two “informally consolidated” cases untimely as to one because of the timing of the district courts disposition of motions to reconsider in each not commenting on the fact that both were included in the same notice of appeal  page v commr  fd   th cir holding similarly where a motion to revise one tax court decision stayed the running of the time to appeal for that case but not the “informally consolidated” case for which no similar motion was filed cert denied  us   sct   ledd     they did not hold that the notice of appeal was insufficient because it was on the same piece of paper as the notice for another informally consolidated caseii reciprocal giftsthe internal revenue code imposes a tax “on the transfer of property by gift” irc § a “whether the gift is direct or indirect” irc § a   the first  worth of gifts of a present interest made to any person in a calendar year is excluded from the definition of a taxable gift   irc § b   thus it is not uncommon for taxpayers to avoid the gift tax by structuring gifts just below the  exclusion limit   this case requires us to determine whether the gifts in this case similar gifts made by the donors to each others children are really crossgifts that is indirect gifts to their own children the tax court found that the cumulative transfers at issue lacked economic substance relying on the reciprocal trust doctrine   the sathers argue that there is economic substance to the transactions as a whole when rodneys gifts to the nieces and nephews are considered as is required by the steptransaction doctrine   whether a transaction lacks economic substance and whether several transactions should be considered integrated steps of a single transaction are both fact questions which we review for clear error see lee v commr  fd   d cir reviewing economic substance  robino inc pension trust v commr  fd   th cir reviewing steptransaction doctrinethe reciprocal trust doctrine a variation of the substance over form concept see exch bank and trust co of fla v united states  fd   fedcir was developed in the context of trusts to prevent taxpayers from transferring similar property in trust to each other as life tenants thus removing the property from the settlors estate and avoiding estate taxes while receiving identical property for their lifetime enjoyment that would likewise not be included in their estate   see united states v graces estate  us    sct   ledd     the supreme court held that the reciprocal trust doctrine applies to multiple transactions when the transactions are interrelated and “to the extent of mutual value leave  the settlors in approximately the same economic position as they would have been in had they created trusts naming themselves as life beneficiaries”  id at   sct    the doctrine seeks to discern the reality of the transaction  “ ‘the fact that the trusts are reciprocated or ‘crossed’ is a trifle quite lacking in practical or legal significance ”  id at   sct  quoting lehman v commr  fd   d cir cert denied  us   sct   led   substance over form analysis applies equally to gift tax cases   see eg heyen v united states  fd   th cir  chanin v united states  ctcl   fd   ctcl   it is impliedly included in the gift tax statute itselfincluding indirect transfers within the definition of a taxable gift   see irc § a   “the terms ‘property’ ‘transfer’ ‘gift’ and ‘indirectly’ are used in the broadest and most comprehensive sense  ․ the words ‘transfer ․ by gift’ and ‘whether ․ direct or indirect’ are designed to cover and comprehend all transactions ․ whereby ․ property or a property right is donatively passed ․ ” dickman v commr  us    sct   ledd   quoting hrrep no  nd cong st sess   and srep no  nd cong st sess   some alterations in original   application of the reciprocal trust doctrine  is likewise appropriate in the gift tax context as a method for discerning the substance of gift transfers  “ ‘the purpose of the doctrine is merely to identify the transferor of property’ ”  exchange bank  fd at  quoting bischoff v commr  tc    wl     once the transferor is identified the tax code determines whether the transfer is subject to tax  idapplying the reciprocal trust doctrine to this case there can be no doubt that the gifts were interrelated   the sather brothers together sought advice on how to transfer the stock to the next generation of sathers   the transfers to all the children were made on the same days and were for the same amounts of stock   we cannot say that the tax court erredclearly or otherwisein determining that the transfers were interrelatedthe second prong of the graces estate analysis requires that “the settlors be left in approximately the same economic position as they would have been in had they created trusts naming themselves as life beneficiaries”  graces estate  us at   sct    we do not believe that the supreme court meant to limit the doctrine to cases involving life estate trusts or even to cases where the donor retains an economic interest but used that language in the context of the specific facts of the case   see eg exchange bank  fd at  holding that the doctrine applies to transfers made under the florida gifts to minors act wherein each spouse transferred equal amounts of property to their children naming the other spouse as custodian  “graces estate does not speak in terms of a retained economic interestrather that the arrangement ‘leaves the settlors in approximately the same economic position ․’ ” id at    in this case the parents transferred stock to their nieces and nephews in exchange for transfers to their own children by the nieces and nephews parents   though the sathers received no direct economic value in the exchange they did receive an economic benefit by indirectly benefitting their own children   the donors were in the same economic positionthe position of passing their assets to their childrenby entering the crosstransactions as if they had made direct gifts of all of their stock to their own children  applying the analysis of the reciprocal trust doctrine we hold that these interrelated gifts were reciprocal transactions that must be uncrossed to reach the substance of the transactions   see schultz v united states  fd   th cir disallowing gift tax exclusions where two brothers made gifts to each others children as well as their own the purpose of the second graces estate prong is to discern the taxability of the transactions as uncrossed in the context of a particular set of facts   see exchange bank  fd at  discussing bischoff    uncrossing the gifts in the present case the tax court made the factual finding that each immediate family was in the same position as if each donor had made gifts only to the donors own children   thus using the reciprocal trust doctrine to identify the actual transferor each donor made transfers to each of his or her own children but no gifts to any of the nieces and nephews   see schultz  fd at    we cannot say that the tax court clearly erred in making this factual finding   under irc § b each transferorlarry kathy john sandra duane and dianewas entitled to one  exclusion for gifts made to each uncrossed donee their own children for each year in which gifts were made   because each transferor has only three children but claimed nine exclusions the irs correctly determined that the transferors understated their gift tax liabilitiesthe sathers argue that the steptransaction doctrine requires us to consider the gifts made by rodney to each of his nieces and nephews and that in so doing we will find economic substance in the whole transaction   each of larrys johns and duanes immediate families had a net increase in economic value while rodneys immediate family consisting only of himself had a net decrease in economic value   true as this may be it does not change the fact that uncrossing the reciprocal gifts leaves each of the transferors in the same position as if he or she had transferred stock only to his or her own children   the purpose of the reciprocal trust doctrine is to discern the actual transferorrodneys transfers do not affect the reality of the other transferors gifts which amounted to a transfer of their own stock to their own childrenthe sathers also argue that the tax court erred in excluding evidence of their intent which was purportedly to transfer the stock to the next generation of sathers not to avoid taxes   noting that the subjective intent of the parties particularly when the parties are related “creates substantial obstacles to the proper application of the federal estate tax laws” the supreme court held that “ ‘taxability ․ depends on the nature and operative effect of the trust transfer’ ”  grace  us at   sct  quoting estate of spiegel v commr  us    sct   led     the same holds true for federal gift tax laws   it is not “necessary to prove the existence of a taxavoidance motive”  id at   sct    rather “an objective analysis of the parties economic positions should predominate”  exchange bank  fd at    thus the sathers argument regarding their intent is only marginally if at all relevant   additionally the tax court did consider the stated intent in its opinion but dismissed it as irrelevant  see add a at     thus the tax court did not abuse its discretion in excluding any evidence regarding the sathers subjective intent   see little v commr  fd   th cir standard of review for exclusion of evidence in appeal from tax courtiii transferee liabilitythe parties do not dispute that a transferee is directly liable for gift tax if the tax is not paid by the donor when it is due   see irc § b  mississippi valley trust co v commr  fd   th cir construing the predecessor of b   the only real issue raised regarding transferee liability is the fact that the irs assessments of liability mailed to the larry trust and to the duane trust named the wrong donorthe tax assessment sent to the larry trust named diane duanes wife as the donor for whom the trust was being assessed the tax   likewise sandra johns wife was named as the donor in the assessment sent to the duane trust   based on the irss disallowance of gifts to the nieces and nephews the trusts should have been assessed transferee liability for gifts made by the wife of the settlor kathys gift tax liability should have been assessed against the larry trust and dianes gift tax liability should have been assessed against the duane trustthe trusts argue that the irs has failed to meet its burden of proof regarding the assessment of transferee liability see irc § a commissioner has burden of proving the petitioner is liable as a transferee of property of a taxpayer but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax because there was no evidence offered as to the correct donorthe irs must prove only that the transferee was the recipient of a taxable transfer the gift tax was not paid when due and the extent of the value of the gift   see irc § b “if the gift tax is not paid when due the donee of any gift shall be personally liable for such tax to the extent of the value of such gift”   the parties agree that each wife made gifts of slightly under  to each of her own children in trust and to each of her nieces and nephews in trust   the gift tax returns indicating these transfers were introduced at trial  app at  stipulation of facts ¶¶    the tax court determined that the gifts made to each wifes six nieces and nephews were reciprocal gifts and found them to be indirect gifts to each wifes own three children via the trusts   we have now affirmed that finding by the tax court   because the total amount of the uncrossed gifts made to each wifes children during  exceeded the  annual exclusion each trust was the recipient of a taxable transfer   the parties stipulated that no gift taxes were paid for any gifts made in   app at  stipulation of facts ¶    the parties do not dispute the amounts of any of the gifts or that the gifts exceed the amount of the assessed deficiencies   thus the irs has met its burden of establishing that the trusts were donees of gifts for which gift taxes have not been paid and that the gifts exceed the amount of the assessments   the appellants contention has no merit to the extent that the trusts take issue with the notices of deficiency stating the wrong donor the notices were sufficient to place the trusts on notice of the assessment  “the irc does not specify the form or content of the notice   the purpose of the notice is only to advise the person who is to pay the deficiency that the commissioner means to assess him  anything that does this unequivocally is good enough   thus the notice generally must indicate that a deficiency has been determined and identify the taxpayer the taxable year involved and the amount of the deficiency   in short the notice must meet the general fairness requirements of due process”  estate of yaeger v commr  fd   d cir internal citations and quotations omitted cert denied  us   sct   ledd     the trusts do not argue that they were denied due process or otherwise treated unfairly by the notices   they argue only that because the notices stated the incorrect donor the irs has not met its burden of proving the identity of the donor   despite the incorrect notices as we stated above the stipulated facts and the tax courts finding of reciprocated gifts satisfy the requisite burden of proving the transferee liabilitythat the trusts were recipients of gifts for which gift tax was owed and not paidiv accuracyrelated penalties section a imposes an accuracyrelated penalty of twenty percent of “any portion of an underpayment of tax required to be shown on a return” if the underpayment is attributable to inter alia negligence   irc §§ a b   the tax code creates an exception to the accuracyrelated penalty for reasonable cause if the taxpayer acted in good faith  irc § c   reliance on tax professionals does not necessarily constitute reasonable cause but may if all pertinent facts and circumstances are taken into account and the advice is not based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions   see treas   reg §§ b c   additionally “reliance may not be reasonable or in good faith if the taxpayer knew or should have known that the advisor lacked knowledge in the relevant aspects of federal tax law”   treas  reg § c   aside from whether reliance on the tax professional constituted reasonable cause the taxpayer must still rely on the advice in good faith   we review the tax courts factual determinations of whether a taxpayer qualifies for the reasonable cause exception for clear error   see srivastava v commr  fd   th cir  parrish v commr  fd   th cirthe tax court found that the sather brothers reasonably and in good faith relied on the advice of their longtime accountant and attorney  add a at    the sathers sought the advice of their accountant whose  years of experience as an accountant included employment with the irs for the purpose of structuring the transfer of stock   the accountant conferred with the sathers longtime attorney   the accountant prepared all of the gift tax returns at issue   the irs does not dispute nor did it appeal the issue that the sather brothers reasonably relied in good faith on their accountants advice the tax court felt constrained to hold otherwise with respect to the sather wives however because none of the wives testified at trial about their reliance and the tax court found no other evidence of their reliance   bound by the presumption in favor of a penalty assessment by the irs and the taxpayers burden of proving error see little  fd at  the tax court found that there was “no evidence in this record as to what steps the  wives took to ensure their returns were proper”  add a at    we believe this finding is clearly erroneous however as there was evidence of the wives reliance on the accountant whom the tax court found to be a competent advisor and fully informed of the relevant factsthe wives each filed separate gift tax returns from their respective husbands for both years involved   however each wifes gift tax returns were nearly identical to her husbands   as noted by the tax court the accountant prepared all the returns including the wives returns   advice is defined by the treasury regulations as “any communication ․ setting forth the analysis or conclusion of a person other than the taxpayer provided to ․ the taxpayer and on which the taxpayer relies directly or indirectly ․ advice does not have to be in any particular form”   treas  reg § c emphasis added   we believe the tax court erroneously declined to consider the fact that the wives each signed a gift tax return prepared by their respective husbands accountant and nearly identical to their husbands return as evidence that the wives also relied upon the accountant   for the same reasons that the sather brothers reliance was reasonable and in good faith we believe that the wives reliance evidenced by signing and filing returns prepared by the accountant was likewise reasonable and in good faith   we thus reverse the imposition of accuracyrelated penalties and vacate those penalties as against kathy sather and sandra sather related to the  returns and as against each of the trusts as transferees related to the  returns filed by each of the wivesv conclusionthe transfers of stock to each donors nieces and nephews were reciprocal transfers or crossgifts made in exchange for identical transfers from the nieces and nephews parents to the donors own children   as such the transfers must be uncrossed and the tax code applied to the substance of the transactions   the irs correctly determined that each donor was entitled to three  exclusions   the signed returns prepared by the accountant found by the tax court to be a reliable advisor provide sufficient evidence of kathys sandras and dianes reliance and afford them the protection of the reasonable cause exception to the accuracyrelated penalties   we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the tax courts decisionfootnotes   the irs does not appeal this ruling   rodney also made transfers of approximately  worth of stock to each of his nieces and nephews on both dates and made transfers to the other brothers but those transfers are not at issue here   rodney was not assessed any additional tax as the transfers to his nieces nephews and brothers were all bona fide transfers  neither he nor his immediate family he had none received anything in exchange   the irs assessed the taxes for  against the trusts rather than the individuals because the statute of limitations had run against the donors   transferee liability may be assessed for one year past the donors statutory period which expires three years after the return is filed   see irc §§ a c   this appeal was originally filed in the seventh circuit because the tax court was located within that circuit   it was transferred to the eighth circuit pursuant to irc § ba   the tax court has taken to calling it the “reciprocal transaction doctrine” in the context of reciprocal indirect transfers outside the trust arena   see schuler v commr  wl  tax ct dec   relying in part on the tax courts opinion in this case to hold that gifts by the taxpayer of stock of one familyowned company to the taxpayers brothers children in exchange for gifts of stock of another familyowned company by the brother to the taxpayers children were in essence gifts to the taxpayers children   in so holding we are careful not to focus only on the economic position of the donees as suggested recently by the tax court   see schuler  wl  “the relevant inquiry in reciprocal indirect transfer cases is whether the transferees are in approximately the same economic position ․”hansen circuit judge findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel academic judicial clerk summer associate intern law
