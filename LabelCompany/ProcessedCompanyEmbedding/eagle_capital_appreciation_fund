fund the fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in companies that the portfolio management team believes havethe potential for attractive longterm growth in earnings cash flow and total worth of

an affiliate of eagle asset management inc and the subadvisor to the capital appreciation fund and assumed management of the fund after the market closed on june   investment process investmentteam key facts holdings performance literature strategy the managers philosophy centers on two core beliefs about investing first all things eg companies industries sectors and economies cycle second most people forget or inefficiently react to this first thing the manager focuses on identifying companies that surprise the market by their participation in an earnings growth cycle the team seeks to earn excess return as corresponding investor cynicism about this participation declines from elevated levels initial investments are focused on companies that have recently entered or are extending an earnings cycle they tend to have an improving foundation of earnings cash flow sales etc and are typically surrounded by some level of cynicism or investor neglect the selection process is built on the idea that good investing discipline starts with an explicit identification of what one is looking for combined with the willingness and ability to look broadly for it the manager believes quantitative tools are particularly good at addressing both these requirements they force the investor to clearly identify the type of investment opportunity he or she seeks while allowing the investor to objectively look across a broad universe for those opportunities starting the process with quantitative tools provides confidence that opportunities fit within the teams philosophy but the manager believes that the subjective nature of investing requires the steady hand of an experienced professional the managers longtenured investment professionals use their judgment and expertise to confirm potential investment ideas uncovered by the process the final decision is theirs to make goals take advantage of the breadth provided by quantitative tools and the depth of qualitative analysis to identify both the rewards and the risks associated with potential investments maximize portfolio diversification through explicit early identification of the risks associated with each potential investment idea earn excess return by buying companies that surprise the market as they overcome negative or cynical sentiment   a word about risk as with all equity investing there is the risk that an unexpected change in the market or within the company itself may have an adverse effect on its stock the biggest risk of equity investing is that returns can fluctuate and investors can lose money growth companies are expected to increase their earnings at a certain rate when these expectations are not met investors may punish the stocks excessively even if earnings showed an absolute increase growth company stocks also typically lack the dividend yield that can cushion stock prices in market downturns   hrcmx news  eagle capital appreciation fundr company news  press

stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics
