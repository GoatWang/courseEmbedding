chairman president and ceo of vf corporation  the robin report navigation the robin report subscribesign up join our email list branding qa with eric c wiseman chairman president and ceo of vf corporation september   by robin lewis robin lewis so right off the bat how the heck can one person run a  to  billion company eric wiseman you can’t vf has been and i hope always will be a team sport when i look at the leadership teams around vf there’s no question that we have really talented people but we don’t have “superstars” what we do have is people who work extremely well together who compliment each others talents and who are committed to the teams success that dynamic drives whatever success we’ve had and since you know me pretty well you obviously know that i’m not capable of “running” vf…if i was i’d have a much different balance in my life rl so eric the numbers on vf under your watch as ceo speak for themselves and they would say you’re doing a great job ew for about five years now since we’ve changed directions corporately we’ve been executing on the right things so when you execute against the right things it generally works for you rl going into the last half of this year against a rather negative global and us economic backdrop do you want to revise your earlier  growth projection for  or at least hedge your bets and if so in what areas of the business ew well so far this year is playing out as we planned it to we get a lot of advice of course as we put together our annual plans we thought this year we could grow  organically – we have some wraparound from timberland in our number – and we expected the headwinds to increase as the year went on so here we are half way through the year and we grew  in the first half which is right on what we planned we expect to grow at less than  in the last half of the year to get to an overall  organic growth number for the year i don’t know exactly how it’s going to go for the second two quarters but we expect it to slow down for the reasons you mentioned but so far it has played out about as we thought and we’re right on track rl given this tough and sure to get tougher environment where are the “white spaces” the opportunities for vf going forward ew china india south america russia and turkey are geographic white spaces where we have not yet brought the full potential of our brand portfolio to life the next big white space is taking our big brands and making them bigger the truth is no one ever thought that a brand like the north face or vans would be where they are today when we bought them the north face was a  million brand and vans was just over  million today the north face is closing in on  billion and vans is at  billion and they both think they can add another billion dollars in the next five years these guys haven’t missed a plan since we’ve owned them it’s an interesting point that just three or four years ago we had one brand wrangler that was a billion dollars in size today we have five lee the north face vans and timberland in addition to wrangler and that didn’t happen accidentally we really focused investment on brands we thought had broadreach capabilities and we really drove those investments during the recent recession we thought “let’s do something different and increase our advertising spend by  million and put half of it on the global growth of the north face and vans because we didn’t think our competitors would have that size checkbook” we took our ad spend up from  million to  million dollars in one year and focused it on a few opportunities that accelerated our growth rates the next big white space for us is the really interesting opportunity to develop our smaller brands like kipling napapijri and lucy when we bought them they were between  and  million and kipling’s well past the  million mark now ten years ago vf used to be very democratic with our resources we took a peanut butterspread approach across the organization four years ago we said ‘no no no we’re not going to do that we may starve a few brands but we’re going to go where we see the best return for our shareholders short and longterm’ and we’ve really been aggressive in expanding our investment behind a few brands and a few markets and it’s worked really well rl why the focus on outdoor action sports brands now close to  percent of the business vs more traditional fashion andor casual apparel ew back in  and  we conducted very thorough strategic planning working weekly on ‘what should vf look like in five years’ and that effort was under mackey’s leadership former ceo mackey mcdonaldwe looked hard at different segments of the industry and made choices about what our shape should look like five years down the road one of the things we looked at was the growth dynamics in apparel and footwear we looked at the earnings multiples of the public companies that were in that space we looked at the brands and which brands had emotional connections with their consumers we looked at the financial metrics the returns and out of all that the outdoor and action sports industry became a place that we really wanted to be apparel and footwear in that sector are worn by people when they’re pursuing their passions whether they’re backcountry skiing mountain climbing hiking with their children or camping what they wear matters to them because it has a function and most importantly in some cases a lifesaving function people develop real emotional connections with that stuff and we said ‘that’s where we can grow’ those brands are sustainable if you can keep the emotional connection strong also it isn’t as dependent on fashion trends and mountaineering surfing or skating are global activities so you can speak to people in many countries so we decided to acquire and build in that space at the same time we decided that the intimate apparel category didn’t fit that model for us there aren’t very many global intimate apparel brands that have equal success around the world and that’s why we got out of that business rl what fits in vf’s future and why and how does imagewear fit in your portfolio and what are its growth drivers ew we describe ourselves as active portfolio managers and at least once a year we go through a very formal process of looking at each business and identifying the strategic reasons that it should be a part of our future imagewear is a huge winner for us that business is very profitable and generates a lot of cash here’s the surprise vf’s fastest growing brand for the last six quarters has been bulwark which makes flameresistant apparel we sell it to the oil and gas exploration industry power companies linemen i honor the brand that grows the fastest in the prior quarter by drinking exclusively out of one of their water bottles i carry my bulwark water bottle to every single meeting i carry it when i speak to audiences – i put it proudly on the podium so people can see the label and for the last year and a half i have been carrying a bulwark bottle rl your directtoconsumerbusiness grew at a meteoric rate with this segment expected to continue to grow faster than your wholesale business particularly as many of your brands are selling into traditional mass and mainstream retail channels that are slowgrowing how long before over  of vf corporations’ business will be directtoconsumer ew we are going to open about  to  stores this year and our target has been to get  of our revenue from our stores what’s really interesting is when we were at  three years ago we thought we’d get to  really quickly but what’s happened is that our wholesale business including the wholesale revenues that we make to the partners who own and operate other freestanding stores has actually been higher than our retail growth in china for example we find partners who can open stores for vans kipling or the north face whatever the brand is and when that happens they are obviously buying the product from us they lease the building hire the staff which we help train and have their own operating system that runs their stores but we have a lot of input into the content of the store including the products fixturing and instore point of sale that we either provide or give them the design guidelines everything inside the store has to meet our visual standards so we have a guide for what a north face store or a vans store or a kipling store should look like and they’ve got to meet that standard we want it to be transparent for the consumer it shouldn’t matter to them who owns the store – all that should matter to them is the brand experience we count all of that revenue as wholesale and it’s one reason our wholesale growth rate has stayed really robust related   what’s a specialty hardtoship product to do in an amazon worldthe wild card is the digital relationship we’re building with consumers who want to come to our websites to hear our stories and many of them are now buying from us online it’s a wild card because we can’t control that we want to have really rich digital content and engagement with consumers because we have a lot of brands that resonate with young people and it’s important that we’re relevant to them while they’re there you know a lot of them want to go shopping so all in all we’re talking about  to  contribution from our directtoconsumer business rl considering that it doesn’t matter whether you call it wholesale or retail since it’s really about controlling the brand and it destiny how has your business at jc penney fared during their business decline and are you committing to their major shopinshop program ew the only results we’ve all seen so far are for the first quarter and we did better in the first quarter than they did overall so we were a positive in their mix i don’t know about the second quarter yet lee is our biggest business our second biggest business there is vans our third is our licensed sports business – all the team jersey stuff – and the fourth is jansport we have been part of the submission process for  for the in shop in store program and our hope is that we would be selected for that process we’re confident that we will be ron has a very clear vision for what he thinks the opportunity is for jc penney i don’t know that he’s wrong so we’re engaged trying to make penney’s work just like we’re engaged with kohl’s or macy’s or rei or dick’s sporting goods trying to help their model work rl why are there no fullprice nautica stores at this point ew we had other areas to address at nautica first and to the great credit of that team they have methodically addressed them we had an outlet operation that wasn’t operating at the right level a year ago today it is we had a wholesale business that wasn’t operating at its potential and today it is we had a licensing business there that had a few years of going in the wrong direction it’s doing very well right now so we are actively discussing where nautica’s fullprice retail stores should be and what they should look like and my expectation would be in the next year we’ll be opening a couple of those rl your supply chain has been a “competitive weapon” for many years according to mackey your predecessor what is your sourcing strategy the “third way” and why don’t you use thirdparty sourcing agents ew vf corporation this year will sell about  million units of apparel and footwear so when you divide that back into  days a year we shipped every day of the year we have to sell and ship one and a quarter million pieces a day so when we talk about our supply chain as a competitive weapon it starts with how incredibly diverse and sophisticated we have to be to do that and serve our customers at a high level doing that we own just  of the factories that we operate we use about  contractor facilities not all at the same time and not all year long we have  associates so it’s a really big well run complicated piece of our company we use very few thirdparty sourcing agents only when they can do something that we can’t or they can do something at a higher quality and lower cost than we can we usually find that the service quality and cost is best if we control the whole process and we service our customers at a very high level with very low inventories because we have this really diverse network the “third way” is when we utilize proprietary factory engineering and proprietary factory equipment a lot of equipment that’s in our factories is designed engineered and constructed by us we take some of those skills and we’ll go to a dedicated partner so a factory that works only on our products and we will take what we know about running a factory some of what we know not all because we have a few secrets that we keep to ourselves and we take some of that and teach that factory how to do it because a lot of the sourced factories that we use whether they be in vietnam or china or wherever they are have historically thrown labor at their problems because labor was so cheap now that labor’s becoming so much more expensive we’ve been able to help control our costs by taking some of our factory engineering skills and process skills to those factories so that they can get the kind of labor efficiency that we have in ours in our factories in mexico for example where we make a lot of our masschannel jeans the reason we have those factories is we can’t buy those products cheaper anywhere in the world we’ve tried but those factories are so finetuned that they produce goods at a lower price than any factory in any place in the world and that’s why they’re part of the family rl according to your annual report vf corporation is the only apparel company to engage mit’s media lab in search of innovation what is your philosophy on looking outside for innovation ew we are working really hard on a robust innovation platform around vf to touch every part of the business and as a result of that we’ve gone outside the industry to partner with clever people who are doing things that may not be relevant to the apparel industry so we are the sole apparel partner of the mit media lab there’s a lot of times incredibly smart people in places like mit are working on inventions but they don’t always know what their practical use is we’re trying to see how they could help us in some way it could be in a product for one of our factories for our global business technology group – it could be anywhere we also worked with robert redford and the sundance group with our brand people on storytelling we wanted to think about the next emotional level of marketing and it’s got to get better than a flyer in the sunday paper that says “come buy me at  off” there’s got to be a deeper emotional connection so who’s great at telling emotional stories the film industry and so we’ve been out to hollywood and worked with directors and actors and with sundance on how to tell a really rich story how do you grab somebody by the heart and attract them to you rl can you talk more about innovation ew north face is launching a new performance technology this year called flash dry it’s a midlayer piece that wicks moisture away from you and it dries in a flash that’s kind of how it got named we’ve worked with professional lighting people on how you bring this tech story to life with really clever lighting we had our retail store people go to to learn what might work in their stores another example is our work on waterrepellent fabrics in india with our jeans business most of the people in india get around on scooters bicycles and motorcycles and there’s a funny little season there called the monsoon season if you’ve ever worn a pair of wet jeans they’re just not comfortable to be in so we’ve launched a pair of jeans that flat out don’t get wet you can pour gallons of water on them and it is repelled immediately rl finally what are vf’s major weaknesses and threats ew i think the threat is how do we stay nimble and innovative at the brand level while the brands are part of such a large corporation that’s something that we have to work at or we risk destroying the entrepreneurial spirit that built these businesses we work really hard at letting the brands run their businesses and interfere with them as little as possible so that they can achieve their own destinies all our brands

mexico and central america our international jeanswear businesses operate manufacturing facilities located in poland turkey and malta for these owned production plants we purchase raw materials from numerous domestic and international suppliers for scheduled production  no single supplier represents more than  of our total cost of sales over the last several years vf has shifted production from the united states to lower cost locations as a result of this shift in sourcing approximately  of our domestic net sales in  were manufactured in vfowned facilities primarily in mexico and central america and  were obtained from contractors primarily in asia similarly european jeanswear sourcing has been shifting from owned plants in western europe to lower cost owned production outside of western europe and contracted production in the middle east africa and asia to an increasing extent we are using independent contractors who own the raw materials and ship only finished readyforsale products to vf these contractors are engaged through vf sourcing hubs in hong kong and miami these hubs are responsible for product procurement product quality assurance and supplier management and handling functions in the eastern and western hemispheres respectively all products in the outdoor and sportswear coalitions as well as a growing portion of product requirements for our other coalitions are obtained through these sourcing hubsthe current sourcing strategy for products sold in the united states allows us to balance our needs with a mix of vfowned and contracted production in the western hemisphere combined with contracted production primarily from asia owned production generally has a lower cost than contracted production overall product obtained from the western hemisphere has somewhat higher cost but gives us greater flexibility shorter lead times and lower inventory levels as compared with production obtained from the far east and other more distant resources this combination of vfowned and contracted production along with different geographic regions and cost structures provides a balanced approach to product sourcing  k  competitors gap inc

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
