the net proceeds received from us and from the concurrent private placement to fund our development activities and for other general corporate purposes we compete with other residential retail and commercial property developers in the development of properties in the northern and southern california markets significant factors which we believe allow us to compete effectively in this business include • the size and scope of our mixeduse masterplanned communities • the recreational and cultural amenities available within our communities • the commercial centers in our communities • our relationships with homebuilders and • the proximity to major metropolitan areas company description we are the largest owner and developer of mixeduse masterplanned communities in coastal california based on the total number of residential homesites permitted to be built under existing entitled zoning our three existing communities have the general plan and zoning approvals necessary for the construction of thousands of homesites and millions of square feet of commercial space and represent a significant portion of the real estate available for development in three of the most dynamic and supply constrained markets along the california coast—los angeles county san francisco county and orange county these markets exhibit strong longterm housing demand fundamentals including population and employment growth coupled with constrained supply of residential land as a result of entitlement challenges and land availability our three communities reflect  years of strategic positioning stemming from the assets acquired during the tenure of emile haddad our chairman and chief executive officer when he served as chief investment officer of lennar one of the nation’s largest homebuilders we are developing new vibrant and sustainable communities that in addition to homesites include commercial retail educational and recreational elements as well as civic areas parks and

exempt the san francisco shipyard and candlestick point from restrictions on new office development applicable to all other projects citywide in  we intend to seek approval from governmental authorities to increase total commercial space including retail hotels artists’ studios maker space community uses and schools in this community from approximately  million square feet to approximately  million square feet • great park neighborhoods great park neighborhoods consists of approximately  acres in orange county california and is being built around the approximately  acre
