through joint ventures on this episode he explains what jv partners are and how you can utilize them so you can build your business and create more income without spending money on ads to attract leads key takeaways a joint venture is an arrangement of mutual benefit between two or more people of businesses and who have complementary resources joint venturing means you can get access to anything you want by just partnering with other people who have complementary resources starting to create joint ventures partnership the first step is determining your target market and knowing where these people are find the influencer who controls that market who can give you access to that marketplace people spend money on paid ads to generate leads but most of those leads are unconverted there is a big opportunity right now to do joint ventures by accessing unconverted leads you can do a partnership with companies to offer your product or services to their unconverted leads things to look for when looking for a joint venture is the joint venture partner you’re approaching complimentary to your business there has to be three wins for your joint partner for you and for the customers once you start understanding how joint ventures and strategic alliances work you see joint venture opportunities everywhere wherever you go three sides to a joint venture working with someone who has a big list people with products arbitrage if you’re a coach or a consultant and you have existing clients you can do joint ventures between existing clients when you go to an event there are only two questions you need to ask people the first is an icebreaker question “how did you get started as a whatever they are” the next question is “how can i help you grow your business” transcription jv partners – sohail khan kamala chambers welcome to training tuesday we’re going to be talking about how to build your business and create more income just through relationships that doesn’t mean spending money on advertising or anything just through relationships called “jv partners” or “joint venture partnerships” so get ready to launch everyone today we have sohail khan on the show he is the world’s premier jv partners expert and the founder of the million dollar partnering system he’s a speaker a coach an author and he works with corporate businesses and educational establishments worldwide this guy runs figure businesses he knows his stuff we got the best here to talk about jv partners luis congdon all right thriving launchers we are here with sohail khan i’m excited to have you on the show today sohail are you ready to launch sohail khan yes luis congdon awesome it’s great to have you one of the things that inspire me about you is i listened to your story and you do that stuff called “jv partners” or joint ventures some people over at thriving launch know what that means and some of you don’t i first want to start off today’s interview what are jv partners why does it matter and who can use something like jv partners sohail khan okay jv partners are an arrangement of mutual benefit between two or more people of businesses and who have complementary resources what that means is that you can partner up with anyone or you can get access to anything you want any resource you want any product or any asset by just partnering with other people who have complementary resources i’ll give an example examples of jv partners sohail khan let’s say you are a dating coach or a relationship coach in the marketplace and you created a program that you want to get out there to other people partnering with a dating newsletter that has access to those resources that you need which are pretty much the audience is an easier surefire way and a targeted way to get access to all of those customers sometimes there’s even no cost upfront jv partners beat other kinds of advertising and the targeting is just  pure because you’re targeting those resources or those customers that you’re after jv partners allow people to reduce the advertising cost down to zero by just going out there and partnering with other people who have access to those resources that we need kamala chambers what do you say is the first step to start creating jv partners sohail khan i think the first thing you have to determine is your core target market where are the people customers and clients that you are trying to target so once you’ve defined a target market and you know exactly where these people are then you can go ahead and find the influencer or the president who controls that market who can give you access to that marketplace luis congdon i want to do a recap briefly for you guys what sohail said and maybe you already got it jv partners are when you team up with someone else that could and can help you leverage your offer your service or your product that you’re offering let’s say you’re a yoga teacher maybe you’ll team up with a company that sells yoga mats and you sell their yoga mats and they pay you per every sale that’s jv partners or maybe they sell the yoga mats and include with that is one of your dvds which helps you get a cut what are jv partners luis congdon it’s when you partner up with someone else in your marketplace or even in different markets that are synergistic so that then you can get your name and brand out there further did i explain that properly sohail khan yes i think it goes far beyond that the biggest opportunity right now out there is everyone is spending money on paid ads like google ads and facebook ads people are generating leads and they’re paying for leads the biggest thing is that most of those leads aren’t being converted those individuals who come to that company or individual don’t exactly want that product there is a big opportunity right now to do jv partners by accessing unconverted leads for companies who can’t convert their products their services and do the partnership with them to offer your product or service to them to those unconverted leads so it goes far beyond that the premise people think of jv partners as “you mail for me i’ll mail for you you do a mailing to my list i’ll do a mailing to your list” but it goes ten times beyond that luis congdon that’s fantastic i know in my business when we’ve had email drops or we’ve made jv partners with other people it’s incredible over here at thriving launch we’ve just skimmed the surface and this is why we’ve brought you here i’ve had email drops from people like todd brown one of the greatest marketing minds out there when he emailed for us and we partnered up in that way it added a lot of new leads and conversions over to our site it was fantastic we’ve brought you on today to talk a little bit how to go deeper with that what to look for in jv partners luis congdon what’s one of the first things we should look for when we’re looking for jv partners sohail khan i trained jv partners and brokers around the world what we do is we have a jv partners checklist that we go through the first question we ask is “is the jv partners that you’re approaching complementary to your own business” because they have to have some synergy for example a bicycle tire had approached a food manufacturer they expect them to sell their bike tires to their customers it doesn’t work so i think the complementary aspect has to be there first you have to look and see what sort of synergy there is and it has to be three wins sohail khan that is the first aspect to look at when you’re going out there looking for jv partners i talk a lot about something called “the jv partners mindset” once you start understanding how joint ventures and jv partners and strategic alliances work it’s absolute phenomenal because it opens your mind degree view and you see jv partners opportunities everywhere wherever you go i’ve built most of my businesses seven figures and  figure businesses on the back of jv partners and strategic alliances i’ve hardly spent any money on any paid advertising that’s how powerful it is kamala chambers i loved how you’ve framed this and made it so digestible for us i know it’s a huge topic say you have a company you feel is synergistic the markets matched up what would you do then what’s your next step how would you reach out  sides to a jv partners sohail khan the next step always is to have a conversation with any jv partners you’re looking to team up with but it has to be something that is an advantage to them also you just can’t approach people and say “i’ve got this great product i think you should sell it because i think it’s a great product” there are three different sides to jv partners  jv partners with a big list sohail khan we only work with someone who has a big list we would approach that customer and say “we can help you maximize your revenue from making more money from existing customers” i’m responsible for this myself because i’ve done it in the past i spent a lot of money acquiring new clients and on lead generation but i don’t realize that they’re missing out on their existing customers so that’s where jv partners can be of benefit if you’re approaching someone per se “we have a great product these are the conversion rates there are the testimonials we think that this product will highly benefit your current customers and will help you maximize and acquire an additional income from providing that to existing customers so you can have an ongoing initial revenue stream” jv partners with products sohail khan  we have people approach us with products for example i’ve got this great product again you go through the checklist what is the product is it a digital product is it a physical product what are the mechanisms behind delivery is it easy to deliver we’ve got loads of factors conversions rates the product product cost testimonials from that we’ll find a distribution channel for them which will be your jv partner now approaching the jv partner is something that you need to target first of all you need to understand that this is a product that will profoundly benefit the jv partner’s customers jv partners with unconverted leads sohail khan  the arbitrage this means approaching companies that have unconverted leads that we can use to partner other products to get sales so then get a return on their investment on the leads and also we can split the profits i’ll give you a good explanation of how to find the perfect jv partners let’s use the example of widgets so you’ve got a widget the widget is what you sell now what you need to define and write down is when a customer to you and buys that widget what do they buy before and after they bought that widget from you those are your jv partners whatever product customers will purchase before and after they buy your product those are the ideal jv partners you need to find luis congdon that’s very smart and it makes me think of a video that i watched with dan kennedy for all of the thriving launchers listening if you haven’t heard of dan kennedy make sure to go to youtube and look up dan kennedy because he’s one of the greatest marketing minds to have ever lived he’s a fantastic marketer and understands marketing one of the things he talks about is the price to acquire a new client is a lot more than to keep that customer so once you get that client and you have a client you can make more a lot more sales to them especially once you’ve made one or two sales to somebody you can keep selling them more stuff who jv partners can work with luis congdon the other thing he talks about is a lot of people miss out on the value of current clients because they’re not thinking about the process of their customers once a client has bought one or two things their likelihood of buying more stuff increases and so we do need to offer our current customers other things that will help make their lives easier in whatever process that we’re offering even better i’m curious does jv partners or jving work for any industry or are there industries that this doesn’t work let’s say you’re a coach or a consultant or an expert can it work sohail khan yes most definitely because if you look at a coach or a consultant and you have existing clients you can do jv partners between existing clients and you can go out and find jv partners for existing clients let me give you a background i run a threeday program certifying jv partners now when i first offered the program many years ago we had a lot of people coming on the program who are looking for a business opportunity they had money to invest they want to change their career and they want to do something entirely different fast forward to the last couple of years i’m having more consultants and coaches coming on the program because they want to have an additional revenue stream and then i had to broke joint ventures for their clients so yes it does work and it does work for coaches and consultants as well kamala chambers what’s one of your number one tips you’d recommend that you haven’t already mentioned i know you already had many good ones jv partners cut your costs in acquiring new customers sohail khan that’s a good question when luis was talking about the dan kennedy principle and this is what i teach a lot in my programs and with my clients here are the figures it cost six times as much to sell to a new buyer because that is the actual cost of acquiring a new customer but once you’ve had that client selling to the same customer cost you nothing here’s the interesting thing if you get a jv partner to do the marketing for you and you acquire customer or clients it costs you zero there’s no lead generation cost because someone else already has the marketing machine in place and it’s generating those sales and those customers will come to you that is how great joint ventures are kamala chambers before we close out the interview is there any real message you want to leave people with about things they could go out and do today to start applying some of this things sohail khan yes the first thing that you need to be looking at is what synergies exist already in your own business and also looking at connecting with other people i could give you a tip when you go to an event there are only two questions you need to ask people the first question is an icebreaker question for example let’s say i’ve seen peter at an event i’ll ask peter this question “peter how did you get started as a whatever they are” that question builds rapport then the next question after i would ask him is “so tell me peter how can i help you grow your business” and that’s the second question you would ask from that you find out exactly what people need when you go to events instead of pitching people jv partners is the ultimate marketing strategy sohail khan this is the one i teach all my brokers and consultants and i do this myself i’ve got a few of my brokers and consultants at some big events right now and that’s all we do go out there make as many connections as you can talk to as many people and bear in mind what you’re looking for as well on the jv partner side you can substantially triple or quadruple your business without spending any money i learned this from reading jay abraham‘s book many years ago which is getting everything you can out of all you’ve got and then he became my mentor in  if you look up the on the internet and you search anywhere that’s all i do all i talk about is joint ventures and strategic mindset is because i love it kamala chambers luis i know that this is something that you’re good at it what i see you do is just exactly what we’ve been talking about here it’s about creating a connection with people first first and foremost is about looking for ways to serve others and create relationships just curious if there’s anything else that you want to add to that luis congdon well i think we touched on a lot of great points there that question asking people “what can i do to help your business” is a fantastic way to generate learning more about the person’s business and also learn about what’s going on in that person’s business and then it’s a way for you to extract relevant information to see if there’s a synergy there finding jv partners by giving value luis congdon i think that’s a great question and by asking these you also come off as a person who is interested in providing value and not somebody who’s going just to take i thought that those were two fantastic questions to use sohail khan thank you luis congdon thank you so much for coming on the show today we appreciate you breaking down for us exactly what a jv is because i think a lot of people need to start utilizing that more often businesses anything that’s big in life any big success requires other people that’s exactly why i wanted to have you on the show today because a lot of individuals aren’t utilizing the resources that are around them and jving is a resource that i think a lot of individuals need to start jumping on today thank you so much for joining us here on thriving launch sohail khan thank you for having
