have searched for about  years for a boot to go over my shoes for the winter months in wisconsin and came up with nothing that worked because of falling arches and tarsal tunnel in my feet i love my boots they fit very nice and are not clumsy or bulky they slide on great and are very comfortable i can finally go out in the bad weather  not wreck my shoes or inserts  and they look like regular boots keep up the good work one happy customer mary from sussex wi overshoes in action click here to read about neos overshoes going on an outdoor photography adventure     about us contact us
