are diagnosed with lumbar disc degeneration a lower spine condition that can cause chronic back pain this patient guide is intended to provide you with a better understanding of lumbar disc replacement as well as introduce you to the m®l artificial lumbar disc a novel and unique technology used to treat these painful degenerative lumbar conditions this guide is not intended as a substitute for an informed discussion with your physician please choose a topic   the lumbar spine lumbar disc degeneration ddd treating lumbar disc degeneration glossary of terms glossary of terms ml procedure the lumbar spine what is the lumbar spine the lumbar spine is a complex system of bones muscles cartilage and nerves designed to support the weight of the upper body while allowing movement in multiple directions the low back officially begins with the lumbar region of the spine directly below the cervical and thoracic regions and directly above the sacrum the lumbar spine consists of five vertebrae called l through l the lumbar intervertebral disc between each vertebra is a disc a shockabsorbing pillow that helps maintain proper spacing stability and motion within the lumbar spine each disc has a fibrous tirelike outer band called the annulus fibrosus that encases a central gellike substance called the nucleus pulposus the nucleus and annulus work together to absorb shock help stabilize the spine and provide a controlled range of motion between each vertebra lumbar disc degeneration ddd as we age the discs in our lumbar spine begin to flatten and wear down when a disc flattens it forces the vertebrae closer together which can put added stress not only on the disc itself but also on the surrounding joints muscles and nerves this process is called lumbar disc degeneration and can lead to several painful conditions treating lumbar disc degeneration current treatment options for most patients nonsurgical or conservative treatments will effectively relieve symptoms of lumbar disc degeneration these treatments may include a combination of rest physical therapy or the use of painkillers or antiinflammatory medications if pain persists despite these treatments surgical treatment options may be considered your doctor will review the various treatment options available so that you can make an informed decision fusion the most common surgical procedure for treating lumbar disc degeneration is spinal fusion which removes the degenerated painful disc and replaces it with a bone graft over time the bone graft will unite with the vertebra above and below the disc space thus “fusing” the two vertebrae together to form a single column of bone the goal of spinal fusion is to eliminate pain by eliminating motion between the two vertebrae and restore proper spacing between them thus fusion may reduce or eliminate chronic low back pain however because it also eliminates the motion and shock absorption at that segment the adjacent segments are subject to increased stress which may lead to more rapid degeneration a condition known as adjacent level degeneration artificial lumbar disc replacement artificial disc replacement has been developed as an alternative to fusion once the damaged disc is removed it is replaced by an artificial disc the artificial disc is designed to restore proper spacing between the vertebrae while preserving motion associated with a healthy disc this motion may eliminate the occurrence of adjacent level degeneration ml procedure what happens during surgery during the disc replacement surgery you will be lying on your back and the surgeon will operate on your spine through an incision near the belly button the damaged disc is removed discectomy and the ml lumbar disc is then inserted into the disc space using specialized and precise instruments after the ml is successfully placed the incision is closed what can i expect after surgery after surgery your doctor will give you guidelines for activities and follow up requirements before you leave the hospital you may undergo therapy to help heal and strengthen your lumbar spine followup examinations are performed after surgery with your physician to assess your recovery lumbar spine extending backwards lumbar spine in neutral position lumbar spine flexing forward glossary of terms adjacent level degeneration condition resulting from treatment at one level leading to increased stress which may lead to more rapid degeneration at adjacent segments annulus fibrosus the fibrous tirelike outer band of a natural disc that encases the central gellike substance called the nucleus pulposus artificial disc a lumbar prosthesis that is inserted between vertebral bodies after a degenerated disc is removed the artificial disc is designed to maintain disc height as well as facilitate motion at the treated vertebral level discectomy the removal of part or the entire intervertebral disc fusion removal of the degenerated painful disc and replacement with a bone graft over time the bone graft will unite with the vertebra above and below the disc space thus “fusing” the two vertebrae together to form a single column of bone
