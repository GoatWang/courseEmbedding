delivers letter to board of directors of home loan servicing solutions ltd urging termination of hlsss relationship with ocwen loan servicing llc outlines hlsss opportunity to generate significant value for shareholders by forcing servicing transfers away from ocwenannounces intention to nominate a slate of directors to the hlss board for election at the companys  annual meeting feb    et from mangrove partners new york feb   prnewswire  the mangrove partners master fund ltd a significant shareholder of home loan servicing solutions ltd nasdaq hlss today announced it has delivered a letter to the members of hlsss board of directors the full text of the letter follows and has been posted to wwwfreehlsscom the board of directors home loan servicing solutions ltd co intertrust corporate services cayman limited  elgin avenue george town grand cayman ky cayman islands cc  michael lubin corporate secretary dear members of the board we are writing you in response to your letter dated february   response based on the latest publicly available shareholdings list the mangrove partners master fund ltd mangrove partners is one of the ten largest shareholders of home loan servicing solutions ltd hlss or the company as we expressed in our february   letter we believe it is imperative for the company to exercise its contractual rights to terminate its relationship with ocwen loan servicing llc ocwen without delay we believe that continuing to expose hlss to ocwenrelated risks by leaving the ocwen relationship intact constitutes a dereliction of your duty to the company and a grave risk to all shareholders your response was inadequate as a result it is our intention to nominate a slate of replacement directors for election this year because time is not the companys friend and you as the board are showing no signs of taking concrete action to protect shareholders in this serious situation  we believe that there have been multiple termination events under the documents governing hlsss purchase of rights to msrs rmsrs from ocwen pursuant to each sale supplement governing hlsss purchase of rmsrs from ocwen a termination event is defined as the occurrence of any one or more of the following events…e seller ocwen fails to maintain residential primary servicer ratings for subprime loans of at least average by standard  poors rating services…sq by moodys investors service inc moodys…and rps and rss by fitch ratings a termination event therefore occurred on january   when moodys downgraded ocwens servicer quality sq assessments to sq from sq and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to sq from sq another termination event occurred on february   when fitch ratings downgraded ocwens residential primary servicer rating for subprime product to rps from rps section  of the sales supplements specifies that in the case that any termination event occurs with respect to any servicing agreement… ocwen shall upon hlsss written direction to such effect use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer the servicing rights relating to any affected servicing agreement to a third party servicer identified by hlss importantly section  of the sales supplements then proceeds to state that hlss shall be entitled to receive all proceeds of such transfer emphasis added we believe that there are compelling reasons why hlss should immediately begin the process of exercising its rights to direct ocwen to transfer the servicing rights to one or more different servicers most importantly servicing transfers will isolate hlss from the risks of an ongoing relationship with ocwen a number of these risks were outlined in our prior letter to you you are no doubt aware that moodys downgraded hlsss corporate family rating from ba to b on october   citing hlsss reliance on ocwen as the primary reason for the downgrade additionally we remind you that the california department of business oversight threatened to suspend ocwens servicing license multiple times during  it is our belief that hlsss continued affiliation with ocwen is an unacceptable risk and contrary to the best interests of the company and its shareholders we believe that restructuring hlsss servicing counterparty relationships would be a significant positive development for the company in the current operating environment and would be viewed positively by all of the companys lending relationships transferring servicing would give hlss the opportunity to engage with servicers that have greater servicing stability better management oversight stronger relationships with regulators and higher ratings in addition to shielding hlss shareholders from ocwenrelated risks we believe that a transfer of the servicing rights will create significant value for hlss and its shareholders while our valuation work shows a range of potential values we believe that a reasonable estimate of the value created by transferring the servicing rights would be between  and  per share of incremental value to hlss  based on the companys book value on september   this represents an increase in book value of between  and  in addition we believe the companys stock is currently trading at a discounted multiple due to the companys close ties to ocwen once the company ends its association with ocwen we see no reason why the company would not return to trading at its historic multiple of between  and  of book value in a reasonable scenario this would give shareholders a value of between  and  per share we have included our analysis of the value available to hlss with a servicing transfer in the appendix to this letter although you may be concerned that hlsss exercise of its rights to force servicing transfers could create further instability at ocwen mangrove partners believes that ocwens cash flows would only be affected after the servicing transfers are completed likewise while the servicing transfers away from ocwen would likely cause ocwen to turn lossmaking and give rise to multiple covenant breaches in ocwens credit facility pursuant to section a and b of the ocwen senior secured term loan facility agreement dated february   these breaches would occur only after substantially all servicing transfers requested by hlss had been completed as such any ensuing ocwen default would be irrelevant to hlss and the companys remaining exposure to ocwen would be de minimis we urge you to fulfill your fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the company by causing the company to exercise its contractual rights to force a transfer of the servicing rights in doing so the board can and should insulate hlss from further ocwen risk and create substantial value for the company and its shareholders your responses vague reassurances and legal boilerplate did nothing to ease mangrove partners increasing and justified concerns about the direction of the company to be clear we are not looking for you to make selective disclosure to us—we are looking for you to take prudent action to protect the company and shareholder interests accordingly until such time as the company announces it has entered into definitive agreements to transfer the servicing rights away from ocwen pursuant to competitive processes conducted by toptier advisors it is our intention to bring new leadership to the board by nominating a highly qualified slate of directors this week sincerely nathaniel august president and portfolio manager mangrove partners valuation appendix  ocwen profits as servicer on msrs for which hlss funds advances ocwen acts as

indicated it believes ocwen earns on this relationship on june   hlss indicated in a lender presentation that ocwen earns a contribution profit of  bps of upb as servicer on hlss rmsrs as shown below

estimate that we will execute approximately  billion of calls over the next two years and they could be worth two to three points of profit to ocwen since these clean up call rights belong to the

were inthemoney as of december   altisource portfolio solutions sa asps profits from ocwens nonagency portfolio in january  asps provided estimates of potential technology and mortgage services pretax income it expects to generate from ocwens existing nongse portfolio we believe that substantially all of this pretax income is generated from ocwens nonagency portfolio hlss owns the rmsrs to over  of ocwens nonagency servicing portfolio a third party servicer to which hlss transfers servicing could derive significant value from performing the services that asps is currently performing and we believe that hlss could be compensated for this in the sale price of the servicing rights our estimate of the value another servicer could realize from the cash flows that asps forecast in its recent
