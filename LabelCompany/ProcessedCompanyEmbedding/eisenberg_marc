financial information we will discuss includes nongaap financial measures a reconciliation of these nongaap measures to gaap measures is included in our press release at this point ill turn the call over to marc eisenberg marc j eisenberg thanks michelle well we’re off to a fast start in  with a record quarter even though first quarters of the year tend to be soft we’ve got a lot of topics to cover on this call including an update on market conditions the progress weve made on some of our largest deployments to date including jb hunt and our partnership with att supporting the us postal service some exciting new customers and projects in key areas of the business as well the debt financing that we closed just a couple of weeks ago at that point ill turn the call to robert to walk you through the q financials and wrap up with qa so lets get started earlier this morning we issued a press release announcing financial results for the first quarter ended march   in q we reached a record  million in total revenues increasing over  or  million compared to the same period last year growth came from both service and hardware as we generated service revenues of  million a  yearoveryear increase and product sales of  million or  increase both record achievements the increased revenue performance resulted in significantly improved adjusted ebitda yearoveryear of  million an increase of nearly  or  million demonstrating the leverage in our model our subscriber count our subs grew in the quarter by over  net subs taking our base to  million at the end of march  a  increase yearoveryear we shipped a new high of about  devices across our various product lines some of which came from q  backlog while the first quarter was aided by deployments we had anticipated in  we are experiencing increasing demands helped by the seasonally strong second quarter we are expecting  to be a defining year backed by a strong sales pipeline and healthy backlog two small points in the quarter first hardware margins were lowered by startup costs associated with the onset of deployments for our new large customers to hit the time requirements for these projects second even though service revenues were greatly improved over last year professional fees were down approximately  which offset larger increases in recurring services looking at market conditions impacting the business heavy equipment is running at conservative but improving levels and oems are guiding to improved sales in the second half of the year we continue to be excited about our new heavy equipment oem who ordered over  million in products in q which i will talk about in more detail in a few moments rail companies are struggling based on the cost of fuel however we continue to see a migration toward iot technology as part of their core strategy is to reduce cost and add efficiencies in refrigerated trucking fleet owners need to be compliant with the fdas food safety modernization act or fsma regulatory requirements which is opening up multiple opportunities for our solutions we deployed our cold chain solution in one of the largest supermarket chains in the country wakefern food corporation which operates supermarkets under the shoprite fresh grocer price rite and dearborn market brands were seeing significant improvements in foreign geographies that have been struggling recently our customers in south america have again started taking hardware shipments in reasonable quantities overall this is the first time in quite a while that nearly every facet of our business is showing strength all at the same time we still have some concern as we continue to scale production we are building on new factory lines at unprecedented volumes but we believe we’ve got a good handle on it as long as macro conditions remain stable we believe we will continue to perform and execute on a really productive  to be clear hardware sales can be lumpy and i make a point to say that in up quarters and down quarters as well but over the course of  were expecting strong hardware sales as well before i move on to the business highlights id like you to  id like to discuss the thinking around our recent financing we secured  million in the highyield markets to replace our term loan and add additional growth capital first it enabled us to lock in  million at a fixed rate for the next  years our  million term loan was at a lower rate but an adjustable rate in a rising interest rate environment even though we had some more time in our existing loan wed have likely started renegotiating over the next year at a higher rate and we are not interested in raising equity or convertible debt to today’s share price levels second we needed to choose a platform that enables the company to scale with the business and not subject ourselves to large fees as we refinance our debt the highyield platform allows us to add incremental capital while keeping the current debt in place lastly it allows us to take advantage of a number of market opportunities including potential accretive acquisitions that will enable us to distribute more products to our customer base while adding incremental vertical markets and capabilities going into the highyield markets makes us more agile and we believe it will generate significant cost advantages over time while giving us more certainty we are currently analyzing a number of ma opportunities and while each one is unique you will probably not see an acquisition overly large in which deals have become increasingly competitive or excessively small which is difficult to move the needle while creating as much integration effort as in larger companies we are focusing on midsized targets that will add incremental vertical markets that are subscale and would benefit from significant orbcomms synergies its been a really productive quarter for our transportation group with a number of hardware shipments led by two of the largest deployments in the companys history jb hunt and att in support of the us postal service to recap jb hunt and orbcomm are ramping up for a deployment on nearly their entire fleet of more than  assets over the next year or so the solution features our new lte product on our gt  with cargo center that can be installed outside of the asset in under  minutes that allows for installation on a loaded trailer or container lets begin with the hardware shipments we shipped jb hunt nearly  systems through q and received a blanket purchase order for an additional  units which we intend to ship the vast majority this year transitioning to installations with one of the largest support teams in the iot industry at orbcomm including customer service deal technicians and installation training specialists we believe that we will be able to assist them in completing their deployment in record time this is an aggressive installation plan and once we outfit a good portion of jb hunts fleet installations may slow a bit as it becomes more challenging to catch large pools of containers available for installation which is typical for deployments of this size in other words based on the speed of installations service revenues will likely trail hardware shipments and subscriber adds by a quarter or two while the goal is to complete the fleetwide deployment by the end of  we wouldn’t be surprised if installations extended into next year jb hunt is a technology leader with one of the largest fleets in north america and we’re really excited about this partnership we look forward to jb hunt seeing the vast benefits and efficiency and endtoend visibility in our logistics chain with our asset monitoring solution on our last call we announced that our partner att won a large contract with us postal service concurrent with the jb hunt announcement but i wanted to go into more detail as its one of our largest deals to date the us postal service has access to tens of thousands of trailer assets across a vast number of different suppliers and we are helping to monitor them on a unified platform for logistical efficiencies as well as visibility and security of their fleet in q we shipped  units to the postal service for their own fleet as well as an additional  to one of their major leasing suppliers we expect to ship over  units in q to additional leasing company suppliers and we will continue to shift to their highway route contractors over time given the size and widespread distribution of the postal services trailer fleets our solution and partnership with att is a great fit for meeting their complex requirements and seamlessly connecting their device network of assets  im sorry diverse network of assets another great win for the orbcomm att partnership in q many of our longstanding transportation customers continued to place renewal orders such as walmart hub celadon kllm werner john christner trucking light speed swift cr england meyer summitt trucking and snl distribution industries carrier also placed additional orders as they continue to prepare for the official launch of their telematics program in north america weve closed several new opportunities this quarter including wakefern which i mentioned earlier wakeferns selection of our cold chain solution was largely driven by our high quality products and the need to be compliant with fsma legislation in addition our european subsidiary is supporting a new container opportunity with the german shipping line deutsche afrikalinien or dal the dal opportunity is a great example of how our various business units crosssell our iot portfolio euroscan is providing dal with our reeferconnect solution including hardware and web platform from our containers and port solutions or caps business to monitor their container shipments from europe to africa and back which will begin shipping in q were also seeing crossselling success with our latest acquisition orbcomm africa who was selected by south africas department of fisheries and forestry to provide a custom solution that utilizes idp products along with our proprietary fleet management platform for their fishing vessel monitoring solution we believe there is no better evidence that our strategy is working when seeing various components and skill sets we obtained through our  acquisitions or products we build internally come together to deliver one cohesive solution for our customer within our government business our partner kevadiya recently renewed their multiyear contract with the department of veterans affairs vetride program this project is another great example of how were leveraging a number of technologies across different platforms this solution utilizes orbcomms dualmode idp and cellular device with a tablet installed on va passenger shuttle buses and vans in combination with a sophisticated web platform developed by kevadiya vetride is used by transportation coordinators at va medical centers to schedule dispatch and optimize transportation services for patient appointments we’ve also teamed with kevadiya on a new product with the federal bureau of prisons to monitor their buses orbcomm is providing satellite communication services and hardware in support of kevadiyas fleet mobility solution this solution will enable the federal bureau of prisons to gain full visibility of their fleet optimizing routing and take immediate action in case of emergency our application enablement platform or iapp group also had some key wins during q we’ve added glencore one of the worlds largest mining companies to our customer portfolio glencore will use the iapp based asset watch solution in conjunction with rfid technology for monitoring highvalue underground heavy equipment vehicles initially at two mines in canada this realtime solution is planned to be expanded to include mine workers and additional vehicle types in the future and is expected to be deployed at other locations throughout canada we also grew our enterprise software opportunity with iron mountain enabling them to expand their deployments to well over  warehouse sites around the world orbcomms solution helps iron mountains customers gain access to unsurpassed levels of stored records visibility auditing and validation capabilities we are excited about the momentum in this business and hope to be able to report on additional wins in the future in heavy equipment we shipped our most significant order of our new heavy equipment monitoring device totaling nearly  million to our new oem as a reminder we’re providing this oem with an endtoend telematic solution for their global customers which has options for og satellite service cellular connectivity or a combination of both along with our fleetedge web reporting platform they have already started deployments throughout north america and we expect europe to follow shortly as i mentioned on our last call we expect to be able to announce this relationship more formally sometime in q and are excited about the opportunity to support the build out of their telematics program turning to ais q was a record quarter with  million in revenue and we are seeing solid momentum in the business on our last call we announced two major multiyear contracts with the government of canada through our canadian partner maerospace as well as the australian maritime safety authority or amsa through our partner kordia weve already started providing our ais data to both organizations in march we introduced an exciting new product called hali that combines terrestrial and satellite ais data capability along with orbcomms twoway satellite endtoend technology to deliver reliable vessel location data and ensure safety security and compliance for small class b vessels such as pleasure craft and fishing vessels currently hali is the only solution in the market that provides multimode connectivity adding twoway capability which is available only through orbcomm lets transition to an update on our satellite network we recently crossed the oneyear mark of offering commercial service in the final mission of og satellites we are in the process of performing propulsion maneuvers to position the og satellites to their final operational orbits three of the four satellite planes have reached their targeted position or are in the process of being thrust into their final altitude the last plane is scheduled to reach its final orbit in early q of  as the planes continue to separate the networks messaging performance will gradually continue to improve currently the og satellites process about  of the networks total message traffic summing up its difficult to express how many projects we take on and how talented and hard working the team is at orbcomm they’ve been able to keep up an incredible pace quarterafterquarter launching satellites as well as their evolving services refinancing the company supporting large deployments developing new products collaborating with new partners integrating acquired companies expand the capabilities servicing current customers adding new features reducing costs we constantly strive to make ourselves better i dont thank our roughly  employees enough thanks to them we’re prepared for growth and we continue to take on more opportunities we remain focused on execution and believe our most significant asset and differentiator continues to be our ability to provide the broadest set of capabilities technologies products and services i don’t believe anyone else in our markets can compare at this point ill turn the call over to robert to take you through the financials robert g costantini thank you marc good morning everyone first i will provide some insights regarding our financial performance in the first quarter and then followup highlevel discussion on the recent debt raise that closed in early april for the first quarter of  total revenues reached  million with both service revenues and product sales achieving record levels subscriber net additions were over  in the quarter these measures translated to a robust first quarter sustained by a strong backlog heading into the second quarter service revenues of  million grew about  yearoveryear with service revenues contribution margin expanding about  basis points to approximately  signaling consistent solid performance from incremental revenues over the last year  over last year product sales of  million grew by approximately  compared to last year supported by the q backlog that’s shifting q this year contribution margins totaled of  for total revenues of  were impacted by the mix of service revenues and product sales in the quarter as well as higher volume of large size orders of product shipment in terms of profitability we generated  million of adjusted ebitda up nearly  from the year earlier period at a margin of  of total revenue service revenues came in at  million up nearly  from the prioryear period the growth in service revenues was led by the transportation ais and marine groups and was largely driven by growth in the recurring service revenue subscriber base as compared to last year that included a higher amount of professional service revenue ais revenues were particularly strong in q and are now at  million per quarter trending at nearly  million on an annual run rate record first quarter product sales of  million were up by about  over q last year with strength in both domestic and international markets we shipped a record  devices in the first quarter this quarter benefited from a backlog push from q and we are entering q with an even greater backlog net subscribers added in q were over  our total subscriber  billable subscriber base grew to  million at march  a  increase over the  million at the end of march last year looking at direct contribution margins service revenues net of direct cost of service for q were  of total service revenues improving sequentially and  basis points higher than the prioryear quarter product sales net of direct cost of products in q were at  of total product sales reflecting higher production and delivery costs on the large size deals we opted for aggressive delivery of products to speed up service revenues over higher hardware margins leading to some manufacturing inefficiencies further compressing already lower margin sales we expect to smooth out these higher costs in the next quarter or two by leveraging the higher volumes and eliminating nonessential component cost in the manufacturing process in the first quarter of  the company had a net loss of  million compared to net loss of  million for the same period last year advancing the loss this year were  million in higher cost for depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense of  million and higher sga of  million sga expense grew by  yearoveryear below the  to  range in growth we guided to for  a benefit to the bottom line this quarter was lower product development cost by  million depreciation and amortization increased by  million in the first quarter to  million depreciation increased  million over q last year reflecting an incremental  months of expense related to mission  satellites that were offset by slightly lower amortization expense by  million for the second quarter of  we expect depreciation and amortization expense at the same level then growing by about  in both q and q of  interest expense for q  was  million versus  million in the prior year including the amortization of debt fees acquisition related and integration costs were  million in the first quarter of this year compared to  million in the same period last year that reflected the skygistics acquisition with the net proceeds from the debt raise earmarked for growth we expect acquisition related and integration activity to pick up for the remainder of  looking at the balance sheet cash totaled  million at march   compared to  million at december   a decrease of nearly  million the decrease reflects  million for capital expenditures partially offset by cash provided from operations in the quarter breaking down the capital expenditures further  million related to sustaining capex for existing infrastructure and approximately  million related to investment capex for new products and services our total debt outstanding at march st is  million net of debt issuance costs with an available  million undrawn revolving credit facility a few comments on the recent senior notes issuance with  and what our expectations are for the debt raise before i move into q guidance on april   orbcomm issued  million of  senior secured notes due in  in a private offering pursuant to an indenture agreement that was filed with the sec on form k the indenture agreement spells out the terms and conditions which the notes and the company will be subject to for the next  years the purpose of the raise was to repay our existing notes that were due in  as well as provide growth capital on an estimated pro forma basis at march   our cash balance was  million posttransaction and after the existing debt repayment the estimated leverage ratio posttransaction for debttoadjustedebitda as reported for the trailing  months ended march   was approximately  times on a prostep basis and  times on an net debt basis we intend to put that cash to work to grow the company and to grow adjusted ebitda to naturally deleverage the balance sheet strategically we thought it made sense to fix the rate of interest over the next  years in what has been a rising interest rate environment over that term we believe we will be financially beneficial structurally its a better vehicle to balance the capital structure as we continue to grow and to provide the maximum flexibility to support the growth plan now moving into q guidance we expect service revenues of about  million we are building products to support  million in orders and while we believe we will ship all  million in q about  million is scheduled to ship in late june a portion of which could slip into q we expect product contribution margins to stabilize in the  range for the year as a remainder  as a reminder rather for the fullyear of  we guided the service revenues between  million and  million with product sales ranging from a low of  million to a high of a  million we are confident that we should exceed the lowend of the range for both service revenues and product sales and will likely end up in the mid to the highend of the range for the year adjusted ebitda margin for  is expected to be in the  range as hardware ramp ups at an increasing pace wrapping up we ended the first quarter of  with strong momentum from an unprecedented backlog for product sales winning some of the largest opportunities in the marketplace that ultimately sustains longerterm service revenue growth we are entering q riding the same wave of momentum with the continued urgency to execute we are obviously delighted with the great start for  in q and we look forward to an even better year this now concludes our remarks for this call and we are happy to take your question questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from ric prentiss with raymond james ric prentiss good morning guys marc j eisenberg hey ric ric prentiss hey appreciate all that extra color first question is on the potential ma marc you mentioned that you’re analyzing a number of deals don’t look for anything too big or too small can you kind of help us understand what vertical markets might be interesting and is there any other areas like geographies or capabilities that might be included in that and then just kind of timing one having raised the debt how soon should we expect to see some of it put to work given that you’re going to have to carry the interest costs marc j eisenberg so ric historically once we raise our capital we put it to work over the next quarter or two so a portion of which  obviously we are not going to put  spot based on my comments but something relatively quickly in terms of the targets we’re looking at we’re zoned in right now on the united states where we’re seeing strength and where the power of the orbcomm distribution is really doing an awful lot of magic and in the nearterm we are going to stay  we are currently looking at opportunities its vertical markets in transportation because if you just look at that powerful start with reefer and add dry vans and then automatically have the distribution set up and then once we did that we were successful getting into the container business and the reefer container business and our hit rate and our success in on boarding those incremental american vertical markets has been  just been a great return for our shareholders so i think that’s what we are looking at for our first opportunity something like that ric prentiss okay and then some of the contracts you mentioned can you help us kind of size them obviously jb hunt is really large the post office is sizable as well but the new ones that were included in the press release and talked a little bit about today any of them stand out particularly strong as potential number of units that could help  marc j eisenberg you know they are all in that  to  unit mark and those are the cool deals that kind of sustain us in between these big super large deals but a lot of these are solution subs that we’ve been doing an awful lot of work so some of these might look like a  subs but they may have the economics of  subs so they are really large even though they don’t look really large but gee ric i’ve never quite seen anything just like this i mean we are clicking along and kind of knocking these out one after the other and some of these opportunities like glencore and iron mountain they are not subbased and there is very little hardware involved there so these are software solutions so they work their way into service revenues but there is no denominator there and that creates some of that volatility quartertoquarter in service revenues but gee  to close the deal that’s roughly  million in pure service is pretty good for orbcomm over the course of the year ric prentiss okay good margin definitely okay thanks guys marc j eisenberg okay ric operator and next we will hear from mike walkley with canaccord genuity marc j eisenberg mike mike walkley thanks guys nice start to the year on the strong hardware sales and outlook just going through the hardware gross margin i just want to clarify that you guided to kind of  versus the  is that just due to the expedited ramp of these new customers and then if that’s the case how should we think about the attachment to solution sales and maybe driving higher recurring revenue as they come online robert g costantini yes so that’s precisely at making those conscious tradeoffs between needing a faster delivery schedule precisely to get at those faster revenue stream so this is unprecedented in so many ways in terms of size and speed that  they are doing everything they can to get them installed as quickly as possible we are doing everything we can to make sure that the product is there for them to do that so again as for service revenues its going to take a quarter or two to get that scale going we expect those to come online as quickly as they can get installed marc j eisenberg so they have days that they were able to install almost a  units so i mean its going quickly and the hardware is actually slowing us down right now but that’s going to stop pretty soon just two points on your margin question number one the hardware margins in q were lower but we kind of ended up where we thought we would be in the  from an ebitda perspective because we made it up on higher volumes and when we guided to  for the rest of the quarter its partially because we’re carrying the  in the first quarter robert g costantini yes marc j eisenberg so you’ve got that start to the year and to  if you are kind of rolling in  to  for the rest of the year that will get to  but we  so we think it should rise as we get these oneoffs complete and the second point that i would make is when we gave our guidance of  million to  million we said gee if we are at the low end of that in the  million the margins could be higher than  and if we get to the higher end or over the  million mark we said the margins could be lower than that so basically we are kind of supporting what we said on the one hand we are saying gee now this hardware is looking like the higher end the mid to highend which is what we guided to today but the other half of that is the margins may be a point or two smaller so i think that’s exactly what you are seeing but in the end from my perspective if margin is  or  gee lets get a couple hundred thousand subscribers on the switch this year or even more a bigger number that the company has never seen before and lets get that recurring revenue on the switch and get the service moving and that’s really the companys goal mike walkley thanks that’s helpful marc and then just building on that with the  on the services revenue little slower sequential growth and sounds like that was mainly all due to the professional services does the professional services recover with some of these big installation or is that kind of headwind to your solutions business on a yearoveryear comparison basis robert g costantini no no we are guiding to  million there is probably going to be some in there its a timing thing so sometimes just depending on when those things hit when you either hit a milestone or something of that nature and of course we’re not talking about ais so its not sort of game over just because its a little bit lower in q it could rebound in later quarters so not a particular concern its just the explanation to what happened mike walkley okay great and last question for me and i will pass it on just update overall on the carrier business it sounds like its finally getting ready to go commercial can you maybe talk about how that deal is going and kind of your business you see both in europe and us with carrier and the different drivers there marc j eisenberg you know in the us carrier is fielding units on real customers now which is really really exciting gee i am going to just restrain myself from telling you the customers are but  because that’s their job to announce not mine but i think its going well they move a little slower than orbcomm does but that being said everyone moves slower than orbcomm does and they are a dow component they are going to be ready when they are ready but it feels like they are really really close to pulling the trigger united states is ahead of europe in that there is two completely different hardware products that go on the european units versus the american units so that one is lagging just a little bit behind if you think  the united states even though we have the fsma requirements there is an awful lot of logistics concerns and then the european is a whole lot more focused on compliance day one but just a quarter or two behind i think at one point carrier is going to put units in the factory on every unit i think its heading in that direction but i think the whole world is heading in that direction thats iot thats what were seeing out there and at that point carrier should be our largest customer or pretty close to it operator okay we will move on to our next caller  our question will come from mike malouf with craighallum capital group mike malouf great thanks for taking my questions marc j eisenberg hi mike mike malouf hi i have a question on capex if you could just  you did a little over  million for … marc j eisenberg yes mike malouf … the march quarter i’m wondering now with some of the acquisitions that you’ve could speed up is that growth capex changed at all for you or do you have a pretty good sense of projects for that or multiple speakers robert g costantini yes no no this is sort of in line i would say the timing of when you spend it especially on the growth side is  its variable quartertoquarter its not like a straight line the sustaining component is right on target so i would say the ma doesn’t really change that i mean when we go in and evaluate what those companies need a lot of times we can leverage something we already have don’t have any visibility into that at the moment so id say we are sort of on track here mike malouf okay and then with regards to ais i know that that’s popped up a little bit faster obviously indiscernible recently announced deal do you still feel that  million to  million is kind of the target for that eventually or is that maybe kind of move on a little bit better robert g costantini i mean we are tracking awfully well to what we’ve guided to and this has been a pretty consistent message from us for three years so i would say right now we are in that  million to  million total range but we are hoping we are wrong there we will see where it goes marc j eisenberg and any new products that we are building like this hali device that isnt in the  million to  million that is a different product that could be additive to it so i guess what we are saying is  million to  million is pure distribution of data you turn the indiscernible on and you start sending people raw data but any products that we can kind of evolve around that would be additive mike malouf great great and then just a final question cimc is there any kind of update with regards to the china opportunity indiscernible say marc j eisenberg you know i was kind of hoping to hold this but we got an email just after we would already worked through our script and everything and they are about to begin a  unit pilot with a customer and they are working through the contracts and maximizing their efficiency on their hardware so working through the technical aspects but gee i love pilots at the  range don’t you mike malouf indiscernible marc j eisenberg there has been some movement in china but when you get near that chinese new year work really stops but we continue to be excited by that opportunity mike malouf okay thanks a lot marc j eisenberg okay operator we will now hear from david gearhart with first analysis david gearhart good morning thanks for taking my question my first question is in the past you’ve given the pipeline number at a million units and just wondering if you could give us an update on the quantity of units that are in your pipeline and maybe just a highlevel sense of what the mix is versus trailer intermodal heavy equipment just how we should be thinking about pipeline marc j eisenberg yes the opportunities that we are looking at they are getting vastly bigger and gee its  the million that we were talking about we probably took down a huge chunk of it if you kind of look at hunt you look at what we are looking at i think in those days when i drew up that number we were looking at the carrier units out there and we were looking at some of the business stuff and this pipeline is generating  units last quarter in hardware just on a quarter but it feels like for every  for every time we kind of whack that mole and knock one another three pop up so its probably  i didnt do the math before this call but i’m sure its a lot bigger than a million units right now there is more distribution at orbcomm we are in more geographies and i think the economy at least for now is humming along a little warmer than it was then someone else asked a question i meant to say this and it kind of bodes to what you are asking i think we did something like mid to low  units that we built in q and shipped and then we did  in q which we think is a cool number because q is a slow quarter i mean go back year after year after year and you kind of want to  you want to forget about qs but q we’re kind of watching that quarter for the hardware deployment and there is couple thousand units that are just kind of on the verge at the end of the quarter that we think we’re going to get in which would make this quarters hardware  million but we are building right now over  units and look at the progression here right from mid to low  low to mid s up to  and now we are kind of zoom up to  so we are like really confident that we are going to do closer to a  number between q and q we are just hoping that the q business falls in q because there is so much focus on our hardware there is more focus out of the building than in the building but the backlog looks strong and it looks like we are doing a pretty good job knocking it up david gearhart okay and just another question on pipeline with the hanjin bankruptcy has it affected your intermodal business in terms of more opportunity coming into the funnel just because of a lack of visibility on the containers that they have outstanding has materially helped orbcomm up to this point or it could be a tailwind for the near future just because of the puts and takes after that bankruptcy happened marc j eisenberg yes i think we had spoken to hanjin and we never ended up closing a deal there and we couldnt figure out why these guys werent at least working on their gensets and there is all the regulation around that and the california emissions and we werent able to close it and we couldnt figure out now we know why there were capital constraints but i havent seen weakness through their competitors clearly i know more right now than i’m saying in terms of pilots and other opportunities on the reefer container and container businesses theres a number of pilots out there that were working on that could generate again some more really large deals so we are seeing it heating up we are certainly being helped by regulation on the intermodal side where we are talking about rail now right we are moving to rail which i’m not sure if you are asking about sea containers or intermodal  david gearhart no it was just a broad question for multiple speakers marc j eisenberg yes so on the intermodal side i mean hunt and hub are behemoths in that market right they own a huge portion of the assets out there on the commercial side and then throw in swift too that we do as well and our market share in there has to be  plus in those areas and now we are getting all these followons and we are like can you show us what you are doing for jb hunt some of the other guys out there and then the big opportunity is the rail companies themselves own a number of intermodal containers and these guys are just a little slower moving than the rest of the industry so certainly chasing those down as well but we love the container business  love the container business david gearhart okay and last question for me one of your competitors is in process of launching their next satellite constellation somewhat of a different focus from orbcomm focused on connectivity and orbcomms more connectivity and solution but do you anticipate any impact on your pure connectivity business from competitor launches any headwinds to that effect or not really at this point marc j eisenberg you know i dont see it because if  these guys they are building these voice networks right and from an endtoend perspective i don’t know what it gives you right you know what mm hated mm hated when x went to g because they are saying to themselves well we are only using bits of data so we don’t need gigabytes of data so why do i want to have the extra power and pay the extra hardware fees and then g went to lte and were like ooh even scarier or even more power hungry and i kind of look at these constellations that are launching and its really more of the same so i dont know what the data rates go up to they go up to i dont know  to maybe  these are still relatively old technologies im not sure what else theyre doing but you know what we learned and i got to tell you this goes back all the way to jb hunt the first time i met them in  and you are sitting there with their dispatcher and their dispatcher is saying look at all the cool things i can do and i would love to know this and how do i deliver this and how can i reduce my fleet size and how can i make my drivers more efficient i’m pulling my hair out of my head this driver sitting here is container is not ready we sent the guy to fill up a full container i’m really struggling here how are you going to help me and that dispatcher did not know if it was cellular or satellite didnt care didnt care right its really all about how you can help them run their business and whether your network takes a minute to send that message or whether it takes eight seconds they are going to get the message and they are going to be able to be more productive and you look at jb hunt originally they are waiting for a phone call and now within a minute they know that the thing is empty and they can go and pick it up and that’s the power of what we are being able to deliver i wish all these guys luck there is a lot of capacity coming on the market in the nonmm areas its going to be a struggle in some of those industries but i know these guys a long time and i certainly wish them luck david gearhart okay thanks for that color that’s it for me marc j eisenberg sure operator and now we will hear from jim mcilree with chardan capital marc j eisenberg hi jim robert g costantini hi jim james mcilree hey good morning yes thanks a lot i just want to make sure i understand the hardware margins commentary that you made are you saying that the margins were lower and expected to be lower because you are accelerating deliveries or is it because the delivery sizes are larger and because they are larger  the prices are necessarily lower or is it a little bit of both marc j eisenberg i will let robert speak to it but i think he was saying both i think he said in q what was happening is these guys needed to get their products we were running behind and we were moving products from factory to factory to generate enough product to get them deployed and moving all those products around created a onetime  some onetime pain in q but what we are saying longterm is do you remember in the last call we said something like listen we don’t know if all the installs or all the shipments are going to happen this year or they are going to happen next year and these guys are running at margins that are lower than the average so if a lot of it falls into next year we will be at the lower end of the hardware but if it ships this year we will be in the highend of the hardware but the lower than average incremental sales will affect the average right and now we are thinking that we are going to ship nearly all  of these units this year and if you do it at a lower than average unit then its going to affect the mean ph yes so … james mcilree okay yes all right that makes sense and so the reason and so if you are shipping  if you are at the higher end of the unit shipments this year the reason that you are not expecting  the reason that you are not raising the service guidance is one you just want to be conservative and two there is a lag between shipments and indiscernible there is a lag marc j eisenberg but we think we are raising service guidance right we are thinking we are moving the range up because we are saying we are not going to come in at the low end now i understand its a very thin range between  and  but we think its going to be toward the higher end of that james mcilree right right no i did  i did hear that that’s great thank you and just a couple of other things so the pace of how things are going this year marc i was a little bit confused as to  your commentary made it sound like maybe q and q are really strong but q isnt because of the shipments to hunt and att is that right or are you just a little bit multiple speakers marc j eisenberg no no no i was referring to the pace in which we are building hardware so i’m not building hardware for q i’m building hardware for q and q and i think the comment was more around there is an awful lot of hardware we are shipping towards the end of q but most of the hardware for q is going to be shipped early so in terms of the lumpiness of the hardware by q i think we are all caught up and we ship i hope better than  million over the two quarters but i was kind of hedging which quarter this stuff should send robert g costantini indiscernible of schedule james mcilree okay all right that makes sense thanks and my last one is robert is there any change on the service margin outlook has any of what you guys have been talking about in terms of deployments impacted the service margins and by that i mean as a percent of revenues not the dollar amount robert g costantini yes i  we expect them to rise i mean that’s part of the equation the faster you get these service revenues on stream and the way the business is performing from a cost perspective on those platforms it was strong in q we were happy about that and we expect that to continue to improve that’s in front of us on the  the hardwares margin is a little more variable obviously we can see what’s in front of us so we know what to do and those are shorter term decisions but certainly the longer term outlook on service revenue margin is good it was good for the quarter and we expect it to continue to improve throughout the year i mean slightly  we don’t ever talk about this thing jumping five points a year but it should continue to be strong and show that  or so growth yearoveryear james mcilree all right i just wanted to make sure that there was nothing about the nature of the customers that would require  make things up now higher network costs or higher service costs robert g costantini no no its not like the product side of the equation james mcilree right marc j eisenberg i think margins are still incrementally greater than  across all our different types of subscribers jim i think these container ones big volumes but just smaller arpus little bit smaller arpus so that may be  sometimes it may look like a margin i don’t know james mcilree and if i said that was my last one i lied just one more robert what’s the projected interest quarterly interest past going forward is it just the  what the indiscernible robert g costantini yes  million indiscernible james mcilree okay fantastic thanks a lot i appreciate it good luck guys robert g costantini yes operator we will now hear from mike latimore with northland capital markets marc j eisenberg hi mike mike latimore yes nice quarter so just on service gross margin so that should even tick up again in the second quarter is that what you are thinking robert g costantini yes so whether it actually rises quartertoquarter don’t expect a lot i mean it grew sequentially from q to q by   basis points but again you just have to id say look at it over on a yearly basis we expect it to rise i cant give you quarteronquarter outlook but id say that we’ve been consistently able to do that marc j eisenberg let me just kind of rephrase this question a little bit because maybe it will add more insight the recurring revenues are  if its a  million a quarter the recurring revenues are anywhere between  they are typically around  million of it or so robert g costantini yes marc j eisenberg and then on top of that  million you’ve got roughly between  and  million of either its professional fees or its fees  insync licenses to guys like glencore and sometimes those tend to be lumpy and they confuse the  they confuse how we report sometimes so  sometimes people think its a margin going up and down or not when its just those sales kind of jumping in quartertoquarter mike latimore great guys that’s helpful and then the  just on the new unannounced oem i think you said  million in the quarter does that flow through both hardware and service and also is that kind of a decent run rate on a quarterly basis marc j eisenberg so that is  i’m going to explain it because the script is confusing because at one point it says over  million and one point it says up to  million so when we are talking about selling them our own product because we sell them two products which is their higher end product for their bigger machines it was just under  million of hardware and then in terms of what we ship them total hardware it was closer to  million which is why we said over a  million and that is a lower end device that we source and sell them someone elses product and that is almost  hardware these units are first going to be installed and its generating almost no service at all its a startup number its hard to explain without telling you who the customer is because their model  they are not your normal heavy equipment guy they dont build excavators and backhoes and tractors and stuff like that they build something else that’s heavy equipment so model is a little different and they don’t have a dealer network so they sell directly to endusers and fleets so there is a little bit of fleet by fleet stuff going on there which is different from the other businesses but i think  million to  million run rate is probably right mike latimore okay great and then just  you obviously raised your hardware guidance for the year a little bit there but in terms of the range that’s sort of left what are the kind of key factors that would get you to the upper versus the lower end of the range marc j eisenberg we think across our  million a quarter that we do which is just our maintenance business and hunt and att it gets us already to the middle of the range and then deals that we  the middle of what the range was and then certainly our huge sales force isnt taking vacation for the rest of the year in may so we think that we can go over and above based on what they are able to close between now and the end of the year which typically is a lot right so … mike latimore okay marc j eisenberg … i think we can hit the century mark and hopefully we can climb above that mike latimore and just last on the  just the manufacturing factory line whats left it sounds like there is still some tweaking going on there what’s left to sort of finish that process marc j eisenberg there is not a lot left there is  they are manufacturing on that line pretty well specific to j b hunt the  unit blanket order came just a couple of weeks ago and there is week lead times and we are rushing components and there is hundreds of components that go into the product and now we are running around china sourcing batteries and stuff like that and its more that than the actual manufacturing this line in this factory in sanmina is huge i mean we can just keep opening lines and we can get you millions of units in that factory so  but its the first time that that line had been used and they are building great products there were getting really high percentage of productive units out of there as we continue to test so not so much a concern but we fell behind in order to meet these customer deployments i will do it on twitter later i want to show you what a jb hunt stack looks like so you can get a feel for it when they are sitting there how anxious you are to get these things before they get moved while theyre sitting there in the stack and if you want to check it also you could see what a monthly walmart deployment looks like i put that on there as well but you will get a feel for it there but  they are herding ph they had the units stacked they had people ready to do deployments and we spent the extra dollars to get them their product sooner mike latimore yes okay great thank you operator and next we will hear from arun seshadri with crédit suisse arun seshadri hi guys thanks for taking my questions and welcome to the high yield market just a couple of things from me first in terms of opex just wanted to understand how we should see product developments and sga saw that down product development down a little and sga up a little if you can give us any commentary on cadence and ramp up as you add volume robert g costantini yes so those line items will generally be unaffected for  the guidance that we gave was about  to  sga we were happy to see that be a little bit lower in q because that’s typically a heavy quarter so i’d say that we’re not ready to bake that fully in for the year but there was a good start to the year there so that’s going to probably be well within the guidance range that we gave sga rather product development was lower than we had guided we were looking more like  million a quarter it came in  million i like that range so i think that that’s probably going to continue for the rest of the year but with respect to the ramp up those two line items will not be materially impacted by what we are talking about on the product side arun seshadri okay great thanks for that and as far as cash flow for the quarter working capital i saw a little bit of working capital this quarter versus last year obviously i’m sure related to the ramp up but just wanted to understand that a little bit better and how you see working capital spend for the rest of the year robert g costantini yes so you can see inventory was flat the receivables were up we were again a little bit off pace on cash flow from operations in q i would say primarily because of the ramp up so its all related to that we expect to do better on the inventory side and as historically you look at orbcomm cash flow from operations improves throughout the year as we continue to grow so this will have a little bit of a growth element to it this year than we’ve seen in the past so working capital probably be up a little bit higher i think last year was in terms of the increase was about  million that looks like a reasonably good number for me this year especially in what we are doing we are going to do a lot to keep inventory continue to be increase our turns get that as tuned up as we can good customers here so i don’t expect a lot invested really in receivables it will just be a timing thing so again i think that’s how its going to play out throughout the year it will continue to grow quarteroverquarter arun seshadri okay great last thing from me capex you obviously came in a little bit higher than your  million to  million for fullyear guidance in sustaining capex and growth capex how should we  possible you end up higher than the  million or is there some lumpiness robert g costantini no there is no lumpiness there i mean there is a labor component to it and a spending component and the spending component is kind of variable just depending on what those guys are up to its not at all a straightline type of event so i’m still holding the line right now and i will get back to you guys in q and see if that changes but i think we are probably at that  million number for the year arun seshadri thanks very much marc j eisenberg yes operator and now we will hear from chris quilty with quilty analytics chris quilty hey marc just one followup question on europe i know you bought the euroscan acquisition as a sort of an entry point into the european market and that came with a recorder product can you give us an update on how successful you’ve been in migrating other product and capabilities into the european market in the last couple of years marc j eisenberg just recently they’ve picked it up pretty significantly well first of all in their recorder product they are doing roughly  times the service revenues that they were doing when we purchased the company so that transition has done well the second thing that they did is they support the european product not as much the guys here in the united states so they enabled us to land the carrier deal and then lastly they’ve picked up the rest of our products like this shipping deal that we talked about between europe and africa that is also euroscan deal that they’ve picked up so i’d give them extremely high grades on that acquisition chris quilty great that was my only question operator operator instructions we will now hear from scott searle with benchmark scott searle hey good morning marc j eisenberg hi scott scott searle can you guys just indiscernible clean up on a couple of questions here did you mention any  customers and just given the strength in ais and the new relationships in canada on trail what do you expect the exit rate to be for  marc j eisenberg i’m sorry we don’t have any  customers unless jb hunt rolls up there just on their hardware sales and then disappears again robert g costantini yes yes that will be the case right marc j eisenberg so our largest customer i think was at  or  of sales and as the company grows we tend to grow outward not vertically through i mean the customers are certainly growing but not at the rate that we are adding customers robert g costantini concentration is improving its diluted not concentrating rather marc j eisenberg and what was the second question scott searle ais just the exit rate for this year robert g costantini yes its growing  million kind of grows every quarter to the point indiscernible scott searle okay and just a clarification on the hardware front more units than subs coming on how much  is that just getting ahead of subscribers being installed on vehicles in line or is there an upgrade cycle that’s going on and i guess kind of embedded in that marc j eisenberg so there is a bunch of things here scott searle yes marc j eisenberg are you ready for this you got your pen out so the  subs a small portion of them are nonwireless subs and that’s the recorder business that chris was talking about and that business gets smaller as the wireless business gets higher but that’s thousands that’s not tens of thousands secondly there is a portion of the skywave business that is pretty stable service but its actually recurring hardware and that’s the buoy business so the buoy business is roughly  or  buoys a quarter  i’m sorry a year where the sub numbers stay the same but you are swapping out the hardware and that adds to it and then the last thing that’s in that number is the hardware is gross and the sub number we give you is net so the sub number includes  or  annual churn so  to  on that  ph million is  its a low percentage but its still a large number of subscribers so you’ve to back that out as well scott searle and marc given the new products is there a large installed base that might be due for an upgrade cycle here in the next year or two marc j eisenberg for every year scott searle every year marc j eisenberg every year i mean if you look at our trucking companies they don’t buy them all in one year so as a deployment gets more mature you deploy on the new truck and maybe the old truck goes out of service and then the account grows as their fleet grows scott searle hey marc and last question from me just to smooth out a little bit of the volatility in the hardware front what’s the latest thought in terms of leasing hardware and the appetite on the customer base to look at that digest it deploy it thanks marc j eisenberg so we do that a little bit today we have specific customers and we have built out a program to do some leasing we don’t do it on our own balance sheet because until now the capital that we had was spoken for so we use a thirdparty bank typically to finance those but there is a leasing platform out there now when we closed our jb hunt deal we priced it in a leasing model and we priced it also where they buy the units upfront and i’m guessing their cost of capital is lower than ours so that’s the way they chose to go scott searle great thank you marc j eisenberg sure operator and at this time we’ve no further questions in the queue i’d like to turn the floor back to mr eisenberg for any additional or closing remarks a  marc j eisenberg thank you for your questions
