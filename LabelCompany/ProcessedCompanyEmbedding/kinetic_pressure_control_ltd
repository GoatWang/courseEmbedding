reading questions the meters flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow the differential pressure sensor may be damaged avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of  psid  psid for “whisper” series instruments a common cause of this problem is instantaneous application of highpressure gas as from a snap acting solenoid valve upstream of the meter damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty the controllers flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow differential pressure sensor may be damaged avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of  psid  psid for “whisper” series instruments while in most cases the valve will help to protect the sensor against large pressure drops a sudden change in pressures can subject the sensor to high pressure drops if the valve does not have enough time to adjust  damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty the meters flow reading is fixed at zero regardless of actual flow rate alicat mass flow meters are equipped with a tare function via grounding a specified pin  please check electrical connections to ensure this pin is not grounded  pin out diagrams are available in the back of the manual for your reference the meter reads negative flow when there is a confirmed no flow condition this is an indication of an improper tare if the meter is tared while there is flow that flow is accepted as zero flow when an actual zero flow condition exists the meter will read a negative flow simply retare at the confirmed zero flow condition also note that while the meter is intended for positive flow it will read negative flow with reasonable accuracy it is not calibrated for bidirectional flow and no damage will result the flow flutters or is jumpy the meters are very fast and will pick up any actual flow fluctuations such as from a diaphragm pump etc also inspect the inside of the upstream connection for debris such a teflon tape shreds mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average gra for both pressure and flow rate measurements that can aid in allowing fluctuating flow to be read this can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications the meter does not agree with another meter i have in line volumetric meters will often not agree with one another when put in series because they are affected by pressure drops volumetric flow meters should not be compared to mass flow meters mass flow meters can be compared against one another provided there are no leaks between the two meters and they are set to the same standard temperature and pressure both meters must also be calibrated or set for the gas being measured m series mass flow meters are normally set to standard temperature and pressure conditions of ° c and  psia the standard temperature and pressure can be changed via the front panel and serial communications it can also be ordered with specialty standard temperature and pressure my volumetric meter reading is strange inconsistent or incorrect make sure you use a volumetric flow meter only under low pressure close to atmospheric and with little to no back pressure for accurate readings mass meters should be used for higher pressure applications the device jumps to zero at low flow mass flow and pressure devices feature a programmable deadband or zero band the factory setting is usually  of full scale this can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications gas compatibility concerns my device has a specific gas listed in the part number can i use it with other gases absolutely the gas that appears in the part number is what your unit has been preselected to when you received it from the factory you will still have access to gas select™  which has  or more preloaded gas calibrations to choose from as well as our composer™ firmware which allows you to create up to  custom gas compositions i accidentally selected the wrong gas what can i do both the mass flow rate and volumetric flow rate depend on the viscosity of the gas if a different gas is selected than what is flowing through the device the flow rates will be off by approximately the ratio of the viscosities simply take your reading and multiply by the ratio of the selected gas’s viscosity to the desired gas’s viscosity a detailed description with examples can be found at wwwalicatcomfaqaccidentallywronggasselectedcan communications help the display does not come on or is weak check power and ground connections the output signal is lower than the reading at the display this can occur if the output signal is measured some distance from the meter as voltage drops in the wires increase with distance using heavier gauge wires especially in the ground wire can reduce this effect the device is responding slower than expected mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average gra for both pressure and flow rate measurements that may lead to a slower perceived response time this can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications controllers also have programmable valve tuning available via the front panel and serial communications which can further improve the response time my device is locked

if you have questions you can contact them at bwwebmasterbusinessweekcom close thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control  wikipedia thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search energy profile diagram for kinetic versus thermodynamic product reaction thermodynamic reaction control or kinetic reaction control in a chemical reaction can decide the composition in a reaction product mixture when competing pathways lead to different products and the reaction conditions influence the selectivity or stereoselectivity the distinction is relevant when product a forms faster than product b because the activation energy for product a is lower than that for product b yet product b is more stable in such a case a is the kinetic product and is favoured under kinetic control and b is the thermodynamic product and is favoured under thermodynamic control the conditions of the reaction such as temperature pressure or solvent affect which reaction pathway may be favored either the kinetically controlled or the thermodynamically controlled one note this is only true if the activation energy of the two pathways differ with one pathway having a lower ea energy of activation than the other prevalence of thermodynamic or kinetic control determines the final composition of the product when these competing reaction pathways lead to different products the reaction conditions as mentioned above influence the selectivity of the reaction  ie which pathway is taken contents  scope  in dielsalder reactions  in enolate chemistry  in electrophilic additions  characteristics  history  references scopeedit in dielsalder reactionsedit the dielsalder reaction of cyclopentadiene with furan can produce two isomeric products at room temperature kinetic reaction control prevails and the less stable endo isomer  is the main reaction product at  °c and after long reaction times the chemical equilibrium can assert itself and the thermodynamically more stable exo isomer  is formedcitation needed the exo product is more stable by virtue of a lower degree of steric congestion while the endo product is favoured by orbital overlap in the transition state in enolate chemistryedit in the protonation of an enolate ion the kinetic product is the enol and the thermodynamic product is a ketone or aldehyde carbonyl compounds and their enols interchange rapidly by proton transfers catalyzed by acids or bases even in trace amounts in this case mediated by the enolate or the proton source in the deprotonation of an unsymmetrical ketone the kinetic product is the enolate resulting from removal of the most accessible αh while the thermodynamic product has the more highly substituted enolate moiety use of low temperatures and sterically demanding bases increases the kinetic selectivity here the difference in pkb between the base and the enolate is so large that the reaction is essentially irreversible so the equilibration leading to the thermodynamic product is likely a proton exchange occurring during the addition between the kinetic enolate and asyetunreacted ketone an inverse addition adding ketone to the base with rapid mixing would minimize this the position of the equilibrium will depend on the countercation and solvent if a much weaker base is used the deprotonation will be incomplete and there will be an equilibrium between reactants and products thermodynamic control is obtained however the reaction remains incomplete unless the product enolate is trapped as in the example below since h transfers are very fast the trapping reaction being slower the ratio of trapped products largely mirrors the deprotonation equilibrium in electrophilic additionsedit the electrophilic addition reaction of hydrogen bromide to butadiene above room temperature leads predominantly to the thermodynamically more stable  adduct bromobutene but decreasing the reaction temperature to below room temperature favours the kinetic  adduct bromobutene the rationale for the differing selectivities is as follows both products result from markovnikov protonation at position  resulting in a resonancestabilized allylic cation the  adduct places the larger br atom at a less congested site and includes a more highly substituted alkene moiety while the  adduct is the result of the attack by the nucleophile br− at the carbon of the allylic cation bearing the greatest positive charge the more highly substituted carbon is the most likely place for the positive charge characteristicsedit in every reaction the first product formed is that which is most easily formed thus every reaction a priori starts under kinetic control a necessary condition for thermodynamic control is reversibility or a mechanism permitting the equilibration between products reactions are considered to take place under thermodynamic reaction control when the reverse reaction is sufficiently rapid that the equilibrium establishes itself within the allotted reaction time in this way the thermodynamically more stable product is always favoured under kinetic reaction control the forward reaction is faster than the reverse reaction after reaction time t the product ratio is the ratio of rate constants k and thus a function of the difference in activation energies ea or δg‡ ln ⁡   a  t  b  t   ln ⁡  k a k b   − δ e a r t  is small which would be the case if the overall transformations to each product were of the same molecularity for instance if both were fragmentations of a molecule to produce a pair of molecules or if both were condensations of two molecules to give a single molecule  studies on dieneaddition reactions ii the reaction of pentamethylenefulvene with maleic anhydride r b woodward harold baer j am chem soc

reading questions the meters flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow the differential pressure sensor may be damaged avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of  psid  psid for “whisper” series instruments a common cause of this problem is instantaneous application of highpressure gas as from a snap acting solenoid valve upstream of the meter damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty the controllers flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow differential pressure sensor may be damaged avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of  psid  psid for “whisper” series instruments while in most cases the valve will help to protect the sensor against large pressure drops a sudden change in pressures can subject the sensor to high pressure drops if the valve does not have enough time to adjust  damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty the meters flow reading is fixed at zero regardless of actual flow rate alicat mass flow meters are equipped with a tare function via grounding a specified pin  please check electrical connections to ensure this pin is not grounded  pin out diagrams are available in the back of the manual for your reference the meter reads negative flow when there is a confirmed no flow condition this is an indication of an improper tare if the meter is tared while there is flow that flow is accepted as zero flow when an actual zero flow condition exists the meter will read a negative flow simply retare at the confirmed zero flow condition also note that while the meter is intended for positive flow it will read negative flow with reasonable accuracy it is not calibrated for bidirectional flow and no damage will result the flow flutters or is jumpy the meters are very fast and will pick up any actual flow fluctuations such as from a diaphragm pump etc also inspect the inside of the upstream connection for debris such a teflon tape shreds mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average gra for both pressure and flow rate measurements that can aid in allowing fluctuating flow to be read this can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications the meter does not agree with another meter i have in line volumetric meters will often not agree with one another when put in series because they are affected by pressure drops volumetric flow meters should not be compared to mass flow meters mass flow meters can be compared against one another provided there are no leaks between the two meters and they are set to the same standard temperature and pressure both meters must also be calibrated or set for the gas being measured m series mass flow meters are normally set to standard temperature and pressure conditions of ° c and  psia the standard temperature and pressure can be changed via the front panel and serial communications it can also be ordered with specialty standard temperature and pressure my volumetric meter reading is strange inconsistent or incorrect make sure you use a volumetric flow meter only under low pressure close to atmospheric and with little to no back pressure for accurate readings mass meters should be used for higher pressure applications the device jumps to zero at low flow mass flow and pressure devices feature a programmable deadband or zero band the factory setting is usually  of full scale this can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications gas compatibility concerns my device has a specific gas listed in the part number can i use it with other gases absolutely the gas that appears in the part number is what your unit has been preselected to when you received it from the factory you will still have access to gas select™  which has  or more preloaded gas calibrations to choose from as well as our composer™ firmware which allows you to create up to  custom gas compositions i accidentally selected the wrong gas what can i do both the mass flow rate and volumetric flow rate depend on the viscosity of the gas if a different gas is selected than what is flowing through the device the flow rates will be off by approximately the ratio of the viscosities simply take your reading and multiply by the ratio of the selected gas’s viscosity to the desired gas’s viscosity a detailed description with examples can be found at wwwalicatcomfaqaccidentallywronggasselectedcan communications help the display does not come on or is weak check power and ground connections the output signal is lower than the reading at the display this can occur if the output signal is measured some distance from the meter as voltage drops in the wires increase with distance using heavier gauge wires especially in the ground wire can reduce this effect the device is responding slower than expected mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average gra for both pressure and flow rate measurements that may lead to a slower perceived response time this can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications controllers also have programmable valve tuning available via the front panel and serial communications which can further improve the response time my device is locked and lck is showing on the screen alicat devices come with a locking option for applications in which the buttons may accidentally be pressed changing crucial device settings devices with newer
