recommendations pj lee i am writing in support of powerscout an innovative startup making significant strides to address the high customer acquisition costs of residential solar having seen demonstrations of the powerscout platform i was impressed by the depth of the data platform and the intuitive way that the data is presented to consumers the ability to move the solar prospecting and sales process online will be absolutely critical to the next phase of market growth and powerscout’s technology is substantially ahead of the competition i am also familiar with the founding team and have previously worked with them in a professional capacity i have seen their vision and execution ability first hand and have no doubt that they will develop powerscout into the preeminent customer acquisition engine for clean energy on this basis i strongly recommend powerscout to the dubai future accelerator program and encourage the program administrators to review their application carefully jan p rohde managing director at xcentio consulting i have known the founder attila toth for  years and can attest to his vision impeccable drive to get things done and ability to deliver a high quality technology product he has assembled a team with deep expertise in the residential solar market with an excellent understanding of the key pain points facing the industry powerscout is the first company i have seen using big dataai to understand the customer and provide value propositions custom tailored to them it would arm consumers like myself with powerful home energy analytics during the buying process to ensure an informed decision is made having led strategy formulation at semigovernment level to make dubai a better place i strongly believing in putting the customer first i reckon that powerscout’s approach focusing on data driven marketingecommerce will be able to disrupt a highly inefficient status quo i believe that they would be a strong addition to the  class of
