supplemental information supplementary information following is a summary of the application the complete application is available for a fee from the secs public reference branch  fifth street nw washington dc  tel   applicants representations  the fund is a massachusetts business trust registered as an openend management investment company the fund commenced operations on may   and currently consists of one series additional series may be added in the future  calamos is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of  and will be the investment manager for the fund  the fund intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies supporting variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts separate accounts owning shares of the fund and their insurance company depositors are referred to as “participating separate accounts” and “participating insurance companies” respectively  the fund also intends to offer one or more series of its shares directly to qualified pension and retirement plans “plans” outside the separate account context the plans will be pension or retirement plans intended to qualify under sections a and c of the internal revenue code of  as amended “code” the funds shares will be sold to plans which are or are designed to be subject to the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa” as amended participating separate accounts participating insurance companies and plans are collectively referred to as “participants”  the participating insurance companies will establish their own participating separate accounts and design their own contracts each start printed page participating insurance company will enter into a fund participation agreement with the funds on behalf of its participating separate account and will have the legal obligation of satisfying all requirements under state and federal law the role of the fund so far as the federal securities laws are applicable will be to offer their shares to separate accounts of participating insurance companies and to plans and to fulfill any conditions that the commission may impose upon granting the order requested in the application  plans may choose the fund or any series thereof as their sole investment or as one of several investments plan participants may or may not be given an investment choice depending on the plan itself shares of the fund sold to plans would be held by the trustees of the plans as mandated by section a of erisa calamos will not act as investment adviser to any of the plans that will purchase shares of the fund there will be no passthrough voting to the participants in such plans as it is not required to be provided under erisa applicants legal analysis  applicants request that the commission issue an order under section c of the  act granting exemptive relief from sections a a and a and b of the  act and rules eb and etb thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the fund to be offered and sold to variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies and to plans  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a unit investment trust rule eb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the exemptions granted by rule eb are available however only where the management investment company underlying the separate account “underlying fund” offers its shares “exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company   ” therefore the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity or flexible premium variable life insurance separate account of the same company or of any affiliated life insurance company the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same insurance company or of any affiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “mixed funding” in addition the relief granted by rule eb is not available if shares of the underlying management investment company are offered to variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of the same insurance company or of any unaffiliated life insurance company is referred to herein as “shared funding”  in connection with the funding of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act the exemptions granted by rule etb are available however only where the separate accounts underlying fund offers its shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account   ” therefore rule etb permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account however rule etb does not permit shared funding because the relief granted by rule etb is not available with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of a management investment company that also offers its shares to separate accounts including flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated life insurance companies  applicants state that the relief granted by rules eb and etb is not affected by the purchase of shares of the fund by a plan however because the relief under rules eb and etb is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to separate accounts exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the fund are also to be sold to plans  applicants state that the current tax law permits the fund to increase its asset base through the sale of shares to plans section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of the variable contracts the code provides that such contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance contract for any period during which the investments are not adequately diversified in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury department treasury regulations provide that to meet the diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in an investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies the regulations do contain certain exceptions to this requirement however one of which permits shares of an investment company to be held by the trustee of a plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company also to be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts treas reg §  fiii  applicants state that the promulgation of rules eb and etb preceded the issuance of these treasury regulations which made it possible for shares of a fund to be held by the trustee of a plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares of the fund to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable life insurance contracts thus applicants assert that the sale of shares of a fund to separate accounts through which variable life insurance contracts are issued and plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of rules eb and etb given the thencurrent tax law  applicants assert that if the funds were to sell shares only to plans or to separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts no exemptive relief would be necessary applicants state that none of the relief provided under rules eb and etb relates to plans or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such purchasers exemptive relief is requested in the application only because some of the separate accounts that will invest in the fund or series thereof may themselves be investment companies that rely on rules e and et and that desire to have the relief continue in place  in general section a of the  act disqualifies any person convicted of certain offenses and any company start printed page affiliated with that person from serving in various capacities with respect to an underlying registered management investment company more specifically section a of the  act provides that it is unlawful for any company to act as investment adviser to or principal underwriter for any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules e­bi and ii and etbi and ii provide partial exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in the management of the underlying management investment company  applicants state that the relief provided by rules eb and e­tb permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying funds investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a are participating in the management or administration of the fund applicants state that the partial relief from section a provided by rules eb and etb in effect limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  applicants assert that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act to apply the provisions of section a to the many individuals in an insurance company complex most of whom typically will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies funding the separate accounts applicants assert that it also is unnecessary to apply the restrictions of section a to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies that may utilize the funds as a funding medium for variable contracts moreover applicants state that the appropriateness of the relief requested will not be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the fund to plans because the insulation of the fund from those individuals who are disqualified under the  act remains in place  applicants state that rules e­biii and etbiii under the  act provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed  applicants further represent that the sale of fund shares to plans should not affect the relief requested with respect to plans there is no requirement to passthrough voting rights to plan participants shares of the funds sold to plans would be held by the trustees of such plans as mandated by section a of erisa section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the plan with two exceptions a when the plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the plan and not contrary to erisa and b when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa unless one of the two exceptions stated in section a applies the plan trustees have exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies  applicants state that where a named fiduciary appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or the named fiduciary accordingly applicants submit that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with respect to plans since such plans are not entitled to passthrough voting privileges  applicants generally expect many plans to have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the plan in their discretion some of the plans however may provide for the trustees or investment advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants applicants submit that where a plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions there is no potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among contract owners and plan investors with respect to voting of the funds shares applicants further submit that where a plan does provide participants with the right to give voting instructions they see no reason to believe that participants in plans generally or those in a particular plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage contract owners the purchase of shares of the fund by plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed and shared funding  applicants submit that even if a plan were to hold a controlling interest in the fund such control would not disadvantage other investors in the fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the voting securities of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in the fund by a plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed and shared funding unlike mixed or shared funding plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  applicants state that no increased conflicts of interest would be presented by the granting of the requested relief applicants assert that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several states applicants note that where different participating insurance companies are domiciled in different states it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one participating insurance company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other insurance regulators in one or more other states in which other participating insurance companies are domiciled applicants submit that this possibility is no different or greater than exists where a single insurer and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states  applicants further submit that affiliation does not reduce the potential for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions discussed below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that these differences may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its participating separate accounts investment in the fund  applicants also argue that affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to when a participating insurance company could disregard contract owner voting instructions potential disagreement is limited by the start printed page requirement that disregarding voting instructions be both reasonable and based on specified good faith determinations however if a participating insurance companys decision to disregard contract owner voting instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change such participating insurance company may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its separate account investment in the fund no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such a withdrawal  applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of the fund with mixed funding would or should be materially different from what those policies would or should be if the fund supported only variable annuity or only variable life insurance contracts hence applicants state there is no reason to believe that conflicts of interest would result from mixed funding moreover applicants represent that the fund will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of contract  as noted above section h of the code imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying the variable contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies treasury regulation section fiii which establishes diversification requirements for such portfolios specifically permits among other things “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company therefore applicants assert that neither the code the treasury regulations nor the revenue rulings thereunder recognize or proscribe any inherent conflicts of interest if qualified plans variable annuity separate accounts and variable life separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from variable contracts and plans are taxed the tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest when distributions are to be made and the participating separate account or a plan cannot net purchase payments to make the distributions the participating separate account or plan will redeem shares of the fund at their net asset value in conformity with rule c under the  act to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs the plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan the life insurance company will surrender values from the separate account into the general account to make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract  applicants state that the sale of shares to plans should not increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors applicants submit that there should be very little potential for such conflicts beyond that which would otherwise exist between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners  applicants also state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to participating separate account contract owners and to plans the transfer agent for the fund will inform each participating insurance company of each participating separate accounts share ownership in the fund as well as inform the trustees of plans of their holdings the participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions in accordance with rules e and e t as applicable and its participation agreement with the fund shares held by plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to plans with respect to shares of the fund would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to plans with respect to shares of funds sold to the general public  applicants submit that the ability of the fund to sell its shares directly to plans does not create a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the  act with respect to any contract owner as opposed to a plans participant regardless of the rights and benefits of plan participants or contract owners the plans and the participating separate accounts only have rights with respect to their respective shares of the fund no shareholder of the fund has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payments of dividends  applicants state that there are no conflicts between the contract owners of participating separate accounts and plan participants with respect to the state insurance commissioners veto powers over investment objectives the basic premise of shareholder voting is that shareholders may not all agree with a particular proposal while interests and opinions of shareholders may differ however this does not mean that there are any inherent conflicts of interest between or among such shareholders state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies usually cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest in another generally complex and timeconsuming transactions must be undertaken to accomplish such redemptions and transfers conversely trustees of plans can make the decision quickly and redeem their shares of the fund and reinvest in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments faced by separate accounts or as is the case with most plans even hold cash pending a suitable investment based on the foregoing applicants represent that even should the interests of contract owners and the interests of plans conflict the conflicts can be resolved almost immediately because the trustees of the plans can independently redeem shares out of the fund  applicants also assert that there does not appear to be any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of plan participants and contract owners of participating insurance companies from possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners  applicants believe that the summary of the discussion contained herein demonstrates that the sale of shares of the fund to qualified plans and variable contracts does not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest furthermore applicants state that the use of the fund with respect to plans is not substantially different from the funds current use in that plans like variable contracts are generally longterm retirement vehicles in addition applicants assert that regardless of the type of shareholder in the fund calamos is or would be contractually or otherwise obligated to manage the fund solely and exclusively in accordance with the funds investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by the funds board of trustees  applicants assert that various factors have prevented more insurance companies from offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts than currently do so these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding medium the lack of expertise with respect to investment management and the lack of public name recognition as investment professionals in particular some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the variable contract business on their own start printed page applicants assert that use of the fund as a common investment medium for variable contracts would ameliorate these concerns participating insurance companies would benefit not only from the investment advisory and administrative expertise of calamos and its affiliates but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds applicants submit that therefore making the fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts applicants claim that this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges moreover the sale of the shares of the fund to plans should further increase the amount of assets available for investment by the fund this in turn should inure to the benefit of contract owners by promoting economies of scale by permitting greater safety through greater diversification and by making the addition of new portfolios to the fund more feasible  applicants assert that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding and sales of fund shares to plans applicants conditions applicant consents to the following conditions if the application is granted  a majority of the board of trustees or board of directors “board” of the fund shall consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined by section a of the act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or director then the operation of this condition shall be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by rule or by order upon application  the board will monitor the fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict among the interests of the contract owners of all separate accounts investing in the fund and of plan participants investing in the fund a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretative letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of any fund or series are being managed e a difference in voting instruction given by variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners f a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a plan to disregard voting instructions of plan participants  in the event that a plan or plan participant shareholder should become an owner of  or more of the assets of the fund such plan will execute a fund participation agreement including the conditions of the application set forth herein to the extent applicable a plan or plan participant will execute an application containing an acknowledgement of this condition at the time of its initial purchase of shares of a fund  participating insurance companies calamos any other investment adviser of the fund and any plans that execute a fund participation agreement upon becoming an owner of  or more of the funds assets “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the board participants will be responsible for assisting the board in carrying out its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard contract owner voting instructions and when passthrough voting is applicable an obligation of each plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard voting instructions from plan participants the responsibilities to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies and plans under their agreements governing participation in the fund and such agreements shall provide in the case of participating insurance companies that such responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of contract owners or in the case of plans plan participants  if it is determined by a majority of the board or a majority of its disinterested trustees or directors that a material irreconcilable conflict exists the relevant participating insurance companies and plans at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors shall take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict such steps could include a withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the separate accounts from the fund or any series thereof and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium which may include another series of the fund b submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie annuity or life insurance contract owners or variable contract owners of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change and c establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurers decision to disregard contract owner voting instructions and the decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the insurer may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a plans decision to disregard plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the plan may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its investment in such fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal to the extent permitted by applicable law the responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies and plans under their agreements governing participation in the fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the contract owners and plan participants as appropriate  for purposes of condition  a majority of the disinterested members of the board shall determine whether or not any proposed action adequately start printed page remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will the fund or calamos or any other investment adviser be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract no participating insurance company shall be required by condition  to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been declined by a vote of the majority of contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict no plan shall be required by this condition  to establish a new funding medium for such plan if a an offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict or b pursuant to governing plan documents and applicable law the plan makes such decision without a plan participant vote  participants will be informed promptly in writing of the boards determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications  participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to contract owners who invest in participating separate accounts so long as the commission continues to interpret the  act as requiring passthough voting privileges for contract owners accordingly participating insurance companies will vote shares of the fund or series thereof held in participating separate accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from contract owners in addition each participating insurance company will vote shares of the fund or series thereof held in its separate accounts for which it has not received timely voting instructions as well as shares it owns in the same proportion as those shares for which it has received voting instructions participating insurance companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their participating separate accounts calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other participating insurance companies the obligation to vote the funds shares and calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other participating separate accounts shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under the agreements governing participation in the fund each plan will vote as required by applicable law and governing plan documents  the fund will notify all participating insurance companies and plans that disclosure in separate account prospectuses or plan prospectuses or other plan disclosure documents

investing in the fund may conflict and c the board will monitor for the existence of any material conflicts and determine what action if any should be taken  all reports of potential or existing conflicts of interest received by the board and all board action with regard to a determining the existence of a conflict b notifying participants of a conflict and c determining whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict will be properly recorded in the minutes of the board or other appropriate records and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the commission upon request  if and to the extent rule e rule et are amended or rule e under the  act is adopted to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the  act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed or shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested by applicants then the fund andor participating insurance companies as appropriate shall take such steps as may be necessary to comply with rules e and et as amended and proposed ruled e as adopted to the extent applicable  the fund will comply with all provisions of the  act requiring voting by shareholders for these purposes the persons having a voting interest in the shares of the fund in particular the fund will either provide for annual meetings except to the extent that the commission may interpret section  of the  act not to require such meetings or comply with section c of the  act although the fund is not one of the trusts described in section c of the act as well as with section a and if and when applicable section b of the  act further the fund will act in accordance with the commissions interpretation of the requirements of section a with respect

the prospectus contains information concerning each funds investment objective and principal investment strategies and risks this sai provides additional information concerning certain securities and strategies used by the funds and their associated risks in pursuing its investment objective each fund will invest as described below and in the prospectus convertible securities convertible securities include any corporate debt security or preferred stock that may be converted into underlying shares of common stock the common stock underlying convertible securities may be issued by a different entity than the issuer of the convertible securities convertible securities entitle the holder to receive interest payments paid on corporate debt securities or the dividend preference on a preferred stock until such time as the convertible security matures or is redeemed or until the holder elects to exercise the conversion privilege as a result of the conversion feature however the interest rate or dividend preference on a convertible security is generally less than would be the case if the securities were issued in nonconvertible form the value of convertible securities is influenced by both the yield of nonconvertible securities of comparable issuers and by the value of the underlying common stock the value of a convertible security viewed without regard to its conversion feature ie strictly on the basis of its yield is sometimes referred to as its investment value the investment value of the convertible security typically will fluctuate inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates however at the same time the convertible security will be influenced by its conversion value which is the market value of the underlying common stock that would be obtained if the convertible security were converted conversion value fluctuates directly with the price of the underlying common stock if because of a low price of the common stock the conversion value is substantially below the investment value of the convertible security the price of the convertible security is governed principally by its investment value if the conversion value of a convertible security increases to a point that approximates or exceeds its investment value the value of the security will be principally influenced by its conversion value a convertible security will sell at a premium over its conversion value to the extent investors place value on the right to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed income security holders of convertible securities have a claim on the assets of the issuer prior to the common stockholders but may be subordinated to holders of similar nonconvertible securities of the same issuer synthetic convertible securities the funds may create a synthetic convertible security by combining fixed income securities with the right to acquire equity securities in creating a synthetic security the fund may pool a basket of fixedincome securities and a basket of warrants or options that produce the economic characteristics similar to a convertible security within each basket of fixedincome  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th securities and warrants or options different companies may issue the fixedincome and convertible components which may be purchased separately and at different times more flexibility is possible in the assembly of a synthetic convertible security than in the purchase of a convertible security although synthetic convertible securities may be selected where the two components are issued by a single issuer the character of a synthetic convertible security allows the combination of components representing distinct issuers when management believes that such a combination would better promote the funds investment objective a synthetic convertible security also is a more flexible investment in that its two components may be purchased separately for example the fund may purchase a warrant for inclusion in a synthetic convertible security but temporarily hold shortterm investments while postponing the purchase of a corresponding bond pending development of more favorable market conditions the convertible funds holdings of synthetic convertible securities are considered convertible securities for purposes of the funds policy to invest at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings in convertible securities a holder of a synthetic convertible security faces the risk of a decline in the price of the security or the level of the index involved in the convertible component causing a decline in the value of the call option or warrant purchased to create the synthetic convertible security should the price of the stock fall below the exercise price and remain there throughout the exercise period the entire amount paid for the call option or warrant would be lost because a synthetic convertible security includes the fixedincome component as well the holder of a synthetic convertible security also faces the risk that interest rates will rise causing a decline in the value of the fixedincome instrument the funds may also purchase synthetic convertible securities manufactured by other parties including convertible structured notes convertible structured notes are fixed income debentures linked to equity and are typically issued by investment banks convertible structured notes have the attributes of a convertible security however the investment bank that issued the convertible note assumes the credit risk associated with the investment rather than the issuer of the underlying common stock into which the note is convertible debt securities in pursuing its investment objective each fund may invest in convertible and nonconvertible debt securities including lowerrated securities ie securities rated bb or lower by standard  poors corporation a division of the mcgrawhill companies sp or ba or lower by moodys investor services inc moodys and securities that are not rated but are considered by the investment adviser to be of similar quality there are no restrictions as to the ratings of debt securities acquired by a fund or the portion of a funds assets that may be invested in debt securities in a particular ratings category except that no fund other than the high yield fund will acquire a security rated below c securities rated bbb or baa are considered to be medium grade and to have speculative characteristics lowerrated debt securities are predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal investment in medium or lowerquality debt securities involves greater investment risk including the possibility of issuer default or  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th bankruptcy an economic downturn could severely disrupt the market for such securities and adversely affect the value of such securities in addition lowerquality bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than higherquality instruments and generally are more sensitive to adverse economic changes or individual corporate developments during a period of adverse economic changes including a period of rising interest rates issuers of such bonds may experience difficulty in servicing their principal and interest payment obligations achievement by each fund of its investment objectives will be more dependent on the investment advisers credit analysis than would be the case if the fund were investing in higherquality debt securities because the ratings of rating services which evaluate the safety of principal and interest payments not market risks are used only as preliminary indicators of investment quality the investment adviser employs its own credit research and analysis these analyses may take into consideration such quantitative factors as an issuers present and potential liquidity profitability internal capability to generate funds debtequity ratio and debt servicing capabilities and such qualitative factors as an assessment of management industry characteristics accounting methodology and foreign business exposure medium and lowerquality debt securities may be less marketable than higherquality debt securities because the market for them is less broad the market for unrated debt securities is even narrower during periods of thin trading in these markets the spread between bid and asked prices is likely to increase significantly and the fund may have greater difficulty selling its portfolio securities the market value of these securities and their liquidity may be affected by adverse publicity and investor perceptions rule a securities each fund may purchase securities that have been privately placed but that are eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified institutional buyers such as the funds under rule a under the securities act of  the investment adviser under the supervision of the trusts board of trustees will consider whether securities purchased under rule a are illiquid and thus subject to the funds restriction of investing no more than a specified percentage of its net assets in illiquid securities a determination of whether a rule a security is liquid or not is a question of fact in making this determination the investment adviser will consider the trading markets for the specific security taking into account the unregistered nature of a rule a security in addition the investment adviser may consider the  frequency of trades and quotes  number of dealers and potential purchasers  dealer undertakings to make a market and  nature of a security and of marketplace trades eg the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer the liquidity of rule a securities will be monitored and if as a result of changed conditions it is determined that a rule a security is no longer liquid the funds holdings of illiquid securities would be reviewed to determine what if any steps are required to assure that the fund does not invest more than  or  in the case of global growth and income fund of its assets in illiquid securities investing in rule a securities could have the effect of increasing the amount of the funds assets invested in illiquid securities if qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to purchase such securities  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th foreign securities global growth and income fund may invest all of its net assets and each other fund may invest up to  of its net assets in securities of foreign issuers for this purpose foreign securities do not include american depositary receipts adrs or securities guaranteed by a united states person but may include foreign securities in the form of european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs or other securities representing underlying shares of foreign issuers positions in those securities are not necessarily denominated in the same currency as the common stocks into which they may be converted adrs are receipts typically issued by an american bank or trust company evidencing ownership of the underlying securities edrs are european receipts listed on the luxembourg stock exchange evidencing a similar arrangement gdrs are us dollardenominated receipts issued by international banks evidencing ownership of foreign securities generally adrs in registered form are designed for the us securities markets and edrs and gdrs in bearer form are designed for use in foreign securities markets each fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored adrs in the case of an unsponsored adr the fund is likely to bear its proportionate share of the expenses of the depository and it may have greater difficulty in receiving shareholder communications than it would have with a sponsored adr to the extent positions in portfolio securities are denominated in foreign currencies a funds investment performance is affected by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar against those currencies for example if the dollar falls in value relative to the japanese yen the dollar value of a japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged conversely if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen the dollar value of the japanese stock will fall see discussion of transaction hedging and portfolio hedging below under currency exchange transactions investors should understand and consider carefully the risks involved in foreign investing investing in foreign securities which are generally denominated in foreign currencies and utilization of forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain considerations comprising both risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in us securities these considerations include fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies possible imposition of exchange control regulation or currency restrictions that would prevent cash from being brought back to the united states less public information with respect to issuers of securities less governmental supervision of stock exchanges securities brokers and issuers of securities lack of uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards lack of uniform settlement periods and trading practices less liquidity and frequently greater price volatility in foreign markets than in the united states possible imposition of foreign taxes and sometimes less advantageous legal operational and financial protections applicable to foreign subcustodial arrangements although the funds intend to invest in companies and government securities of countries having stable political environments there is the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation seizure or nationalization of foreign bank deposits or other assets establishment of exchange controls the adoption of foreign government restrictions or other adverse political social or diplomatic developments that could affect investment in these nations  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th each fund other than global growth and income fund expects that substantially all of its foreign investments will be in developed nations however each fund may invest in the securities of emerging countries the securities markets of emerging countries are substantially smaller less developed less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets of the us and other more developed countries disclosure and regulatory standards in many respects are less stringent than in the us and other major markets there also may be a lower level of monitoring and regulation of emerging markets and the activities of investors in such markets and enforcement of existing regulations has been extremely limited economies in individual emerging markets may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross domestic product rates of inflation currency depreciation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments positions many emerging market countries have experienced high rates of inflation for many years which has had and may continue to have very negative effects on the economies and securities markets of those countries currency exchange transactions currency exchange transactions may be conducted either on a spot ie cash basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling currency prevailing in the foreign exchange market or through forward currency exchange contracts forward contracts forward contracts are contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specified currency at a specified future date or within a specified time period and price set at the time of the contract forward contracts are usually entered into with banks foreign exchange dealers and brokerdealers are not exchange traded and are usually for less than one year but may be renewed forward currency exchange transactions may involve currencies of the different countries in which the funds may invest and serve as hedges against possible variations in the exchange rate between these currencies currency exchange transactions are limited to transaction hedging and portfolio hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions except to the extent described below under synthetic foreign money market positions transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward contracts with respect to specific receivables or payables of a fund accruing in connection with the purchase and sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of dividends or interest thereon portfolio hedging is the use of forward contracts with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in a particular foreign currency portfolio hedging allows a fund to limit or reduce its exposure in a foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to sell such foreign currency or another foreign currency that acts as a proxy for that currency at a future date for a price payable in us dollars so that the value of the foreign denominated portfolio securities can be approximately matched by a foreign denominated liability a fund may not engage in portfolio hedging with respect to the currency of a particular country to an extent greater than the aggregate market value at the time of making such sale of the securities held in its portfolio denominated or quoted in that particular currency except that the fund may hedge all or part of its foreign currency exposure through the use of a basket of currencies or a proxy currency where such currencies or currency act as an effective proxy for other currencies in such a case the fund may enter into a forward contract where the amount of the foreign currency to be sold exceeds the value of the securities denominated in such currency the use of this basket hedging technique may be more efficient  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th and economical than entering into separate forward contracts for each currency held in the fund no fund may engage in speculative currency exchange transactions if a fund enters into a forward contract the funds custodian will segregate liquid assets of the fund having a value equal to the funds commitment under such forward contract at the maturity of the forward contract to deliver a particular currency the fund may either sell the portfolio security related to the contract and make delivery of the currency or it may retain the security and either acquire the currency on the spot market or terminate its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing an offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it to purchase on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency it is impossible to forecast with absolute precision the market value of portfolio securities at the expiration of a forward contract accordingly it may be necessary for a fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market and bear the expense of such purchase if the market value of the security is less than the amount of currency the fund is obligated to deliver and if a decision is made to sell the security and make delivery of the currency conversely it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the currency received upon the sale of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the amount of currency the fund is obligated to deliver if a fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting currency transaction the fund will incur a gain or a loss to the extent that there has been movement in forward contract prices if the fund engages in an offsetting currency transaction it may subsequently enter into a new forward contract to sell the currency should forward prices decline during the period between the funds entering into a forward contract for the sale of a currency and the date it enters into an offsetting contract for the purchase of the currency the fund will realize a gain to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to sell exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase should forward prices increase the fund will suffer a loss to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to sell a default on the contract would deprive the fund of unrealized profits or force the fund to cover its commitments for purchase or sale of currency if any at the current market price hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines hedging transactions also preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the hedged currency should rise moreover it may not be possible for a fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates the cost to a fund of engaging in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as the currency involved the length of the contract period and prevailing market conditions because currency exchange transactions are usually conducted on a principal basis no fees or commissions are involved synthetic foreign money market positions each fund may invest in money market instruments denominated in foreign currencies in addition to or in lieu of such direct investment a fund may construct a synthetic foreign money market position by a purchasing a money market instrument denominated in one currency generally us dollars and b concurrently entering into a forward contract to deliver  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a corresponding amount of that currency in exchange for a different currency on a future date and at a specified rate of exchange for example a synthetic money market position in japanese yen could be constructed by purchasing a us dollar money market instrument and entering concurrently into a forward contract to deliver a corresponding amount of us dollars in exchange for japanese yen on a specified date and at a specified rate of exchange because of the availability of a variety of highly liquid shortterm us dollar money market instruments a synthetic money market position utilizing such us dollar instruments may offer greater liquidity than direct investment in foreign currency and a concurrent construction of a synthetic position in such foreign currency in terms of both income yield and gain or loss from changes in currency exchange rates in general should be similar but would not be identical because the components of the alternative investments would not be identical swaps caps floors and collars each fund may enter into interest rate currency index credit default and other swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps floors and collars each fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio to protect against currency fluctuations as a duration management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of securities the fund anticipates purchasing at a later date a fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the fund may be obligated to pay interest rate swaps involve the exchange by a fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest eg an exchange of floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal a currency swap is an agreement to exchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices a credit default swap is an agreement to transfer the credit exposure of fixed income products between parties the purchase of a cap entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount the purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or amount a collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values a fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis ie the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument with the fund receiving or paying as the case may be only the net amount of the two payments inasmuch as a fund will segregate assets or enter into offsetting positions to cover its obligations under swaps calamos advisors llc calamos advisors and the trust believe such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the investment company act of  and accordingly will not treat them as being subject to its borrowing restrictions a fund will not enter into any swap cap floor or collar transaction unless at the time of entering into such transaction the unsecured longterm debt of the securities dealers financial institutions or other parties with whom the fund has entered into such a transaction counterparties combined with any credit enhancements is rated at least a by sp or moodys or has an equivalent rating from a nrsro or is determined to be of equivalent credit quality by calamos advisors if there  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th is a default by the counterparty the fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction the swap market has grown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents utilizing standardized swap documentation as a result the swap market has become relatively liquid however some swaps may be considered illiquid caps floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully developed and accordingly they are less liquid than swaps structured products each fund may invest in interests in entities organized and operated for the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of certain other investments this type of restructuring involves the deposit with or purchase by an entity such as a corporation or trust of specified instruments and the issuance by that entity of one or more classes of securities structured products backed by or representing interests in the underlying instruments the term structured products as used herein excludes synthetic convertibles see investment practices  synthetic convertible securities the cash flow on the underlying instruments may be apportioned among the newly issued structured products to create securities with different investment characteristics such as varying maturities payment priorities and interest rate provisions and the extent of the payments made with respect to structured products is dependent on the extent of the cash flow on the underlying instruments a fund may invest in structured products which represent derived investment positions based on relationships among different markets or asset classes each fund may also invest in other types of structured products including among others baskets of credit default swaps referencing a portfolio of highyield securities a structured product may be considered to be leveraged to the extent its interest rate varies by a magnitude that exceeds the magnitude of the change in the index rate because they are linked to their underlying markets or securities investments in structured products generally are subject to greater volatility than an investment directly in the underlying market or security total return on the structured product is derived by linking return to one or more characteristics of the underlying instrument because certain structured products of the type in which a fund may invest may involve no credit enhancement the credit risk of those structured products generally would be equivalent to that of the underlying instruments a fund may invest in a class of structured products that is either subordinated or unsubordinated to the right of payment of another class subordinated structured products typically have higher yields and present greater risks than unsubordinated structured products although a funds purchase of subordinated structured products would have similar economic effect to that of borrowing against the underlying securities the purchase will not be deemed to be leverage for purposes of the funds limitations related to borrowing and leverage certain issuers of structured products may be deemed to be investment companies as defined in the investment company act of  as a result the funds investments in these structured products may be limited by the restrictions contained in the investment company act of  structured products are typically sold in private placement transactions and there currently may not be active trading market for structured products as a result certain structured products in which the fund invests may be deemed illiquid  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th lending of portfolio securities each fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokerdealers and banks any such loan must be continuously secured by collateral in cash or cash equivalents maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned by the fund the fund would continue to receive the equivalent of the interest or dividends paid by the issuer on the securities loaned and would also receive an additional return that may be in the form of a fixed fee or a percentage of the collateral the fund may pay reasonable fees to persons unaffiliated with the fund for services in arranging these loans the fund would have the right to call the loan and obtain the securities loaned at any time on notice of not more than five business days the fund would not have the right to vote the securities during the existence of the loan but could call the loan to permit voting of the securities in the event of bankruptcy or other default of the borrower the fund could experience both delays in liquidating the loan collateral or recovering the loaned securities and losses including a possible decline in the value of the collateral or in the value of the securities loaned during the period while the fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto b possible subnormal levels of income and lack of access to income during this period and c expenses of enforcing its rights in an effort to reduce these risks the investment adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the firms to which the fund lends securities repurchase agreements each fund may invest in repurchase agreements provided that global growth and income fund may not invest more than  and each other fund may not invest more than  of its net assets in repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days and any other illiquid securities a repurchase agreement is a sale of securities to the fund in which the seller agrees to repurchase the securities at a higher price which includes an amount representing interest on the purchase price within a specified time in the event of bankruptcy of the seller the fund could experience both losses and delays in liquidating its collateral options on securities indexes and currencies each fund may purchase and sell write put options and call options on securities indexes or foreign currencies a fund may purchase agreements sometimes called cash puts that may accompany the purchase of a new issue of bonds from a dealer a put option gives the purchaser of the option upon payment of a premium the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying security commodity index currency or other instrument at the exercise price for instance a funds purchase of a put option on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument or in some cases a similar instrument against a substantial decline in the market value by giving such fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price a call option upon payment of a premium gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy and the seller the obligation to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price a funds purchase of a call option on a security financial future index currency or other instrument might be intended to protect a fund against an increase

is authorized to purchase and sell write exchange listed options and overthecounter options otc options exchange listed options are issued by a regulated intermediary such as the options clearing corporation occ which guarantees the performance of the obligations of the parties to such options the discussion below uses the occ as an example but is also applicable to other financial intermediaries with certain exceptions occ issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security or currency although in the future cash settlement may become available index options and eurodollar instruments are cash settled for the net amount if any by which the option is inthemoney ie where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds in the case of a call option or is less than in the case of a put option the exercise price of the option at the time the option is exercised frequently rather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option listed options are closed by entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option otc options are purchased from or sold to counterparties through direct bilateral agreement with the counterparties in contrast to exchange listed options which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics all the terms of an otc option including such terms as method of settlement term exercise price premium guarantees and security are set by negotiation of the parties a fund will only sell write otc options other than otc currency options that are subject to a buyback provision permitting the fund to require the counterparty to sell the option back to the fund at a formula

commission the sec currently takes the position that otc options purchased by a fund and portfolio securities covering the amount of a funds obligation pursuant to an otc option sold by it or the amount of assets equal to the formula price for the repurchase of the option if any less the amount by which the option is in the money are illiquid and are subject to a funds limitation on investing no more than  of its net assets or  in the case of global growth and income fund in illiquid securities each fund may also purchase and sell write options on securities indices and other financial indices options on securities indices and other financial indices are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that rather than settling by physical delivery of the underlying instrument they settle by cash settlement ie an option or an index gives the holder the right to receive upon exercise of the option an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon which the option is based exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option except if in the case of an otc option physical delivery is specified this amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index over the exercise price of the option which also may be multiplied by a formula value the seller of the option is obligated in return for the premium received to make delivery of this amount the gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the instruments making upon the market market segment industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based rather than price movements in individual securities as is the case with respect to options on securities  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th a fund will sell write call options and put options only if they are covered for example a call option written by a fund will require such fund to hold the securities subject to the call or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional consideration or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised a call option sold by a fund on an index will require such fund to own portfolio securities that correlate with the index or to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise price on a current basis a put option written by a fund requires such fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price otc options entered into by a fund and occ issued and exchange listed index options will generally provide for cash settlement as a result when a fund sells writes these instruments it will only segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to its accrued net obligations as there is no requirement for payment or delivery of amounts in excess of the net amount these amounts will equal  of the exercise price in the case of a non cashsettled put the same as an occ guaranteed listed option sold by a fund or the inthemoney amount plus any sellback formula amount in the case of a cashsettled put or call in addition when a fund sells writes a call option on an index at a time when the inthemoney amount exceeds the exercise price such fund will segregate until the option expires or is closed out cash or cash equivalents equal in value to such excess occ issued and exchange listed options sold by a fund other than those above generally settle with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement and such fund will segregate an amount of cash or liquid assets equal to the full value of the option otc options settling with physical delivery or with an election of either physical delivery or cash settlement will be treated the same as other options settling with physical delivery if an option written by a fund expires such fund realizes a capital gain equal to the premium received at the time the option was written if an option purchased by a fund expires such fund realizes a capital loss equal to the premium paid a fund will realize a capital gain from a closing purchase transaction if the cost of the closing option is less than the premium received from writing the option or if it is more such fund will realize a capital loss if the premium received from a closing sale transaction is more than the premium paid to purchase the option a fund will realize a capital gain or if it is less such fund will realize a capital loss the principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand interest rates the current market price of the underlying security or index in relation to the exercise price of the option the volatility of the underlying security or index and the time remaining until the expiration date a put or call option purchased by a fund is an asset of such fund valued initially at the premium paid for the option the premium received for an option written by a fund is recorded as a deferred credit the value of an option purchased or written is markedtomarket daily and is valued at the closing price on the exchange on which it is traded or if not traded on an exchange or no closing price is available at the mean between the last bid and asked prices risks associated with options there are several risks associated with transactions in options for example there are significant differences between the securities markets the currency markets and the options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation among  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events the ability of a fund to utilize options successfully will depend on the investment advisers ability to predict pertinent market investments which cannot be assured a funds ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller writer of an occ or exchange listed put or call option is dependent in part upon the liquidity of the option market among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an exchange are i insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including reaching daily price limits iv interruption of the normal operations of the occ or an exchange v inadequacy of the facilities of an exchange or occ to handle current trading volume or vi a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the relevant market for that option on that exchange would cease to exist although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms if a fund were unable to close out an option that it has purchased on a security it would have to exercise the option in order to realize any profit or the option would expire and become worthless if a fund were unable to close out a covered call option that it had written on a security it would not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expired as the writer of a covered call option on a security a fund foregoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price of the call as the writer of a covered call option on a foreign currency a fund foregoes during the options life the opportunity to profit from currency appreciation the hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are traded to the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments significant price and rate movements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets unless the parties provide for it there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an otc option as a result if the counterparty as described above under options on securities indexes and currencies fails to make or take delivery of the security currency or other instrument underlying an otc option it has entered into with a fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in accordance with the terms of that option a fund will lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the transaction accordingly calamos advisors must assess the creditworthiness of each such counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the counterpartys credit to determine the likelihood that the terms of the otc option will be satisfied each fund may purchase and sell write call options on securities indices and currencies all calls sold by a fund must be covered even though a fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss a call sold by a fund exposes such fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require a fund to hold a security or instrument that it  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th might otherwise have sold each fund may purchase and sell write put options on securities indices and currencies in selling writing put options there is a risk that a fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price futures contracts and options on futures contracts each fund may use interest rate futures contracts index futures contracts volatility index futures contracts and foreign currency futures contracts an interest rate index volatility index or foreign currency futures contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified quantity of a financial instrument or the cash value of an index at a specified price and time a public market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes including but not limited to the standard  poors  index the russell  index the value line composite index and the new york stock exchange composite index as well as financial instruments including but not limited to us treasury bonds us treasury notes eurodollar certificates of deposit and foreign currencies other index and financial instrument futures contracts are available and it is expected that additional futures contracts will be developed and traded each fund may enter into such contract if in the investment advisers opinion such contract meets the investment parameters of the fund each fund may purchase and write call and put futures options futures options possess many of the same characteristics as options on securities indexes and foreign currencies discussed above a futures option gives the holder the right in return for the premium paid to assume a long position call or short position put in a futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option upon exercise of a call option the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned the opposite short position in the case of a put option the opposite is true the fund might for example use futures contracts to hedge against or gain exposure to fluctuations in the general level of stock prices anticipated changes in interest rates or currency fluctuations that might adversely affect either the value of the funds securities or the price of the securities that the fund intends to purchase although other techniques could be used to reduce or increase the funds exposure to stock price interest rate and currency fluctuations the fund may be able to achieve its desired exposure more effectively and perhaps at a lower cost by using futures contracts and futures options a fund will only enter into futures contracts and futures options that are standardized and traded on an exchange board of trade or similar entity or quoted on an automated quotation system the success of any futures transaction depends on the investment adviser correctly predicting changes in the level and direction of stock prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other factors should those predictions be incorrect the funds return might have been better had the transaction not been attempted however in the absence of the ability to use   a futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was originally written although the value of a securities index is a function of the value of certain specified securities no physical delivery of those securities is made  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th futures contracts the investment adviser might have taken portfolio actions in anticipation of the same market movements with similar investment results but presumably at greater transaction costs when a purchase or sale of a futures contract is made by a fund the fund is required to deposit with its custodian or broker if legally permitted a specified amount of cash or us government securities or other securities acceptable to the broker initial margin the margin required for a futures contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified during the term of the contract although a funds broker may require margin deposits in excess of the minimum required by the exchange the initial margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the futures contract which is returned to the fund upon termination of the contract assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied the fund expects to earn interest income on its initial margin deposits a futures contract held by the fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of the exchange on which it is traded each day the fund pays or receives cash called variation margin equal to the daily change in value of the futures contract this process is known as markingtomarket variation margin paid or received by the fund does not represent a borrowing or loan by the fund but is instead settlement between the fund and the broker of the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract had expired at the close of the previous day in computing daily net asset value the fund will marktomarket its open futures positions the fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin with respect to put and call options on futures contracts written by it such margin deposits will vary depending on the nature of the underlying futures contract and the related initial margin requirements the current market value of the option and other futures positions held by the fund although some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities usually these obligations are closed out prior to delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts same exchange underlying security or index and delivery month if an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price the fund engaging in the transaction realizes a capital gain or if it is more the fund realizes a capital loss conversely if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price the fund engaging in the transaction realizes a capital gain or if it is less the fund realizes a capital loss the transaction costs must also be included in these calculations risks associated with futures there are several risks associated with the use of futures contracts and futures options a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract in trying to increase or reduce market exposure there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures contract and in the portfolio exposure sought in addition there are significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between the markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives the degree of imperfection of correlation depends on circumstances such as variations in speculative market demand for futures futures options and the related securities including technical influences in futures and futures options trading and differences between the securities markets and the securities underlying the standard contracts available for trading for example in the case of index futures contracts the composition of the index including the  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th issuers and the weighing of each issue may differ from the composition of the funds portfolio and in the case of interest rate futures contracts the interest rate levels maturities and creditworthiness of the issues underlying the futures contract may differ from the financial instruments held in the funds portfolio a decision as to whether when and how to use futures contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected stock price or interest rate trends futures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day the daily limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous days settlement price at the end of the current trading session once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit the daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions for example futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses stock index futures contracts are not normally subject to such daily price change limitations there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a fund seeks to close out a futures or futures option position the fund would be exposed to possible loss on the position during the interval of inability to close and would continue to be required to meet margin requirements until the position is closed in addition many of the contracts discussed above are relatively new instruments without a significant trading history as a result there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or continue to exist limitations on options and futures if other options futures contracts or futures options of types other than those described herein are traded in the future a fund may also use those investment vehicles provided the board of trustees determines that their use is consistent with the funds investment objective a fund will not enter into a futures contract or purchase an option thereon if immediately thereafter the initial margin deposits for futures contracts held by the fund plus premiums paid by it for open futures option positions less the amount by which any such positions are inthemoney  would exceed  of the funds total assets   a call option is inthemoney to the extent if any that the value of the futures contract that is the subject of the option exceeds the exercise price a put option is inthemoney if the exercise price exceeds the value of the futures contract that is the subject of the option  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th when purchasing a futures contract or writing a put option on a futures contract a fund must maintain with its custodian or broker if legally permitted cash or cash equivalents including any margin equal to the market value of such contract when writing a call option on a futures contract the fund similarly will maintain with its custodian cash or cash equivalents including any margin equal to the amount by which such option is inthemoney until the option expires or is closed by the fund a fund may not maintain open short positions in futures contracts call options written on futures

and losses on the open positions adjusted for the historical relative volatility of the relationship between the portfolio and the positions for this purpose to the extent the fund has written call options on specific securities in its portfolio the value of those securities will be deducted from the current market value of the securities portfolio in order to comply with commodity futures trading commission cftc regulation  and thereby avoid being deemed a commodity pool operator a fund may use commodity futures or commodity options contracts for either risk management or speculative purposes without any limitation on the notional value of such positions the funds have qualified for an exemption from registration as commodity pool operators pursuant to cftc regulation  and therefore are not subject to registration or regulation under the commodity exchange act as amended taxation of options and futures if a fund exercises a call or put option that it holds the premium paid for the option is added to the cost basis of the security purchased call or deducted from the proceeds of the security sold put for cash settlement options and futures options exercised by the

delivers securities under a futures contract the fund also realizes a capital gain or loss on those securities for federal income tax purposes a fund generally is required to recognize as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses as of the end of the year on futures futures options and nonequity options positions yearend marktomarket generally any gain or loss recognized with respect to such positions either by yearend marktomarket or by actual closing of the positions is considered to be  longterm and  shortterm without regard to the holding periods of the contracts

and certain successor positions thereto may be deferred to a later taxable year sale of futures contracts or writing of call options or futures call options or buying put options or futures put options that are intended to hedge against a change in the value of securities held by the fund  will affect the holding period of the hedged securities and  may cause unrealized gain or loss on such securities to be recognized upon entry into the hedge if a fund were to enter into a short index future short index futures option or short index option position and the funds portfolio were deemed to mimic the performance of the index underlying such contract the option or futures contract position and the funds stock positions would be deemed to be positions in a mixed straddle subject to the abovementioned loss deferral rules in order for a fund to continue to qualify for federal income tax treatment as a regulated investment company at least  of its gross income for a taxable year must be derived from qualifying income ie dividends interest income derived from loans of securities and gains from the sale of securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures or forward contracts any net gain realized from futures or futures options contracts will be considered gain from the sale of securities and therefore be qualifying income for purposes of the  requirement each fund distributes to shareholders annually any net capital gains that have been recognized for federal income tax purposes including yearend marktomarket gains on options and futures transactions such distributions are combined with distributions of capital gains realized on the funds other investments and shareholders are advised of the nature of the payments warrants each fund may invest in warrants a warrant is a right to purchase common stock at a specific price usually at a premium above the market value of the underlying common stock at time of issuance during a specified period of time a warrant may have a life ranging from less  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd than a year to twenty years or longer but a warrant becomes worthless unless it is exercised or sold before expiration in addition if the market price of the common stock does not exceed the warrants exercise price during the life of the warrant the warrant will expire worthless warrants have no voting rights pay no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the corporation issuing them the percentage increase or decrease in the value of a warrant may be greater than the percentage increase or decrease in the value of the underlying common stock portfolio turnover although the funds do not purchase securities with a view to rapid turnover there are no limitations on the length of time that portfolio securities must be held portfolio turnover can occur for a number of reasons including calls for redemption general conditions in the securities markets more favorable investment opportunities in other securities or other factors relating to the desirability of holding or changing a portfolio investment the portfolio turnover rates may vary greatly from year to year a high rate of portfolio turnover in a fund would result in increased transaction expense which must be borne by that fund high portfolio turnover may also result in the realization of capital gains or losses and to the extent net shortterm capital gains are realized any distributions resulting from such gains will be considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes portfolio turnover for each fund is shown under financial highlights in the prospectus short sales each fund may attempt to hedge against market risk and to enhance income by selling short against the box that is  entering into short sales of securities that it currently has the right to acquire through the conversion or exchange of other securities that it owns or to a lesser extent entering into short sales of securities that it currently owns and  entering into arrangements with the brokerdealers through which such securities are sold short to receive income with respect to the proceeds of short sales during the period the funds short positions remain open each fund other than market neutral fund may make short sales of securities only if at all times when a short position is open the fund owns an equal amount of such securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for without payment of any further consideration securities of the same issue as and equal in amount to the securities sold short in addition to selling short against the box market neutral fund may sell short securities that it currently has the right to acquire upon payment of additional consideration for instance upon exercise of a warrant or option market neutral fund would use this technique to hedge against market risk in connection with a synthetic convertible security in the same way selling short against the box hedges against market risk in connection with a true convertible security in a short sale against the box a fund does not deliver from its portfolio the securities sold and does not receive immediately the proceeds from the short sale instead the fund borrows the securities sold short from a brokerdealer through which the short sale is executed and the brokerdealer delivers such securities on behalf of the fund to the purchaser of such securities such brokerdealer is entitled to retain the proceeds from the short sale until the fund delivers to such brokerdealer the securities sold short in addition the fund is required to pay to the brokerdealer the amount of any dividends paid on shares sold short finally to secure its  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd obligation to deliver to such brokerdealer the securities sold short the fund must deposit and continuously maintain in a separate account with the funds custodian an equivalent amount of the securities sold short or securities convertible into or exchangeable for such securities without the payment of additional consideration the fund is said to have a short position in the securities sold until it delivers to the brokerdealer the securities sold at which time the fund receives the proceeds of the sale because the fund ordinarily will want to continue to hold securities in its portfolio that are sold short the fund will normally close out a short position by purchasing on the open market and delivering to the brokerdealer an equal amount of the securities sold short rather than by delivering portfolio securities a short sale works the same way except that the fund places in the segregated account cash or us government securities equal in value to the difference between i the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were sold short and ii any cash or us government securities required to be deposited with the broker as collateral in addition so long as the short position is open the fund must adjust daily the value of the segregated account so that the amount deposited in it plus any amount deposited with the broker as collateral will equal the current market value of the security sold short however the value of the segregated account may not be reduced below the point at which the segregated account plus any amount deposited with the broker is equal to the market value of the securities sold short at the time they were sold short market neutral fund will conduct its short sales so that no more than  of the net assets of the fund when added together will be i deposited with brokers as collateral and ii allocated to segregated accounts in connection with short sales at any time short sales may protect a fund against the risk of losses in the value of its portfolio securities because any unrealized losses with respect to such portfolio securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding gain in the short position however any potential gains in such portfolio securities should be wholly or partially offset by a corresponding loss in the short position the extent to which such gains or losses are offset will depend upon the amount of securities sold short relative to the amount the fund owns either directly or indirectly and in the case where the fund owns convertible securities changes in the conversion premium short sale transactions of a fund involve certain risks in particular the imperfect correlation between the price movements of the convertible securities and the price movements of the underlying common stock being sold short creates the possibility that losses on the short sale hedge position may be greater than gains in the value of the portfolio securities being hedged in addition to the extent that a fund pays a conversion premium for a convertible security the fund is generally unable to protect against a loss of such premium pursuant to a short sale hedge in determining the number of shares to be sold short against a funds position in the convertible securities the anticipated fluctuation in the conversion premiums is considered a fund will also incur transaction costs in connection with short sales certain provisions of the code may limit the degree to which the fund is able to enter into short sales which limitations might impair the funds ability to achieve its investment objective see taxation  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th in addition to enabling a fund to hedge against market risk short sales may afford a fund an opportunity to earn additional current income to the extent the fund is able to enter into arrangements with brokerdealers through which the short sales are executed to receive income with respect to the proceeds of the short sales during the period the funds short positions remain open the code imposes constructive sale treatment for federal income tax purposes on certain hedging strategies with respect to appreciated securities under these rules taxpayers will recognize gain but not loss with respect to securities if they enter into short sales or offsetting notional principal contracts as defined by the act or futures or forward contracts as defined by the act with respect to the same or substantially identical property or if they enter into such transactions and then acquire the same or substantially identical property the secretary of the treasury is authorized to promulgate regulations that will treat as constructive sales certain transactions that have substantially the same effect as short sales whenissued and delayed delivery securities and reverse repurchase agreements each fund may purchase securities on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis although the payment and interest terms of these securities are established at the time the fund enters into the commitment the securities may be delivered and paid for a month or more after the date of purchase when their value may have changed the fund makes such commitments only with the intention of actually acquiring the securities but may sell the securities before settlement date if calamos advisors deems it advisable for investment reasons the fund may utilize spot and forward foreign currency exchange transactions to reduce the risk inherent in fluctuations in the exchange rate between one currency and another when securities are purchased or sold on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis each fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and securities dealers a reverse repurchase agreement is a repurchase agreement in which the fund is the seller of rather than the investor in securities and agrees to repurchase them at an agreedupon time and price use of a reverse repurchase agreement may be preferable to a regular sale and later repurchase of securities because it avoids certain market risks and transaction costs at the time when a fund enters into a binding obligation to purchase securities on a whenissued basis or enters into a reverse repurchase agreement liquid assets cash us government securities or other highgrade debt obligations of the fund having a value at least as great as the purchase price of the securities to be purchased will be segregated on the books of the fund and held by the custodian throughout the period of the

agreement arises when a fund purchases a security and simultaneously agrees to resell it to the vendor at an agreed upon future date the resale price is greater than the purchase price reflecting an agreed upon market rate of return that is effective for the period of time the fund holds the security and that is not related to the coupon rate on the purchased security such agreements generally

trust has adopted a deferred compensation plan the plan under the plan a trustee who is not an interested person of calamos advisors and has elected to participate in the plan a participating trustee may defer receipt of all or a portion of his compensation from the trust to defer payment of income taxes or for other reasons the deferred compensation payable to the participating trustee is credited to the trustees deferral account as of the business day such compensation would have been paid to the trustee the value of a trustees deferred compensation account at any time is equal to what would be the value if the amounts credited to the account had instead been invested in shares of one or more of the funds of the trust as designated by the trustee thus the value of the account increases with contributions to the account or with increases in the value of the measuring shares and the value of the account decreases with withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the measuring shares if a participating trustee retires the trustee may elect to receive payments under the plan in a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a period of five years if a participating trustee dies any amount payable under the plan will be paid to the trustees beneficiaries each funds obligation to make payments under the plan is a general obligation of that fund no fund is liable for any other funds obligations to make payments under the plan code of ethics employees of calamos advisors and cfs are permitted to make personal securities transactions including transactions in securities that the trust may purchase sell or hold subject to requirements and restrictions set forth in the code of ethics of the trust calamos advisors and cfs the code of ethics contains provisions and requirements designed to identify and address certain conflicts of interest between personal investment activities of calamos advisors and cfs employees and the interests of investment advisory clients such as the trust among other things the code of ethics prohibits certain types of transactions absent prior approval imposes time periods during which personal transactions may not be made in certain securities and requires the submission of duplicate broker confirmations and statements and quarterly reporting of securities transactions additional restrictions apply to portfolio managers traders research analysts and others involved in the investment advisory process exceptions to these and other provisions of the code of ethics may be granted in particular circumstances after review by appropriate personnel proxy voting procedures each fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to calamos advisors subject to the board of trustees general oversight each fund expects calamos advisors to vote proxies related to that funds portfolio securities for which the fund has voting authority consistent with the funds best economic interests calamos advisors has adopted its own proxy voting policies and procedures policies the policies address among other things conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the funds and the interests of the adviser and its affiliates the following is a summary of the policies used by calamos advisors in voting proxies to assist it in voting proxies calamos advisors has established a committee comprised of members of its portfolio management and research departments the committee andor its members will vote proxies using the following guidelines in general if calamos advisors believes that a companys management and board have interests sufficiently aligned with the funds interest calamos advisors will vote in favor of  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd proposals recommended by a companys board more specifically calamos advisors seeks to ensure that the board of directors of a company is sufficiently aligned with security holders interests and provides proper oversight of the companys management in many cases this may be best accomplished by having a majority of independent board members although calamos advisors will examine board member elections on a casebycase basis it will generally vote for the election of directors that would result in a board comprised of a majority of independent directors because of the enormous variety and complexity of transactions that are presented to shareholders such as mergers acquisitions reincorporations adoptions of antitakeover measures including adoption of a shareholder rights plan requiring supermajority voting on particular issues adoption of fair price provisions issuance of blank check preferred stocks and the creation of a separate class of stock with unequal voting rights changes to capital structures including authorizing additional shares repurchasing stock or approving a stock split executive compensation and option plans that occur in a variety of industries companies and market cycles it is extremely difficult to foresee exactly what would be in the best interests of the fund in all circumstances moreover voting on such proposals involves considerations unique to each transaction accordingly calamos advisors will vote on a casebycase basis on proposals presenting these transactions finally calamos advisors has established procedures to help resolve conflicts of interests that might arise when voting proxies for the funds these procedures provide that the committee along with calamos advisors legal and compliance departments will examine conflicts of interests with the fund of which calamos advisors is aware and seek to resolve such conflicts in the best interests of the fund irrespective of any such conflict if a member of the committee has a personal conflict of interest that member will refrain from voting and the remainder of the committee will determine how to vote the proxy solely on the investment merits of any proposal the committee will then memorialize the conflict and the procedures used to address the conflict you may obtain a copy of calamos advisors policies by calling   by visiting the funds website at wwwcalamoscom by

and appropriate to meet redemptions and to take advantage of buying opportunities without having to make unwarranted liquidations of portfolio securities the board also considered that continuing growth in the size of the funds would be in the best interests of shareholders because increased size would allow the funds to realize certain economies of scale in their operations and would likely reduce the proportionate share of expenses borne by each shareholder the board of trustees therefore determined that it would benefit each of the funds to have monies available for the direct distribution and service activities of cfs as the funds distributor in promoting the continuous sale of the funds shares the board of trustees including the noninterested trustees concluded in the

detailed explanation of the tax treatment of the funds or their shareholders and the discussion here is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning investors are urged to consult their tax advisers with specific reference to their own tax situations at the time of your purchase a funds net asset value may reflect undistributed income capital gains or net unrealized appreciation of securities held by that fund a subsequent distribution to you of such amounts although constituting a return of your investment would be taxable either as a dividend or capital gain distribution some of the funds investment practices are subject to special provisions of the code that among other things may i disallow suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions ii convert lower taxed longterm capital gain into higher taxed shortterm capital gain or ordinary income iii convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss the deductibility of which is more limited andor iv cause a fund to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the  distribution requirement and the distribution requirements for avoiding income and excise taxes the funds will monitor their transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these rules and prevent disqualification of the funds as a regulated investment companies a fund is permitted to invest in securities issued or purchased at a discount tax rules could require a fund to accrue and distribute income not yet received depending upon particular circumstances this treatment may also affect the tax character and amount of income required to be recognized by the fund holding the security a fund could be required to sell securities in its portfolio that it otherwise might have continued to hold in order to generate sufficient cash to make these distributions foreign currency gains and losses including the portion of gain or loss on the sale of debt securities attributable to foreign exchange rate fluctuations are taxable as ordinary income if the net effect to a fund of those transactions is a gain the income dividend paid by the fund will be increased if the result is a loss the income dividend paid will be decreased income received by a fund from sources within various foreign countries will be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source under the code if more than  of the value of a funds total assets at the close of its taxable year comprises securities issued by foreign corporations the fund may file an election with the internal revenue service to pass through to its shareholders the amount of foreign income taxes paid by that fund pursuant to that election shareholders would be required to i include in gross income even though not actually received their respective pro rata share of foreign taxes paid by the fund ii treat their pro rata share of foreign taxes as paid by them and iii either deduct their pro rata share of foreign taxes in computing their taxable income or use it as a foreign tax credit against us income taxes but not both no deduction for foreign taxes may be claimed by a shareholder who does not itemize deductions  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th qualification as a regulated investment company each fund

all shares of each fund then outstanding were redesignated as class a shares of that fund under the terms of the agreement and declaration of trust the trustees may issue an unlimited number of shares

of the date of this statement of additional  prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd information the trust has eight series in operation all shares issued will be fully paid and nonassessable and will have no preemptive or conversion rights in the future the board of trustees may authorize the issuance of shares of additional series and additional classes of shares of any series each funds shares of a given class are entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends and other distributions declared by the funds board of trustees with respect to shares of the fund all shares of the fund of a given class have equal rights in the event of liquidation of that class under massachusetts law the shareholders of the trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable for the trusts obligations however the trusts declaration of trust disclaims liability of the shareholders trustees and officers of the trust for acts or obligations of the funds that are binding only on the assets and property of the fund the declaration of trust requires that notice of such disclaimer be given in each agreement obligation or contract entered into or executed by the trust or the board of trustees the declaration of trust provides for indemnification out of a funds assets of all losses and expenses of any fund shareholder held personally liable for the funds obligations thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is remote because it is limited to circumstances in which the disclaimer is inoperative and the fund itself is unable to meet its obligations voting rights each share has one vote and fractional shares have fractional votes as a business trust the trust is not required to hold annual shareholder meetings however special

bond ratings a rating of a rating service represents the services opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer consequently calamos advisors believes that the quality of debt securities in which a fund invests should be continuously reviewed a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating should be evaluated independently ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources that they consider reliable ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons the following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by moodys investors service inc moodys and standard  poors corporation a division of the mcgrawhill companies sp moodys ratings aaabonds rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as giltedged interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure although the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such bonds aabonds rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that make the long term risk appear somewhat larger than in aaa bonds abonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper mediumgrade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds rated baa are considered as mediumgrade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well babonds rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class a plast�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th bbonds rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small caabonds rated caa are of poor standing such bonds may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest cabonds rated ca represent obligations that are speculative in a high degree such bonds are often in default or have other marked shortcomings sp ratings aaabonds rated aaa have the highest rating the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is extremely strong aabonds rated aa differ from aaa bonds only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is very strong abonds rated a are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the bond is still strong bbbbonds rated bbb exhibit adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the bond bbbccccc and cbonds rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the lowest degree of speculation among such bonds and c the highest degree of speculation while such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions a rdates referenced herein � and � documents
