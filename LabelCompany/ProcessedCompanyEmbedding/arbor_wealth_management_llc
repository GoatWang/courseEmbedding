newsletter email address  asset management income generation financial planning income generation – arbor wealth management arbor wealth management llc asset management income generation financial planning income generation   many of our clients desire that their investments generate income this is particularly important during retirement income generation which is achieved through stock dividends and bond yields has been a specialty of our firm for many years we total your monthly income from all sources and then subtract that number from the amount that you need to live each month that then is the amount that becomes our monthly income generation target figure of course your total return is our primary objective in addition to your income generation goals income generation and growth are not mutually exclusive we endeavor to continue growing your assets while you are getting paid each month from your investments we can ladder the dividends and yields so that they are electronically deposited each month on any day of your choosing into your personal checking or savings account these dividendyields are periodic and systematic and represent what many come to rely on as “retirement paycheck” some clients are able to cover all their living expenses through their investment income and leave their principal untouched with the objective of continued growth income generation faqs question  how do you choose the investments within my portfolio that generate income answer not all investments within your portfolio will provide income but we lean heavily on those that will we look for companies whose share price has appreciated over time and who have a history of increasing their dividend payouts to shareholders these increasing dividend payouts represent a solid hedge against inflation which is especially important in retirement we carefully select companies to build a welldiversified portfolio that spanning industry sectors in an effort to minimize risk question  will all the income generating securities you choose be stocks or will there be some bonds as well answer we will build your customcreated portfolio with your age risk tolerance and financial objectives in mind each portfolio is different generally we like a mixture of equities and fixed income instruments question  how will i receive the dividend payments and bond yields  how often will i be paid answer we will set up a link directly to your checking or savings account and the dividendsyields will be deposited each month electronically on the date of your choosing some dividends pay monthly some quarterly and some semiannually but we will ladder the payouts so that you are receiving a periodic systematic stream of income in an amount that you can count on each month on the same date it’s like a “retirement paycheck” question  can you tell me how much income you can generate for me each month answer normally based on your account balance and risk tolerance we can estimate in advance pretty closely what can be generated question   is it possible to live off my dividend payments answer yes depending on your cash flow needs and if the account balance is large enough this is the ideal scenario for many retirees for a couple of reasons  their principal remains untouched while we endeavor to continue growing it and the majority of their income through investments is taxed at the capital gains rate rather than at the ordinary income rate     investment team – arbor wealth management arbor wealth management llc asset management income generation

hard earned savings learn more did you know the two most common money mistakes made by the retirementminded are putting all of their retirement assets in shortterm savings solutions if you have your retirement money in places that allow you immediate or unlimited access you’re paying a dear price for liquidity not all of your retirement money will be needed at the same time therefore you may need to space your investments so they come due when needed yet retain enough flexibility to take care of an emergency should one arise unknowingly taking risks they can’t afford far too many people have all their retirement money in the “market” and exposed to the risk of principal loss certainly some of your money needs to be in shortterm places that give you access without penalty some may be able to afford the risk of the market with some of their retirement money but too much in either place could cost you where to put your money there is no one “best place” to put your retirement money because each individual and couple has unique requirements different tolerances for risk and different needs at different times likewise there is no one place to keep your money that fits everyone for
