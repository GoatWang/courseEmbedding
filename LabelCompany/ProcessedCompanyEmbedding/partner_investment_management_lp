which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals asset management a more complete approach to asset allocation we analyze a wide range of asset classes including hedge and private equity funds and global investment opportunities as potential components of an asset allocation in addition we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid your asset allocation will be based on the longterm expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals over the shorter term however your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks and reflecting us trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you how you own your assets — personally or in trusts in taxable or taxexempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall

participants we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange interest rate commodity and equity markets derivativebased transactions target the risks you seek to hedge and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies  asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets  alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral properties and timber farm and ranch land are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value special risk considerations include natural events for example earthquakes or fires
