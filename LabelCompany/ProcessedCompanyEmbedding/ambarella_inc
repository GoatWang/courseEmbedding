foolcom foolcouk foolcomau foolca foolsg foolde helping the world invest better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search how ambarella inc turns its patented chips into gold find out how strong patents and pricing power set this chip supplier apart from the competition frank dipietro cmffrankdip jan   at pm one of the key ways to find a winning investment is to seek out a company with pricing power the ability to charge a premium price for ones products can lead to higher profit margins  and in many cases a higher stock price ambarella nasdaqamba consistently delivers quarterly gross profit margins in the mid range heres how the chip supplier does it image source ambarella approximately  of ambarellas  employees are classified as research and development rd personnel these employees are essential to the creation of semiconductor systemsonachip socs that the company uses to dominate the highdefinition video processing marketplace customers utilize ambarellas socs in various applications including action cams wearable body cameras ip security automobile dashboard cameras and drones ambarellas secret sauce ambarella chips are unique in that they have properties the competition has been unable to match this allows the company to be a singlesource supplier to its customers key features such as low power consumption or the ability to operate in low ambient light conditions give ambarella products a price premium as well customers then turn these features into advantages for products they sell to end users and similarly charge a higher price for superior performance  looking at ambarellas patent activity is a clue to its success below is a table showing the number of patents granted to the company by year   patents granted          data source patentbuddy chart by author these patents create a moat around some of the exclusive designs that power the key advantages ambarella products offer to customers featureadvantagebenefit low power consumption longer battery life more video per charge wideangle view capture more peripheral image a more complete image low ambient light better image quality at night higher surveillance capability efficient video compression faster capture to the cloud more efficient transmission and storage of video data source ambarella  key features lead to higher gross margins when we compare ambarella to other semiconductor companies its  nongaap gross margin stands out from the crowd  yet another sign of the pricing power it can enjoy due to the irreplaceable nature of its technology source ycharts invensense has  employees of which  are in rd it operates in more of a commoditytype business thus having to compete on price to win design sockets in customer applications as a result invensense has a much lower gross margin for the products it sells although both companies are fabless semiconductor companies one clearly provides a unique product that is more profitable than the other a company such as ambarella forms deep ties with its customers helping fulfill design needs for future products evidence of the partnering is reflected in comments from last quarters earnings report stating that  although not material of late  ambarella engages in marginsharing arrangements with one or more of its customers predicated on the customers product margin where the socs are used in other words ambarella can get more money if its customer sells the final product to end users at a higher price this may happen when the customer believes they can charge more for a product based on any competitive advantages offered by ambarellas chips   piling up the cash source ycharts  from an investors perspective when we find a company with pricing power it can be wise to invest and allow time to be your friend although ambarellas stock price has been volatile at times it continues to add cash to its balance sheet on a quarterly basis and in the longterm may well wind up rewarding the patient investor all too often we tend to sell too early in a companys life cycle failing to let the story play out as long as ambarella can outperform competitors with its chips the company will continue to dominate its space and that should mean more cash pouring onto the balance sheet just keep your eye on gross margins staying in the mid range and watch for cash flows to remain strong frank dipietro owns shares of ambarella the motley fool owns shares of and recommends ambarella the motley fool owns shares of invensense the motley fool has a disclosure policy

need to watch when ambarella inc reports fiscal  earnings the company is set to introduce a product in mid that may unshackle its stock from gopros misfortune frank dipietro cmffrankdip feb   at am ambarella nasdaqamba will report fiscal  fourth quarter earnings after the market close on feb  as investors sift through the company results there are two key updates from the management team that i will be watching most closely the relationship with gopro and new autonomous driving solutions first here are the headline numbers from the companys guidance and the analyst estimates metriccompany guidance at midpointanalyst consensus estimate revenue  million  million earnings per share   data source ambarella and sp capital iq chart by author anchored to gopros sinking ship ambarella has suffered due its ties to gopro the companys largest customer last fiscal year it accounted for  of ambarellas top line and management projected that gopro will account for  of revenue for fiscal year  all things being equal if ambarella can show consistent revenue growth each quarter while gopro becomes a smaller and smaller portion of total revenue investors will be less inclined to punish ambarella every time the action cam maker issues downward guidance or misses analyst estimates look out for any management guidance that shows reduced ties to gopro in fiscal year  plans for autonomous vehicles image source vislab in a recent article i outlined ambarellas  million acquisition of a private company in italy called vislab that company consisted of  engineers who created an autonomous driving solution that was successfully navigated a vehicle from italy to china last november the prime minister of italy met with vislab and ambarella representatives where he was able to experience firsthand some of their technology during the latest earnings call ambarella ceo fermi wang described the progress the company has made in the autonomous vehicle space ambarella is continuing to invest heavily in computer vision development building upon the pioneering computer vision and autonomous vehicle work done by our combined ambarella and the vislab teams we remain on track to ship out first computer vision chip in the beginning of next year and on nov  italian prime minister matteo renzi visited vislab citing them as an example of a successful italian startup with a strong vision and solid execution mr renzi reached the facility in parma on board vislabs latest vehicle prototype driving in autonomous mode together with alberto broggi ambarellas italian general manager mr renzi was impressed by the smoothness of the ride and commented positively on a vision that vislab has developed in the past twenty years  at the needham conference in january wang also discussed company efforts around an soc for the autonomous driving market and specifically how it would compare to mobileyes product he indicated that vislab had developed a complete software stack that would be used by ambarella and he did not want to give further guidance as the product had not yet been introduced the offering will be ambarellas first generation computer vision soc called cv and is expected to be available in mid  ambarella initially entered the auto industry by providing socs to aftermarket dashboard camera manufacturers more recent products have the company dealing directly with oems such as gentex corporation which supplies the auto industry with products that are designed into new vehicles ambarellas latest automotive product is a multicamera electronic mirror and surround view soc which has passed automotive aecq reliability testing   a foolish lesson it pays to listen to a companys earnings call as the discussion will often reveal important details that may not be reflected in the headline numbers in the case of ambarella updates regarding its upcoming products for selfdriving cars will be my no  priority this could be a tremendous opportunity for the company and would help it reduce its association with gopro putting ambarella itself in the drivers seat and giving investors a whole new perspective on the companys outlook for future growth
