ceo jan van eck discusses a history of product innovation interview highlights can you tell us about your firm ’ s history with gold whenhow did it begin vaneck launched its first gold fund in  it really came out of a concern for rising monetary supply and the threat of inflation for the  ’ s it worked out tremendously well – as gold went from  to  in the  ’ s how many assets do you currently have in gold we manage about  billion dollars in gold share assets which are invested in gold mining companies and we also market a gold bullion fund which is about  million dollars if an investor wants to invest in gold or other hard commodities what vehicles are available we have several etfs g dx and gdxj and ounz  and they ’ re all listed on the new york stock exchange gdx is based on a traditional gold miner ’ s index gdxj is based on a small cap gold miner ’ s index and ounz is gold bullion that ’ s actually deliverable when you want to redeem it those are the  most liquid vehicles available we also have an actively managed mutual fund vaneck international investor ’ s gold how has china ’ s economic slowdown affected commodities we ’ re very very bullish on commodities now the main reason is we think there ’ s been a huge shakeout in the supply of commodities it ’ s still happening in some of the metals areas but we think it ’ s already happened in oil and gold as long as economic growth is stable it doesn ’ t really need to accelerate we think commodities should be doing very well from here on out i understand that today ’ s bell ringing is not just a  year celebration of vaneck ’ s etf business as your firm just went through a rebrand could you tell us a little bit about the recent changes we ’ re very proud of our  year old history as a firm vaneck has been first in several asset classes – not just gold – but also early and emerging markets and china with some of our etf offerings our history is really one of innovation and we ’ re proud to be partners with the new york stock exchange to celebrate that we ’ ve tried to communicate it a little bit better by shortening our name just to vaneck and also by rebranding our etfs using the vaneck name now they ’ re called vaneck vector etfs in your opinion what ’ s next for etfs where do you see the etf business in  years a lot of exposuretype etfs have been launched accessing bonds and stock markets i think what investors are looking for is different kinds of risk exposures and it ’ s very very early days for that with the currency hedge products they want to tweak their exposure to different markets in an intelligent way you can call it smart beta but that ’ s the revolution that we ’ re in now lastly why did you choose the new york stock exchange as your listing venue for this fund it was easy in the early days we had no idea what we were doing the new york stock exchange was really helpful in educating us on the etf business as a partner they really helped us prepare for our listing and all of the things that were needed to have a successful etf launch the issuer has filed a registration statement with the sec for offering to which this communication relates before

fully insured to a delivery applicant by a conventional shipping carrier such as the us postal service federal express united parcel service or armored transportation service delivery applicants should be aware that the gold delivered is likely to represent a substantial us dollar value shipments may be broken down into multiple smaller shipments and possibly shipped on different days to meet insurance requirements of the shipping carrier a delivery applicant can utilize a shipping carrier only if insurance requirements can be met and the delivery applicant and we agree on an acceptable delivery destination a conventional shipping carrier may deliver gold to residential addresses armored transportation service will only deliver to certain trusted locations an armored transportation service does not deliver to residential addresses a delivery applicant can utilize an armored truck service only if the delivery applicant and the armored transportation service agree on an acceptable delivery destination london bars will only be transported using armored transportation service   delivery applicants should contact merk investments llc to discuss delivery method and location a delivery application may be declined if no delivery method and location is agreed upon when will i receive my gold   for coins and bars other than london bars delivery applications can be processed fastest when investors have their gold delivered to the address stated on their brokerage account this way gold coins and bars other than london bars may be delivered with ups next day delivery service to your home address specifically assuming shares have been accepted by the trustee on the share submission date merk will be notified of the successful share submission late that business day typically the next day merk will engage in an over the counter transaction with the precious metals dealer to facilitate an exchange of the trusts gold into coins and bars specified in the delivery application the completion of this exchange typically takes  business days this means gold coins and bars other than london bars might be handed over to ups for next day delivery on the third business day after a share submission allowing the delivery applicant to receive their gold on the fourth business day after share submission note that this timeline may be faster or slower in part due to the availability of the delivery applicant to receive packages   investors requesting london bars need to be aware that london bars are delivered with an armored transportation service that does not deliver to residential addresses armored transportation services only deliver to trusted addresses that means delivery applications can be processed faster when the delivery address is a familiar address such as a precious metals depository for new destinations a security survey first has to be conducted to ensure the safety of the crew and vehicle as our own testing has confirmed such surveys may only take a few business days however the delays that can be caused in this process lead us to state in the prospectus that it may take considerable time to take delivery of gold the legwork to agree on a suitable delivery location takes place before merk preapproves a delivery application a delivery application may be declined if no delivery method and location is agreed upon what is the exchange fee   the exchange fee covers the cost of exchanging ounz shares into gold bars in the form of london bars which the trust holds in the vault as well as the cost of converting london bars into the gold coins or smaller gold bars that investors may prefer for delivery the exchange fee for gold coins and bars outside of london bars reflects the premium such coins and bars are trading at relative to the spot price of gold all fees are subject to change upon notice we may waive or reduce the exchange fees from time to time is there a delivery fee   no delivery fee is charged for the delivery of physical gold to destinations in the lower  states there may be a delivery fee to alaska and hawaii as well as to countries outside of the united states this fee covers the cost of preparing and transporting physical gold from the custodian or the precious metals dealer to the location specified by a delivery applicant in its delivery application what is the processing fee   the processing fee is comprised of the exchange fee and the delivery fee   the processing fees must be wired by the delivery applicant at the time the delivery application is submitted the fee is fully reimbursable until the delivery applicant submits his or her shares to the trustee can my delivery application be denied   merk investments llc reserves the right to decline the delivery application
