domestic and international shipping options product description the life of dr frederick g williams counselor to the prophet joseph smith is a thoroughly researched documentary history of frederick g williams and his immediate family this book provides an intimate look at many significant events in the ohio missouri illinois and pioneer utah periods of church history frederick g williams was an important figure during the early days of the restoration of the gospel and the organization of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints he served as a missionary on the original mission to the lamanites participated in zions camp was second counselor in the first presidency for five years and for twelve years was the principal doctor for the saints in ohio missouri and illinois until his death in  about the authors byu studies no biography available view more products by byu studies frederick g williams no biography available view more products by frederick g williams reviews average rating based upon one review excellently researched book that demonstrates the significant contributions and faith of this veteran in the gospel by warren submitted on few are acquainted with joseph smiths second counselor in the fully organized original first presidency the few who have heard of him rarely know more than the lords admonition to put his house in order along with the entire first presidency or that he was labeled an apostate this book ably fills a gap in the collective memory of the latterday saints regarding a man who gave everything to the restored church and was a faithful friend to joseph smith there are documentary treasures about williams contribution to the existence and dedication of the kirtland temple including compelling evidence the temple was built on williams consecrated land and a very sacred spiritual experience it contains a biographical sketch of williams from joseph which he rarely gave and the attendant prophecy regarding williams it shows a man who was soft spoken particularly compared to his counterpart sydney rigdon the one fault joseph identified in williams was a lack of confidence in himself which would account for his failure to defend himself in the face of accusation one sees the curious dichotomy of joseph wishing to drop sydney for the millstone joseph described him as becoming but the saints voting him into the presidency and joseph calling for a sustaining vote of frederick but the saints voting him out in the record you find that only one branch of the church voted williams out of the first presidency in abstentia despite the vocal support of the likes of edward partridge one also sees the efforts of several including hyrum smith to reconcile competing branches votes and retain williams there is evidence of williams continued loyalty to the prophet and the church in the midst of accusations for example williams visits joseph at liberty jail just days before williams excommunication in abstentia for abandoning the saints conspicuously absent from the historical record is a public rebuke from joseph smith which joseph was not shy in giving where warranted also conspicuously absent is any public criticism of joseph by frederick there is a friendship and love between the men that leads joseph to name a son frederick granger williams smith the documents unfold a picture of a man whose shortcomings but dedication place him more in line with a temporarily befuddled parley p pratt than with the more hardened dissenters parley speaks of fredericks faithfulness in the church in which frederick died a faithful member two years before josephs martyrdom there are many more gems regarding the practice of law as a justice of the peace and medicine as the saints primary doctor in ohio missouri and illinois williams medical ledger is gem of its own as a whose who of members of the church receiving treatment here you see that joseph smith and frederick g williams signed the elders license of one of the first african american saints elijah abel one finds that the firm fg williams  co did not just print materials for the church but other entities in the community near kirtland this book identifies the extant documents and puts them in context in the interest of full disclosure i do share a kinship with both the author his subject so do not take my word for it see the documentary history for yourself on this early church church leader bh roberts calls a veteran in the faith i highly recommend this well researched book write a review recommendationsthe orphan
