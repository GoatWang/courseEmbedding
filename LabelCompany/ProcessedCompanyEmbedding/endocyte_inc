corporate profile endocyte is a biopharmaceutical company and leader in developing targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other serious diseases endocyte uses its proprietary drug conjugation technology to create novel smdcs and companion imaging agents for personalized targeted therapies the company’s smdcs actively target receptors that are overexpressed on diseased cells relative to healthy cells this targeted approach is designed to enable the treatment of patients with highly active drugs at greater doses delivered more frequently and over longer periods of time than would be possible with the untargeted drug alone the companion imaging agents are designed to identify patients whose disease overexpresses the target of the therapy and who are therefore more

potential indications partnering the endocyte drug development process precision medicine at work the endocyte drugdevelopment engine is designed with the goal of producing many precision drugs across disease categories our unique drug development process involves three steps designed to maximize development success and reduce clinical risk step  validate the target receptor our process begins by screening diseased cells for unique receptors after identifying a receptor we design a targeting ligand that binds with high affinity to the target receptor the targeting ligand is then attached to a radionuclide to create a companion imaging agent whose biologic activity can be viewed with widely available nuclear imaging equipment the companion imaging agent enables testing in preclinical animal models and humans to find out whether the smdc targets the diseased cells and not normal cells etarfolatide our folate receptor companion imaging agent has demonstrated targeting in cancer and other diseases step  build a pipeline of precision therapies once the targeting ligand has been validated in humans a variety of highly active therapeutic molecules are screened we look for highly active drugs with doselimiting toxicities after a drug is identified we attach it to the validated targeting ligand and compare it to the free drug in in vitro and in vivo models if the smdc is better than the free drug in terms of efficacy and safety it is advanced into the clinic by repeating this process for each drug we aim to build a pipeline of unique precision drugs with potentially superior safety and efficacy step  identify patients likely to respond the final step is to use companion imaging agents to identify patients likely to respond to a targeted therapy these companion imaging agents use the same targeting ligands and modular structure as the smdc and are incorporated into all of our clinical studies to determine whether each patient is an appropriate candidate for the
