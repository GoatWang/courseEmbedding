rates rise bond values generally fall in order to address interest rate sensitivity in a low rate environment many investors will reducing the average duration of their bond portfolios by moving to

for potential reboundsportable sigmawhen seeking diversification investors often favor using low risk investments to offset the higher volatility of stockcentric portfolios because of the lower volatility the low risk investments require a greater allocation percentage in order to achieve the desired level of diversification for a portfolio the idea of portable alpha is to use a lower

tactical element which can add an extra level of diversification rather than relying on a static  allocation to stocks and bonds the new  asks investors to consider blending a  mix of traditional assets with tactical and alternative strategiesthree legged stoolthis dorsey wright insights illustrates a portfolio management strategy known as the three legged stool which combines a core portfolio of tactical and alternative mutual funds with three active management strategiesvalue and momentummany investors believe that the way to diversify a valuebased strategy is to add a growth strategy however growth can contradict value adding growth has the risk of reducing the effectiveness of a value strategy in the first place this piece makes the case for using a momentum strategy such as
