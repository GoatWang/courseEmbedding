accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the companys annual financial statements for the year ended december   new standards and interpretations which became effective as of january   did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements     critical accounting estimates and judgments in the application of the companys accounting policies management is required to make judgments estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant actual results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods a sharebased payments share options granted to employees and consultants are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted fair value is determined through the use of the blackscholes optionpricing model which is considered the most appropriate model for this purpose by management initially the companys ordinary shares were not publicly traded and consequently the company needed to estimate the fair value of its share and the expected volatility of that value please refer to the companys annual financial statements for the year ended december   for the assumptions used in those estimates the value of the underlying shares was determined on the basis of the prior sale of company stock method as such the company has benchmarked the value per share to external transactions of company shares and external financing rounds for options granted on september   the company used the opening price of the companys stock on september   the first day of trading of the companys stock on the nasdag global market which amounted to us  as the value of its ordinary shares for all options granted subsequent to the initial public offering the company uses the closing price of the ordinary shares on the previous business day as the exercise price of the options granted the result of the share option valuations and the related compensation expense is dependent on the model and input parameters used even though management considers the fair values reasonable and defensible based on the methodologies applied and the information available others might derive a different fair value for the companys share options b corporate income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent that the company has sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilized managements judgment is that such convincing evidence is currently not sufficiently available and a deferred tax asset is therefore only recognized to the extent that the company has sufficient taxable temporary differences c research and development expenditures research expenditures are currently not capitalized but are reflected in the income statement because the criteria for capitalization are not met at each balance sheet date the company estimates the level of service performed by the vendors and the associated costs incurred for the services performed although we do not expect the estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred the understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in reporting amounts that vary in any particular period    the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all disclosures for critical accounting estimates and judgments that are required

financial information for the period ending december   please refer to the financial statements appearing at the end of this release corporate highlights in         in  just three andahalf years after its inception proqr started two global clinical studies of qr a novel investigational rna therapeutic designed to repair the genetic mutation in the mrna of cf patients due to the d f mutation the first study called pq is a global phase b clinical study that is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled day study being conducted in approximately  centers worldwide this firstinhuman study is evaluating the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of inhaled qr in  cf patients homozygous carrying two copies for the d f mutation as exploratory efficacy endpoints this study is also assessing sweat chloride weight gain cfqr respiratory symptom score and lung function measured by fev the study is not powered for statistical significance on these exploratory endpoints the second study called pq is a proofofconcept study evaluating the effect of qr on an important measurement of cftr function the nasal potential difference npd this proofofconcept study is a casecontrolled open label day study being conducted in  specialized centers in the us and europe the study plans to enroll  cf patients  homozygous carrying two copies for the d f mutation and  compound heterozygous one copy of the d f plus one other cf disease causing mutation with the option to enroll an additional  the npd assay selectively measures the activity of the impaired cftr protein in the nasal epithelium in cf patients restoration of npd to normal levels will demonstrate an important proof of the effect of qr on cftr function a benefit that has already been demonstrated in a mouse model with the d f mutation both study pq and pq are actively enrolling patients and topline results for both studies are expected mid to late         during the north american cystic fibrosis conference nacfc in october proqr presented encouraging preclinical data that shows qr is stable in cf mucus transits through the mucus in a clinically meaningful time is absorbed systemically after inhalation and is stable in the presence of commonly used inhaled medications dornase alfa pulmozyme ®  fluticasone and salbutamol in vitro qr was demonstrated to be stable in cf sputum and diffuse easily through in vitro cf mucus models using a mouse model with cflike lung phenotype it was shown that after inhalation qr is absorbed systemically and is delivered to extra pulmonary organs that are also compromised in cf        proqr progressed qr its second molecule into preclinical development for the indication of lebers congenital amaurosis lca due to the pcysx mutation in the cep gene lca is a rare disease without any known treatment and is the most common cause of genetic blindness in childhood qr is an rna oligonucleotide designed to repair the pcysx mutation in the cep mrna in lca patients preclinical data will be presented at the association for research in vision and ophthalmology arvo conference in may  the company is moving this program through preclinical development towards clinical studies in         over  proqr grew its in house discovery group strengthening its rna technologies and patent portfolio proqr announced that future programs amongst many others may include rna based oligonucleotides for the treatment of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa usher syndrome fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy fecd huntingtons disease friedreichs ataxia and alzheimers disease proqr will host an rd day for investors on march   in new york city and will highlight the efforts across the therapeutic areas of pulmonology ophthalmology dermatology and neurology        in  the company and its academic partners received a grant from the european union under the horizon  program the maximum amount of  million was granted to support the clinical development of qr proqr also received additional tranches totaling  million under the innovation credit program or innovatiekrediet by the dutch government through its agency rvo previously agentschapnl of the ministry of economic affairs for the cystic fibrosis development program        proqr strengthened its supervisory board with the appointment of paul baart in june  he is also the new chair of the audit committee paul was a former member of the global board at price waterhouse cooper international and is a renowned expert in accounting and finance      proqr opened an office in palo alto california this provides proqr the opportunity to build the company on a global scale subsequent events        james shannon md has been nominated to serve as a full member of the supervisory board to be appointed at the  annual general shareholders meeting james brings significant experience to the supervisory board through his extensive career in drug development and pharma from  until his retirement in  james was chief medical officer at glaxosmithkline prior to that he was global head of pharma development at novartis and senior vicepresident clinical development at sterling winthrop pharmaceuticals he held board positions at companies including biotie circassia crucell endocyte mannkind and cerimon pharmaceuticals he received his undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at queens university of belfast and is a member of the royal college of physicians uk the company believes james broad knowledge and expertise will be of significant value to the supervisory board about qr qr is a firstinclass rnabased oligonucleotide designed to address the underlying cause of the disease by repairing the mrna defect encoded by the d f mutation in the cftr gene of cf patients the d f mutation is a deletion of three of the coding base pairs or nucleotides in the cftr gene which results in the production of a misfolded cftr protein that does not function normally qr is designed to bind to the defective cftr mrna and guide the insertion of the three missing nucleotides thus repairing the mrna and subsequently producing wildtype or normal cftr protein qr is designed to be selfadministered through a small handheld aerosol delivery device or nebulizer in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs we believe this method could allow maximum exposure of qr to the primary target organ the lung as well as significant exposure to other affected organs through systemic absorption into the blood qr has been granted orphan drug designation in the united states and the european union the qr project has received funding from the european unions horizon  research and innovation programme under grant agreement no  about qr qr is a firstinclass oligonucleotide designed to address the underlying cause of lebers congenital amaurosis due to the pcysx mutation in the cep gene the pcysx mutation is a substitution of one nucleotide in the premrna that leads to aberrant splicing of the mrna and nonfunctional protein qr is designed to restore wildtype cep mrna leading to the production of wildtype cep protein by binding to the mutated location in the premrna causing normal splicing of the premrna qr is intended to be administered through intravitreal injections in the eye  annual reports the consolidated statement of

more about our discovery stage innovation programs innovation programs about the innovation unit we have identified five therapeutic areas that show high potential for rna based therapies including lung diseases eye diseases skin diseases central nervous system diseases and neuromuscular diseases we are employing our toolbox of rna technologies to target severe genetic diseases and grow the company’s pipeline beyond cystic fibrosis and leber’s congenital amaurosis the efforts in the innovation unit have resulted in the current pipeline including programs for usher syndrome fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa alzheimer’s disease huntington’s disease and friedreich’s ataxia lung diseases besides our qr program for cystic fibrosis cf caused by the fdel mutation we are working on other cftr mutations that can potentially be treated using our rna technologies we could potentially target an additional  of the cf population with these programs learn more about qr for cystic fibrosis eye diseases our ophthalmology group was founded on the basis that there are several severe genetic eye disorders that currently have very limited treatment options for which rna based therapeutics have the potential to make a large impact the eye is a well validated target for rna based therapies given the approved rna therapies for the eye their long halflives and potential for local delivery and therefore could be an important class of drugs for ophthalmic indications in the future besides the program in leber’s congenital amaurosis qr that is currently being prepared for first clinical studies we are working on programs for other ophthalmic indications including qrx for usher syndrome and qrx for fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy fecd learn more about qr for leber’s congenital amaurosis usher syndrome  qrx and qrx what is usher syndrome usher syndrome is the leading cause of combined deafness and blindness patients with this syndrome generally progress to a stage in which they have very limited central vision and moderate to severe deafness what causes usher syndrome usher syndrome type ii is most commonly caused by mutations or defects in a gene in the dna called the usha gene in the mutations we are targeting the genetic defect results in the lack of a functional usha protein similar to cep protein that we target in our qr program for leber’s congenital amaurosis the usha protein that is defective in usher syndrome type ii is responsible for the proper functioning of the light perceiving cells rods and cones in the retina treatment the moderate to severe deafness that patients experience with usher syndrome type ii is manageable with hearing aids or cochlear implants however there are currently no available treatment options for the vision loss associated with this disease our programs will target patients with mutations in usha with usher syndrome and nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa patients which experience visual loss but do not suffer from hearing loss about qrx with our qrx program we aim to treat the cag mutation in the usha gene that leads to vision loss our single stranded rna oligonucleotide aims to repair the genetic defect in the rna in the eye such that it leads to a normal “wildtype” mrna which then translates into normal protein thereby modifying the underlying disease about qrx our qrx program targets vision loss caused by defects in a specific part of the usha gene called exon  our single stranded rna oligonucleotide aims to repair the genetic defect in the rna in the eye such that it leads to the expression of a shortened but functional protein restoration thereby modifying the underlying disease fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy  qrx what is fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy fecd fecd is a common inherited condition characterized by the dysfunction and degeneration of the corneal endothelium a single cell layer on the inside of the cornea in the eye there are different types of this disease and we focus on agerelated fecd fecd some patients with agerelated fecd develop advanced disease with corneal edema and corneal clouding these symptoms can lead to complete vision loss and the need for surgery and a corneal transplant what causes fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy most of agerelated fecd is caused by a mutation or defect in the tcf gene treatment there are currently no other treatment options for any form of fecd patients with vision loss apart from corneal transplantation or replacement of the corneal endothelial layer this requires surgery where the damaged cornea is removed and replaced with a healthy donor cornea however transplantation has several limitations including the availability of donors risk of rejection the inherent risk of an invasive procedure and is only available to patients with advanced fecd about qrx our program qrx aims to prevent corneal dystrophy in patients with a mutation in the tcf gene by using a single stranded rna oligonucleotide skin diseases dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa  qr what is dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa deb deb is a severe genetic orphan disease that affects the connective tissues including the skin and mucosal tissues children with deb are often called ‘butterfly children’ due to their fragile skin blistering and skin erosions occur upon the slightest touch or even spontaneously symptoms include open wounds skin infections fusion of fingers and toes pseudosyndactyly gastrointestinal tract problems and eventually patients develop lethal squamous cell carcinoma what causes deb deb is caused by mutations or defects in a gene in the dna called the cola gene this gene is responsible for the formation of protein collagen type vii that forms anchoring fibrils that bind the different skin layers together the defects can occur in different parts of the cola gene causing loss or dysmalfunctioning of the anchoring fibrils and fragile skin treatment although there are treatment options that help the healing of wounds in deb patients there is no approved treatment available that target the underlying cause of for any type of deb about qrx our program qrx targets all deb caused by defects in a specific part of the cola gene called exon  by excluding this exon  from the rna that harbors the defect we hope to restore functionality of the anchoring fibrils central nervous system diseases in our cns group we are working on product candidates for several disease targets including qrx for alzheimer’s disease and qrx for huntington’s disease neuromuscular diseases within our neuromuscular group we are working on a program called qrx that aims to increase frataxin protein levels in people with friedreich’s ataxia

capital preservation investments which may include term deposits shortterm investmentgrade interestbearing instruments and government securities all in accordance with our investment policy the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies academic institutions government agencies and research institutions key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy safety and tolerability profile reliability convenience of dosing price and reimbursement many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates obtaining fda ema and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors accordingly our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining fda or ema approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance our competitors’ products may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses a number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of cf including vertex novartis pfizer genzyme which is a division of sanofi insmed targeted genetics bayer and several private companies of these vertex’s kalydeco is the only drug approved to treat an underlying cause of cf rather than the symptoms kalydeco was initially approved to treat cf patients with the gd mutation and in  kalydeco’s label was expanded to include eight additional gating mutations vertex has estimated that approximately  cf patients in the us europe and australia have a gd or a nongd gating mutation vertex is currently seeking marketing approval for additional mutations which would increase kalydeco’s target population to up to  of the total cf patient population other drugs that have been approved for cf patients are palliative treatments that manage the symptoms of the disease such as novartis’ tobi and gilead’s cayston which are used to suppress chronic lung infections and roche’s pulmozyme which is an inhaled therapy used to thin mucus among the product candidates that are currently in development for cf patients we believe vertex’s vx is the most advanced vx is a small molecule “corrector” that aims to transport nonfunctional cftr protein to the cell membrane to achieve some level of activity in the damaged protein vx is intended for a much broader cf patient population than kalydeco and includes patients who are homozygous for the f mutation in june  vertex announced that its two phase  clinical trials of lumacaftor when used in combination with kalydeco in cf patients homozygous for the f mutation showed statistically significant improvement in the study’s primary endpoint of improved lung function compared to placebo our other competitors have research and development programs directed at identifying and developing cftr potentiators cftr correctors and drug candidates with other mechanisms of action that seek to address the underlying cause of cf vertex’s success in developing and commercializing kalydeco and vx if approved could increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of these potential treatments for cf other than vx none of the other companies have listed a f specific compound clinical trial on wwwclinicaltrialsgov our competitors may also obtain fda ema or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available company description we are an innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of rnabased therapeutics for the treatment of severe genetic disorders with an initial focus on cystic fibrosis or cf utilizing our unique proprietary rna repair technologies we believe we will be able to treat genetic disorders in which a single protein is defective due to certain types of genetic mutation we design our therapeutic candidates to specifically target and repair the defective messenger rna or mrna that is a product of a mutated gene in order to restore the expression and function of normal or wildtype protein our technologies employ singlestranded rnabased oligonucleotides which act as guide sequences to repair the targeted abnormal mrna the repaired mrna then acts as a template to generate wildtype protein to address the underlying cause of the genetic disorder we believe that this is a unique approach that offers advantages compared with small molecule gene therapy and other therapeutic strategies our current efforts are dedicated to the development of a diseasemodifying therapy for the treatment of cf the most common fatal inherited disease in the western world which affects an estimated  to  patients worldwide we are also developing a treatment for leber’s congenital amaurosis or lca the leading genetic cause of blindness in childhood further based on our own research and initial selection criteria we believe that our rna repair technologies can potentially be used to treat a broad range of other severe genetic diseases that are currently untreatable or have limited effective treatment options and to date we have identified more than  potential target indications since we began operations in may  we have raised approximately € million from private placements of equity securities in addition we have received grants loans and other funding from cffocused patient organizations
