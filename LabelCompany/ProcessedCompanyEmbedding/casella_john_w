enable us to apply our knowledge and experience in recycling collection organics energy and landfills to create economic and environmental value for our customers and our communities our resource renewal vision we have believed in a vision for resource renewal long before it was first defined in our  sustainability report resource renewal is about turning waste into resources it is what we do when we partner with our customers to find practical ways to harvest value from discarded materials with resource renewal we help to convert societys current linear system of resource extractionanddisposal into a cyclical system in which eventually there are no wastes there are only resources we humbly acknowledge that we cannot create this transformation overnight nor can we create it alone such a shift requires a thoughtful policy framework and the active collaboration of players throughout the global supply chain including manufacturers who insist on responsibly harvested raw materials designers who craft products for durability and recyclability and consumers who respectfully handle and care for the products they buy although this cyclical resource economy is still in its infancy today with this report we are proud to provide a few case studies that show that resource renewal is possible see page 8 for more the zero waste cycle there are no benign technologies that take away all of the results of our activities as human beings one doesnt have the godgiven right to consume the worlds resources with no consequences for what were doing you dont exist to do anything from a socially responsible standpoint unless youre a profitable company so we have to be capitalists to survive but that doesnt mean thats all we have to be  john w casella creating excellence magazine september 0 letter from the ceo nearly four decades ago my brother doug and i built vermonts first recycling facility in our hometown of rutland it was a simple plant for baling cardboard and other material and we had simple motives  to serve and create value for our customers  to grow and diversify our business and  to play a part in protecting the natural heritage and landscape of vermont it was not a term anyone used widely back then but our small recycling plant was built upon the foundation of sustainability  both environmental and economic this is the only true sustainability one does not exist without the other from that first facility  and on that foundation  we have built a company with a vision of solid waste management powered by a broad and enduring commitment to providing recycling collection organics energy and landfill services and other resource solutions now forty years later you are viewing our companys third sustainability report weve shared it with you at a time in history when sustainability is no longer simply an experiment but an imperative it is no longer a buzzword but a powerful framework for addressing the challenge of our planets limited resources while driving economic opportunity and strength innovation creativity and quality of life we have three goals for this report first celebrate the progress our company has made in contributing to the sustainability of our planet our communities and our customers lives and businesses also we rely on this report and the public life it lives to hold us accountable to our beliefs and our behaviors second share with you our local homegrown perspective on sustainability from our unique perch here in the northeastern united states we are a local company blessed to live and work alongside our customer and communities we see  and share  their challenges their needs their goals and their vision for their own lives and livelihoods everyday in a way only a new england company with vermont roots can third begin a vital conversation about how we all view the social economic and environmental value resource renewal and resource solutions create across our marketplace our nation and our planet we are at an important moment in history a turning point that has given us an opportunity to shift the way we look at our resources and the investments we may be required to make to sustain a high quality of life many of our paradigms and approaches are antiquated and will not serve us well in the future what has worked for the previous four decades we believe wont work for the challenges of the next ten twenty or forty years we dont necessarily have the answers but everyone needs to be a part of the conversation  a conversation wed like to lead while we talk a lot in this report about our facilities hard assets and investments and our services i firmly believe that the coming years will reveal our people and our partnerships to be our most compelling assets faced with the tremendous task of developing a whole new infrastructure for resource sustainability and inspiring deep shifts in public thinking and behavior we must not underestimate the power of our talented passionate people working in partnership with motivated customers engaged communities and visionary organizations so it is our people who make this report more than a document who live our beliefs everyday and to whom we owe our thanks regards john w casella chairman  ceo casella waste systems inc read the letter from the ceo our journey  approach like so many others we operate in a dynamic industry that is in transition some of the major issues currently affecting the way we run our business include global trends in population and economic development are placing mounting pressure on natural resource supply chains for both environmental and economic reasons the world needs high quality recycled commodities to minimize our reliance on virgin resources the mix of material in the disposal stream has shifted we are seeing less paper and a wider variety of plastic packaging in the recycling stream in general we are seeing a larger ratio of industrial material entering the disposal stream and less municipal material due to local recovery efforts the economic and environmental viability of the wastetoenergy wte incineration model is coming into question leaving communities to decide whether to enter longterm agreements with wte suppliers or pursue alternatives statelevel decisionmakers are passing new rules in hopes of creating environmental benefits economic efficiencies and green jobs vermonts act 8 universal recycling law and massachusetts new commercial organics ban are examples customers want more than just reliable safe and compliant solid waste service they are looking for partners to help them meet recycling goals and a new professional services model that includes access to data recycling options for more of their waste streams and low carbon disposal options the most progressive customers are taking a sophisticated approach that looks beyond the solid waste budget lineitem to recognize and invest in the full value creation possibilities of holistic resource management against this evolving backdrop we have gravitated toward a strategic approach that emphasizes listening to customers to deeply understand their service needs drawing upon our operational expertise and knowledge to solve pressing problems applying our expertise in commodity markets to help customers capture value from their waste deploying solutions that are flexible and responsive to customer needs the approach is customer rather than technologycentric instead of a onesizefitsall builditandtheywillcome approach it is adaptive to evolving local needs the resulting solutions and expertise leave us uniquely positioned to deliver shared environmental and economic value to our customers and communities which in turn positions our company to thrive in the postdisposal resource renewal economy our goals recycle  million tons per year of recyclables and organics over the next two years we will focus on reducing our companywide greenhouse gas emissions per ton of waste received with this report we are renewing our commitment to this reduce our diesel consumption by 0 as with our diesel goal we are renewing our commitment to reduce our electricity consumption by  demonstrate improvement in our annual corporate culture survey by  train 00 of our managers to apply selecting the one principles in their hiring decisions by   of managers and supervisors will have completed leadership training shared responsibility for social good we believe that the services we provide and the investments we make in managing and renewing resources must be economically sustainable as well as environmentally sustainable one cannot exist without the other we also believe that recycling is part of a larger and more crucial set of challenges facing society and the planet we are  we believe  entering an era of constraints and limits in nearly all areas of human activity including energy climate and natural resources in this belief we are optimists these challenges represent significant opportunities for innovation creativity economic growth and security environmental stewardship and quality of life for future generations these challenges also demand major shifts in thinking particularly around how and why we shape public policy how and why we pay for resource renewal and how and why we place a value on it  for ourselves our children and our society the economics around many of our most pressing resource challenges  energy climate etc  remain underdeveloped and in need of transformation recycling for example  and its widening contribution to resource sustainability  is one of those challenges if our goal as a society and as a planet is to address the challenges of resource limits and to build a sustainable way of life are resource renewal services like recycling worth paying for is recycling worth investing in for the short and longterm social economic and environmental value it creates what responsibility does each of us have to contribute to its economic sustainability so we continue to enjoy its environmental sustainability our goal  in fact our responsibility  is to lead that conversation with our stakeholders public policymakers and our customers learn more about our sustainability initiatives capturing value from waste through innovative resource solutions our comprehensive resource solutions
