blanding warwick ri mark levine melissa r emert jules brody new york city for plaintiff william grimm hinckely allen snyder  comen providence ri for defendants memorandum and order pettine senior district judge this case is before me essentially to determine whether the defendants are the perpetrators of a scheme to defraud the public in violation of the securities exchange act of  § b or whether the defendants are along with the plaintiff merely victims — casualties of this regions recent economic downturn see eg dileo v ernst  young  fd   th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   it is not the first time that this court has been called upon to decide whether the plaintiffs complaint can survive a motion to dismiss i will therefore assume familiarity with the facts and opinions and only briefly note that on january   i found that none of plaintiffs federal security law claims could survive defendants motion to dismiss haft v eastland financial corp haft i  fsupp   dri i dismissed the complaint without prejudice and allowed time for the plaintiff to file an amended complaint id at  plaintiff eventually filed an amended complaint and the defendants parried with another motion to dismiss that motion was denied on july   haft v eastland financial corp ca no p dri haft ii this case is now before me on defendants motion for reconsideration of my july   memorandum and order briefly plaintiffs amended complaint is a class action in two counts the class period is defined as beginning on january   and ending on january   count i is against both defendants eastland financial corporation and herbert miller chairman and chief executive officer of the corporation for violations of section b rule b and section  of the securities exchange act of   act count ii is against both defendants for negligent misrepresentation in light of haft iis reasoning defendants have now raised a threshold jurisdictional question because i am persuaded by defendants argument with regard to standing i upon reconsideration grant defendants motion to dismiss i regret not having spotted the jurisdictional question earlier now that it has been brought to my attention however i welcome the opportunity to correct what i believe to have been an error discussion standing is a preliminary matter to be evaluated upon the allegations of the complaint gabrielsen v banctexas group inc  fsupp   ndtex the question whether a party has standing to prosecute a claim concerns the power of federal courts to hear and decide cases standing focuses on the party seeking to get his complaint before the federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated when the issue of plaintiffs standing is raised the relevant inquiry is whether  the plaintiff has shown an injury to himself that is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision to satisfy the constitutional requirement the plaintiff who seeks to invoke judicial power must stand to profit in some personal interest absent a showing of personal injury exercise of power by a federal court would be gratuitous and thus inconsistent with constitutional limitations id at  citations omitted the fact that a case is brought as a class action does not change the calculus named plaintiffs cannot represent a class of whom they are not a part harris v mcrae  us   n   sct   n   ledd   citing bailey v patterson  us    sct    ledd   see adair v sorenson  frd   dmass a court must assess standing to sue based upon the standing of the named plaintiff and not upon the standing of unidentified class members gabrielsen  fsupp at  n  inclusion of class action allegations in a complaint does not relieve a plaintiff of himself meeting the requirements for constitutional standing  standing cannot be acquired through the back door of a class action schwartz v novo industri as  fsupp   n  sdny as our court of appeals held in denny v barber  fd   d cir a plaintiff who cannot share in a recovery  is not a proper representative of persons who purchased securities after other allegedly fraudulent statements were issued to determine whether the named plaintiff in this case has standing sufficient to meet the constitutional case or controversy requirement i must assess the amended complaint in light of section b of the  act that section forbids persons in connection with the purchase or sale of securities from engaging in manipulation or fraud in violation of the rules promulgated by the sec in re general motors class e stock buyout securities litigation  fsupp   ddel  emphasis added rule b states that it shall be unlawful for any person  a to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading or c to engage in any act practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person in connection with the purchase or sale of any security  cfr § b emphasis added to state a claim under section b therefore a plaintiff must allege a loss resulting from reasonable reliance upon a materially false representation general motors  fsupp at  this is known as the in connection with requirement of section b in other words section b has been interpreted by the supreme court as requiring an actual purchase or sale of a security that is connected with a challenged statement konstantinakos v fdic  fsupp   dmass where a misrepresentation or omission causes a person to retain shares previously purchased rather than purchase new shares or sell already owned ones the shareholder does not have standing to bring a b claim id citing blue chip stamps v manor drug store  us    sct    ledd   see adair  frd at  plaintiff cannot establish that he relied on events which occurred after he purchased his stock schwartz  fsupp at  statements made subsequent to plaintiffs purchase are not in themselves actionable under b moreover when the complaint sounds in fraud  fedrcivp b applies rule b states that in averments of fraud or mistake the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity malice intent knowledge and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally this rule known as the particularity requirement applies to section b and rule b claims because fraud lies at the core of the action haft i  fsupp at  citations omitted finally plaintiffs complaint must allege more than mere corporate mismanagement in santa fe industries inc v green  us    sct    ledd   the united states supreme court  held that the federal securities laws do not regulate transactions which constitute no more than internal corporate mismanagement haft i  fsupp at  citations omitted absent details of specific misrepresentations or omissions of material facts which were required to be disclosed  a complaint may do no more than state a claim for corporate mismanagement id citations omitted this brings me to the primary issue regarding plaintiffs amended complaint — the intersection of the standing requirements and the sufficiency of the plaintiffs allegations in light the analysis supra the plaintiff in order to meet the constitutional standing requirement must allege misrepresentations sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss pursuant to the particularity requirement of fedrcivp b and sufficient to withstand analysis under the santa fe doctrine and the misrepresentations must have occurred prior to his purchase or sale of securities in haft ii i found that the plaintiff stated a claim sufficient to survive rule b and santa fe with paragraph  of his amended complaint in that paragraph the plaintiff noted that on june   miller met with some institutional investors rejected merrill lynchs assessment of eastland stock as a shortterm risk but a longterm buy and dismissed concerns about eastlands heavy emphasis on commercial real estate then three months later eastland announced a record third quarter loss due to an increase in nonperforming loans to support the inference of fraud necessary to survive a motion to dismiss plaintiff noted that on or about april   eastland filed with the sec the following statement over  millers signature by mid overbuilding in the real estate area and a slowdown in the new england economy led us to realize that the same activities that previously worked so well for us were now working against us we knew it would not be business as usual haft ii supra slip op at  i found that this statement raised a reasonable inference that adverse circumstances existed at the time the statement was made and were known and deliberately or recklessly disregarded by the defendants id quoting romani v shearson lehman hutton  fd   st cir the problem as pointed out by the defendants in their memorandum in support of their motion for reconsideration with reliance on the above is that the alleged misrepresentation was made after the named plaintiff purchased his stock according to paragraph  of the amended complaint haft purchased stock in eastland on march   — more than two months before the alleged misrepresentation to determine therefore whether there are any allegations sufficient to support jurisdiction in this case i reconsidered the alleged misrepresentations that occurred prior to march   in doing so i determined once again that none of the earlier statements were sufficient see supra note  the plaintiffs substantive allegations begin with paragraph  of the amended complaint that paragraph focuses on two statements made by defendant miller reported in the providence journal journal on january   according to the complaint miller in an attempt to allay the concerns of investors with regard to nervousness about the real estate market in rhode island stated that what people dont realize is that we have had more experience in commercial lending than a lot of other players moreover miller publicly stated sometime in january  that eastlands stock should trade in the  to  range paragraph  of the amended complaint states that on or about march   eastland disseminated its  annual report to shareholders for the year ended december   in that report there was a letter over defendant millers signature which stated that we believe that by expanding and seeking out quality commercial real estate loans we can sustain our growth objectives and continue to add value to our stockholders investment amended complaint paragraph  miller also stated that it is  expected that nonperforming loans will be reduced in  amended complaint paragraph  in addition according to paragraph  of the amended complaint the review of operations section of the report contained the following statement while maintaining strict credit policy standards commercial banking efforts are focused on the small and midsized market where the combination of financial risk and potential financial gain offer an acceptable rate of return to establish that these statements were part of a continuing pattern of materially false and misleading statements made without reasonable basis plaintiff focuses on several underlying facts these facts are set forth in paragraphs     and  of the amended complaint plaintiff alleges that the optimistic statements quoted above were misrepresentations because in an article entitled theres more to stock tables than fine print published in the journal on december   and cited in paragraph  of the complaint the reporter stated that it turns out that eastland financed a number of marginal projects appendix to defendants brief in support of motion to dismiss the amended complaint defendants appendix exhibit m this statement fails to provide the underlying factual support required by rule b it is not a direct quote from the defendants it is merely an analysts opinion the complaint must rise or fall on allegations about defendants conduct and not on wideeyed citation to the gratuitous commentary of outsiders such commentary is irrelevant to plaintiffs claims hershfang v citicorp  fsupp   sdny moreover the statement even if it were attributed to the defendants would not be adequate under the santa fe doctrine because there is no fraud by hindsight dileo  fd at  quoting denny  fd at  the words it turns out indicate that the reporters comment is nothing more than an expression of hindsight wisdom paragraph  is not sufficient either that paragraph notes that according to another journal article april   miller stated that i never should have said that the stock should trade at  i didnt know what i was talking about plaintiff alleges that this direct quote supports the inference that when miller earlier stated that the stock should trade in the  range he knowingly or recklessly misrepresented the situation i cannot agree millers earlier statement about the price of the stock was merely a prediction statements about future events that are plainly expressions of opinion and not guarantees are not actionable under the federal securities laws hershfang supra  fsupp at  citing friedman v mohasco corp  fd   d cir to support his allegation that the defendants were not seeking out quality loans although they said they were plaintiff points to paragraphs  and  of his amended complaint in paragraph  plaintiff notes that in an article in the woonsocket call on january   it was reported that eastland as the sole bidder bought at auction the former social department store building which had been vacant for two years and on which eastland had a third mortgage defendants appendix supra exhibit o although this may suggest that eastland erred in extending the loan one arguably less than prudent loan does not make defendants earlier statements fraudulent misrepresentations the march  statement in the annual report that eastland was seeking out quality commercial real estate loans was a broad statement not made materially false by the existence of one bad loan see general motors  fsupp at  quoting basic inc v levinson  us   sct    ledd   for a fact to be material there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available moreover there is no indication of when eastland made the loan on the social department store building — perhaps it was well before march of  this allegation cannot survive santa fe if anything it merely alleges negligence failing to disclose possible mismanagement or incompetence does not state a federal securities law claim haft i  fsupp at  citing santa fe  us at   sct at  there is no misrepresentation sufficient to support a section b claim paragraph  states that the journal on april   reported that eastland financial corporation earned a reputation as an aggressive real estate lender that booked loans others turned away after it converted to a public company in  as i discussed supra a reporters opinion of eastlands reputation cannot provide a factual basis for alleging that the defendants optimistic statements were fraudulent or reckless analysts opinions are neither relevant  nor admissible and even if the analysts assumptions are true that can not reasonably lead to an inference that defendants made intentional or reckless misrepresentations to the public at an earlier time hershfang supra  fsupp at  plaintiffs final basis for his allegations is found in paragraph  there plaintiff notes that on april   the journal reported that defendant miller admitted that the bank didnt monitor its projects plaintiff finds this to be in sharp contrast to the banks premarch   statements i am not persuaded that this statement raises an inference of fraud the securities laws do not put executives of public corporations to the choice of either hiding their mistakes or facing a classaction shareholder suit in fact the fundamental purpose of the securities laws is just the opposite — to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the policy of caveat emptor and thus to achieve a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry hershfang supra  fsupp at  quoting sec v capital gains research bureau inc  us    sct    ledd   and citing basic  sct at  moreover the fact that the defendant admitted that the bank did not monitor projects sufficiently tends to refute any allegation that the earlier statement was part of a scheme to defraud if that were true why would the defendant essentially admit the earlier fraud no reasonable inference is raised see romani  fd at  the allegation cannot survive rule b scrutiny i find therefore that none of the premarch   statements are sufficient to state a claim upon which relief could be granted plaintiffs allegations are backed up either by statements that do not meet the particularity requirement ie statements not attributed to the defendants that merely express reporters opinions and statements that raise no reasonable inference of fraud or allegations that fail to survive santa fe scrutiny it is axiomatic that the federal securities laws do not provide a cause of action for corporate mismanagement konstantinakos  fsupp at  n  nor do they provide a cause of action for merely failing to disclose innocent negligence see haft i  fsupp at  citations omitted moreover because i believe that i erred when i previously found that the june   statement was actionable see supra notes  and  i need only briefly address the question of whether other statements or conduct by the defendants after the plaintiff purchased his stock paragraphs  of the amended complaint are circumstantial evidence of the fraud he alleges occurred prior to his stock purchase schwartz  fsupp at  the statements made subsequent to plaintiffs purchase are not considered as primary evidence of fraud id at  n  moreover the allegations regarding statements made after march  are basically supported by the same facts paragraphs      of the amended complaint that i have already rejected as support for the earlier misrepresentations beyond the alleged misrepresentations the rest of the complaint does little more than chronicle the downturn in eastlands fortunes and cite to the defendants hopeful predictions looking at the complaint as a totality i still do not find even circumstantial support for a section b claim as i have said before this is yet another case where at one time the firm bathes itself in a favorable light later the firm discloses that things are less rosy the plaintiff contends that the difference must be attributable to fraud haft i  fsupp at  quoting dileo  fd at  in this case i cannot agree with the plaintiffs assessment of the situation securities laws do not guarantee sound business practices and do not protect investors against reverses dileo  fd at  citations omitted i therefore upon reconsideration grant defendants motion to dismiss moreover i decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state law claim see united mine workers v gibbs  us    sct    ledd   figueroa ruiz v alegria  fd   st cir so ordered footnotes  for a description of the facts of this case see haft  fsupp at  in haft this court dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with the particularity requirement of fedrcivp b and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to fedrcivp b in light of santa fe industries inc v green  us    sct    ledd    for a description of the procedural history of the filing of the amended complaint see haft ii supra slip op at   as will become obvious infra the class has not been certified  in plaintiffs amended complaint nicholas vrabel treasurer of the corporation is no longer named moreover plaintiff dropped his claim under section  and section  of the securities act of  as well as his common law fraud claim see haft i  fsupp at  for a description of the original complaint  there are three purposes behind rule bs particularity requirement  to place the defendants on notice and enable them to prepare meaningful responses  to preclude the use of a groundless fraud claim as a pretext to discovering a wrong or as a strike suit and  to safeguard defendants from frivolous charges which might damage their reputations haft i  fsupp at  quoting new england data services inc v becher  fd   st cir in other words to avoid dismissal on particularity grounds the plaintiff must be able to convey with their complaint some sense of how they came to believe that fraud was the heart of their losses haft i  fsupp at  for a full description of this courts analysis of fedrcivp b as applied to securities cases see id at   although i also stated that the inference of fraud was supported by other allegations in the complaint paragraph  contained the only primary allegation of fraud that i at that time found to be sufficient on its own to overcome rule b and santa fe now as i will discuss infra i believe that i was wrong and therefore find that even if there were not a lack of standing paragraph  would fail to state a claim that could survive dismissal  defendants have argued that a serious question of law is raised in this case by plaintiffs attempt to rely on  what are inevitably incomplete and inaccurate newspaper reports of defendants purported statements to meet the threshold pleading requirement of rule b in fact in defendants motion for reconsideration they asked this court alternatively for interlocutory appeal certification pursuant to  usc § b as i have found upon reconsideration in favor of the defendants i need not address their request for interlocutory appeal i would note however that although i believe that newspaper statements must necessarily be viewed with caution because defendants have less than complete control over such reports schwartz  fsupp at  a motion to dismiss calls for a court to accept the allegations as true whether the report is an accurate reflection of what was actually stated is more properly addressed on a motion for summary judgment because i do not find it necessary nor appropriate to formally convert the defendants motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment i did not consider any documents or affidavits submitted by the defendants other than the complete newspaper articles excerpts of which appear in the plaintiffs complaint see romani  fd at  n  ballan v wilfred american educational corp  fsupp   edny  a complaint of fraud must provide factual allegations that would support a reasonable inference that adverse circumstances existed at the time the statement was made and were known and deliberately or recklessly disregarded by defendants haft ii supra slip op at  quoting romani  fd at   in romani  fd at  n  the first circuit court of appeals noted that a court may consider documents cited in the pleadings in their entirety on a motion to dismiss  finally the woonsocket call goes on to note that the auctioneer said it was not unusual for there to be only one bidder on a commercial property particularly one which has several liens against it defendants appendix supra exhibit o to the extent that the plaintiff suggests that being the sole bidder at such an auction suggests problems that should have been disclosed the full text of the article at least suggests the opposite  moreover in that article entitled the freeze is on credit crunch wounds business compounds regions economic woes the reporter also discusses how bankers throughout the region are cutting back loans sharply to business borrowers signaling the end of the lending binge of the s and threatening to push the new england economy deeper into what many now call a recession defendants appendix supra exhibit r the article quotes the owner of fh french company as stating that whether it is fleet or shawmut or bank of new england or eastland they are all flipflopping and whereas before they were overly lax now they are extraordinarily stringent id one could draw the conclusion that the other banks were also a bit overzealous in their lending practices thus putting eastlands reputation somewhat in doubt  as i stated supra march   was the last date that the plaintiff purchased or sold eastland securities  it is this reasoning that has lead me to believe that despite the now obvious standing problem my earlier ruling focusing on the june   statement was incorrect if the defendants were intentionally misrepresenting the banks financial state in mid why would they then admit the deceit in a statement
