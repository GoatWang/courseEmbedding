that year the eventual sanwatokai merger formed ufj bank resona mergeredit daiwa formed a bank holding company daiwa bank holdings in december  to serve as the parent entity of daiwa kinki osaka bank and nara bank later that month daiwa announced that asahi bank would be acquired by daiwa bank holdings in a share swap transaction forming the fifthlargest banking group in japan the company was renamed resona holdings inc on october   daiwa and asahi consolidated operations on march   with most of their assets combined to form resona bank  asahi bank branches in saitama and three branches in tokyo were moved to a separate entity saitama resona bank postmerger developmentsedit in early  the resona groups capital adequacy ratio fell dangerously low the bank had proposed to maintain its capital adequacy ratio above the legal limit by factoring in deferred tax assets however the value of these deferred assets could only be claimed if the company turned a profit in the future because of banks profit outlook was so dim resonas auditor refused to certify the companys financial statement if the deferred tax assets were included without being able to count the deferred tax assets the bank was effectively insolvent the resona case threatened to cripple the entire countrys financial system since the other major banks were also counting on deferred tax assets to maintain their capital adequacy ratios on may   the japan government decided to inject  trillion yen in public funds into the resona group through resona bank this move through the share exchange agreement between the bank and the holding company effectively nationalized the bank since the government emerged as the companys majority shareholder holding  of voting rights of the holding company while the holdings of existing shareholders was greatly diluted the existing management was sacked and a new management was installed former resona chairman eiji hosoya is credited with leading the banks revival following the  bailout hosoya initially resisted taking the appointment to head resona saying in a news conference held on may   i decided to accept the offer as i realized that stabilizing the financial system is the highest priority for the japanese economy under hosoya the banks new management immediately set about to reduce resonas nonperforming loans npls in  the company managed to turn a profit of ￥ billion as a result resonas management announced a plan to over the next  years return to the government ￥ billion of the ￥ trillion in public funds it has received hosoya died in november  resona introduced two new fulltime employee career tracks in  one no overtime track for employees seeking better worklife balance and another track for employees who wish to remain in a single position for their entire career these policies were unique among japanese banks at the time of their introduction group companiesedit resona bank limited saitama resona bank limited the kinki
