been put on hold indefinitely due to falling market prices combined with an inability to secure additional financing to proceed what particularly sets bear lodge apart from other rare earths deposits is that it holds significant quantities of what are termed by the us department of energy as the critical rare earth oxides creos including neodymium dysprosium praseodymium europium and terbium the bull hill deposit may be the second richest europium deposit on earth the deposit also contains significant quantities of yttrium it is these six creos that china is expected to begin importing in  based on that country’s announcement in its july  white paper creos are the most highly valued of the rare earths and are essential components for numerous hightech and defense applications
