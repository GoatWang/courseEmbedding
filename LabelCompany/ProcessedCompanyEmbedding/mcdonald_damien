promising start to  id like to walk you through some of the events that recently happened at livanova and then discuss our sales results by business franchise after my comments vivid will give you some more color on the financials and then ill wrap up with closing comments before moving to qa over the past couple of months we announced several key decisions in support of our efforts to advance strategic objectives first caisson we announced last month that we acquired caisson interventional one of the equity investments weve been a strategic investor in caisson since  they have a dedicated and innovative team of professionals and are working on one of the most revolutionary technology in the transcatheter mitral valve replacement or tmvr field our device is unique as it is the only product designed solely for the transseptal approach and delivered through a single venous access the device is also designed to be fully retrievable once the function of implant is fully assessed but prior to final release while that system is still in early feasibility stage we believe that this deal makes clear strategic sense our cardiac surgery business currently sold at portfolio for surgical valve replacement and repair and this acquisition will position us as a leader in the field we are now positioned to accelerate clinical and regulatory efforts in tmvr and ultimately deliver important innovative therapies to our patients caisson initiated human implants in june  through a  patient fda early feasibility study in the us indiscernible at the third annual zurich mitral valve meeting in early february results were presented for six patients enrolled in the study with five of them successfully implanted in the six patient the valve was successfully retrieved which is an important clinical feature patient enrollment in the ce mark trial which will be called interlude will begin this year interlude has already been approved in canada and we will begin patient enrollment midyear that will be followed by patient enrollment in europe and the us later in  we are currently targeting ce mark in late  or  with us fda approval coming several years later today there an estimated  million people in the us suffering from severe mitral regurgitation but only about  patients are receiving mitral valve surgery annually thats approximately  of the total patient pool external estimates show the market potential as a multibillion dollar global opportunity we believe this market will develop comparably to the transcatheter aortic valve replacement or tavr market with a vast majority of procedures taking place through a transseptal route which is our approach this acquisition places livanova in a strong position to set the benchmark for tmvr systems and to be a leading player in the market regarding some of the specifics of the transaction the purchase price for the remaining  of the company is  million net of  million of debt forgiveness the first payment of approximately  million was made at closing the remainder we paid out over the next several years on a schedule largely driven by regulatory approval and sales earnouts we expect this acquisition to be dilutive to earnings for several years as we go through clinical trials continue rd spend and invest in our production facilities and commercial activities however for all the reasons we have discussed we believe that in the long term this opportunity will create value for our shareholders and be positively accretive to our earnings second management changes we announced several weeks ago that our current cfo vivid sehgal is leaving the company at the end of may to pursue other opportunities vivid has been an integral part of our executive leadership team and i want to thank him for his significant contributions in helping position the company for sustainable growth we expect to announce the successor in the near future and vivid has agreed to support an orderly transition in addition jacques gutedel president of europe has been succeeded by indiscernible most recently indiscernible was an executive of danaher and prior to that was ceo of hitachi medical systems in europe he has an extensive track record in healthcare throughout europe asia latin america and the middle east id like to thank jacq for his leadership and his contributions to the company over the last eight years third simplification weve said numerous times that we are working on simplifying our business model one of the areas we are focused on simplifying is our manufacturing footprint and we have taken several steps toward advancing this goal during the first quarter we completed the closure of our costa rica manufacturing operation where we had duplicative manufacturing of our vns devices we also made a decision to cease production of the oxygenator facility we were building in suzhou china market dynamics and expectations in the region have evolved and as a result we no longer believe that this facility is the best strategic auction or use of cash for livanova this decision does not in any way dilute our commitment to delivering strong emerging markets growth and finally t heatercooler devices on our fourth quarter and yearend  earnings call we disclosed that we developed a t device remediation plan which included a loaner program a deep disinfection service and a design modification to address the issue of potential aerosolization we said that in the design modification was subject to final verification and validation and we would begin implementing the modification in the second quarter we are pleased to announce that we have completed final verification and validation for these design modifications which allowed us to obtain ce mark in april we will begin implementing the ceiling and vacuum solution in the next few weeks these changes will be performed at no cost to our customers implementation will start in western europe followed by multiple other countries as we receive regulatory approvals in the us we continue to make progress towards approval as we work collaboratively with the fda as a leader in the industry we are pleased to offer many of our customers and patients a solution that enables lifesaving cardiac surgery turning now to our net sales results for the quarter in our press release we provided table that shows both reported net sales and constant currency growth so you can see the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for discussion purposes we are going to focus our comments on net sales results with constant currency growth net sales was slightly up compared to the first quarter of  strong price and volume gains in neuromodulation were offset by lower sales in cardiac surgery and crm if we look at each business franchise cardiac surgery sales were  million a decrease of  from the first quarter of  sales for cardiopulmonary were  million in the quarter a decrease of  as we discussed in the past cardiopulmonary includes disposable sales which make up approximately  of the total and capital which makes up the remaining  the higher sales product in disposable is oxygenators and due to the solid demand for inspire we continue to see very consistent growth in the  to  range in capital the higher sales product is heart lung machines or hlm to the end of  we saw relatively steady sales for hlm in the us but its started to see softness in europe in the second half of the year if you recall we discussed that this was due to customers delaying new purchases and holding onto their machines longer in anticipation of the next round of innovation this quarter we have started to see a comparable dynamic in the us and hearing similar comments from our us customers i want to reiterate we do not believe we are losing share to competitors in either region we have  global market share with hlm and while our competitors have been more vocal in their discussions with customers we are working on innovation which we will be discussing further at our investor day in the third quarter sales for heart valves were  million in the quarter a decrease of less than  our tissue valve business increased  as a result of solid performance in perceval as suture less valve particularly in the us and this was offset by declines in mechanical heart valves which is starting to move more in line with market declines the crm sales were  million during the quarter a decrease of  compared to the first quarter of  in low voltage pacemakers were up for the quarter driven by strong demand for kora  in japan in high voltage we saw softness in icds compared to a strong quarter last year with the launch rollout of platinium devices this was offset by strong growth in our platinium crtd products due to the recent incorporation of the is standards now let’s turn to neuromodulation sales were  million up  versus the first quarter of  with growth in all regions aspiresr continue to perform well from both a volume and price perspective the patient growth was strong once again with growth continuing in the mid to high single digits this is reflective of demand for the product driven by a focused investments regarding innovation we recently submitted our application to the fda for sentiva sentiva will be our newest vns therapy device and will incorporate the same technology as aspiresr but will be smaller in size and we anticipate approval of the device in the latter part of the year i’ll now turn the call over to vivid for an overview of our financial results vivid vivid sehgal thank you damien adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales in the quarter was  up  basis points from the first quarter of  resulting from favorable mix and continued focus on cost efficiencies for fullyear we still expect gross margin to be in the mid range adjusted rd expense in the first quarter was  million rd as a percentage of net sales was  an improvement of  basis points from the first quarter of  for the fullyear we now estimate rd as a percentage of sales to be in the range of  to  as a result our of incremental spend related to investments in tmvr adjusted sga expense for the first quarter was  million sga as a percentage of net sales was  an improvement of  basis points from the first quarter of  for the fullyear we now estimate adjusted sga as a percentage of sales to be in the range of  to  as a result of incremental operating expenses related to the caisson acquisition adjusted operating income was  million in the first quarter operating margin was  an improvement compared to  in the first quarter of last year our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was  an improvement from the  in the first quarter of  as a result of our ongoing tax efforts finally adjusted diluted eps for the first quarter of  was   higher than the first quarter of  turning now to cash flow our cash flow from operations for the three months ended march  was  million cash flow from operations excluding payments for onetime integration restructuring was  million capital spending for the first three months was  million in line with the same period of  our cash balance at march  was  million up from  million as at december   our net debt at march  was  million down from  million as of the end of  in part due to our continued focus on working capital with the acquisition of caisson we have updated our fullyear guidance starting with the income statement with the exception of adjusted rd sga and earnings per share for other fullyear guidance ranges we provided at march  remain the same key guidance ranges are included in our first quarter performance presentation available in the investor relations section of our website while changes to adjusted rd and sga have been discussed we are now estimating adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of  to  with our share account to be approximately  million in terms of eps calendarization we now anticipate earnings in the second half of the year to be approximately  greater than in the first half of the year primarily due to momentum in emerging markets and continued growth in neuromodulation over the course of the year moving to cash flow our adjusted cash flow from operations for  excluding integration restructuring and t remediation payments is now expected to be in the range of  million to  million the integration restructuring and t remediation payments are expected to remain in the range of  million to  million with that ill turn the call back to damien for some final comments damien mcdonald thanks vivid karen said something at the start and just let me reiterate that i want to thank you for everything youve done for the company and especially how much ive enjoyed working with you this last few months and all i can say is wish you and your family all very best vivid sehgal appreciate it thank you damien mcdonald so in summary we started out  delivering solid sales leveraging our income statement and driving strong cash generation many or our growth drivers aspiresr perceval inspire and kora  continued to perform well we are on track with our submission for sentiva to the fda and are looking forward to approvals towards the end of the year we also made significant progress with the acquisition of caisson and we want to extend a warm welcome to the caisson team we are excited to bring their talent innovation and passion to livanova this team is our planned entry into tmvr space which has the potential to be an important growth platform for us in the future this is a large market with an unmet need we believe that we have a unique technology that can offer patients the most advanced minimally invasive mitral valve replacement option weve also made great strides for the t device remediation plan and are pleased to be able to offer our many customers a solution in the near future we are on track and working diligently to achieve our annual commitments the organization is focused on strengthening our position as an innovative medical device company and in delivering longterm shareholder value we look forward to updating you on our continued progress next quarter and with that charlotte we are ready for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott bardo from berenberg your line is now open scott bardo thank you very much so a few questions please the first set of questions on business fundamentals for caisson so i was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more disclosure on your current valve performance youre highlighting strong dynamics with perceval but i think thats been a whole series of quarters where that failed to showing through can you talk a little bit about the base business and for nonpersonal structural valves and what youre doing there to stabilize that situation and when would be a realistic point to start to see some of the possible related growth more visible through the pl thats question one please damien mcdonald great question thanks for joining us lets talk about tissue valves i think were continuing to make headway here i’ll focus on the two positives for a second first of all we continue to have strong double digit growth and particularly in the us and the decline in mechanical heart valves which was high double digits for a long time is starting to get down into the mid to high singledigit range so we’re getting back mechanical heart valves towards what we call the market decline rate which is something we talked about in the past the continuing disappointment for us is the traditional tissue valves again were working on that i consider this one of the big challenges for the organization the whole portfolio was underinvested in and under focused on for a long time and i think we’re continuing to see some of the fallout from mitral flow this is a focus area for us as a management team and while we continue to focus on perceval which we believe as a suture less valve is differentiated in the market getting the tissue valve stabilized probably in the second half is an important focus for us scott bardo thank you and just following up i think you now highlighted a couple of manufacturing facility consolidations one in costa rica and one in china can you talk a little bit more about that because my understanding was that manufacturing consolidation does not par initially of the it pretax energy plan so is this sort of incremental to your plan and strategically speaking little bit confused as to why not having domestic regional manufacturing for those growth territories there’s not still a core priority for the company vivid sehgal scott its vivid here so i think the key thing to think about is first of all these plans have been in the pipeline for some time weve been reviewing over time our entire manufacturing footprint and you’re right when we looked at it these were important decisions that we have taken in terms of our commitment i think particularly on the china one i think whats really good i think as a leadership team as damien has come in is that we have accessed everything from the bottom up activity and i think the situation in china that you’ve seen whether that’s through some of the mechanical heart valve economic conditions where we had to destock for a period of time conditions have changed over time dramatically in china we just think right now as a management team for the best use of our cash and the best use of our resources is to actually focus on driving business like perceval investing in caisson so i don’t think this is a major activity for us and we believe we will be very successful in china and i think if you look at some of the competitors out there we believe that china has moved on from the original assumptions that we had and we actually believe imported product has a very important place in the market today so i think this is about market research and about market conditions damien mcdonald we’ll continue to look at the footprint as youve heard me talk about improving gross margin and where we are in the mids i think this is an important driver here for us in terms of being able to fund investments and looking at this footprint is a key part of that and we’ll continue to  i think make good decisions to improve gross margin and consolidation is a big part of that vivid sehgal and i do think if you look at our position we ended  sort of closing the  gross margin range where finishing the quarter now close just under  we made some pretty good trajectory in terms of gross margin and i think just in terms of all were doing we are looking at opportunities right now in terms of focusing the business to drive better gross margin and better operating margins across the entire business and i think this is just part of the journey there scott bardo and we should think of this as providing some additional comfort in the  million synergies or potentially incremental to the initial plan vivid sehgal i think you should look at it as an opportunity to reinvest back in the business scott i think right now our best opportunity is to put more money behind modulation and more money behind perceval so yes i think it’s freeing up our opportunity to reinvest right now scott bardo okay thank you and then perhaps if we can come onto that congratulations on the bold move with cash on i just wanted if you could share thoughts as to why now why would livanova make the step now what was the triggering factor i know youve highlighted some promising early observations have you seen any additional data which really clings to do for you or is that other factors damien mcdonald great question look i’ve been in markets where unique opportunities come along and i really believe this is one of them we spoke last quarter about our capital allocations strategy organic first and equity investments weve been partnering with cj and todd and the team since  and we wanted this to be about getting a great product to market fast and we didnt want this to be about working to find the next funding milestone and we really believed that putting our resources with the team especially clinical and regulatory and market access is a great decision to help accelerate this its a strong team they have a unique technology that’s differentiated we think that it’s derisk to some extent because it’s already in clinical and has a clinical pathway especially around ce mark so based on our assessment we have a pretty high hurdle rate for irr and we’ve looked at a number of deals recently where we’ve walked away because they havent met our handle looking at caisson we believe this is really compelling and we believe it was the best use of capital and management energy scott bardo all right great and perhaps last question before i jump in the queue so youve highlighted some additional investment through the pl which is understandable but youve mentioned the dilutive nature if you like for some years to come can you share some thoughts on that do you see this as being if you like diminishing in earnings dilution over time or is there any bump off if you like in cost that required to secure successful commercialization i just want to understand how to think about this in the longer term or over the next few years and following on from that please obviously you’re taking a bit of earnings dilution you have a very strong balance sheet why were not announcing today a step up in share buyback to mitigate the needs and dilution thank you vivid sehgal i think the way to look at this is obviously we’ve mentioned that this deal will be diluted in terms of eps this year we take in the top and the bottom end of the guidance solely due to caisson down by about  what we are going to talk about is  right now where we actually believe that a minimum level the same type of eps dilution you can expect the same thing again i think beyond that this really is about the investment in the clinical trials and how they go but i would say that we do believe this will be diluted but now i think  is where we’re going to draw a line in terms of where we expect this to be it will be at a minimum to similar levels to what it is today in terms of the share buyback position that still remains a strong option for the company at this stage we obviously as damien has said we’ve been looking around we’ve been seeing other opportunities that we have we have as he said have a pretty active review of our strategic options from a capital allocation strategy and weve been looking not just this case but other things as well so i wouldnt discount anything right now and i think as a company the good news is that we still have a  million of our original share buyback program available to us and we have spent  million of that so its more of a point of actually just timing of what we’re going to do scott bardo thanks i’ll hop back in the queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jason mills from canaccord your line is now open cecilia furlong hi good morning this is actually cecilia furlong on for jason and i could just briefly turn back to caisson can you provide a little more color around your current thoughts on your product development in clinical strategy specifically in the us and if how we should think about rd impact over the next few years and really your eventual goto market strategy and how do you view this product fitting into your overall portfolio and would you kind of look to build a new salesforce around the platform eventually damien mcdonald great question the whole business plan for caisson i really think a few things firstly i think cj and todd and the team have done a tremendous job the results i think speak for themselves the early patience is showing tremendous recovery they’re showing great result in terms of mitral regurgitation score clinically important features like the retrievability have been validated and i think in terms of having a product in early feasibility this is a really great differentiated product again we said the part of the reason that we took the decision now is because we wanted to help the team accelerate and focus on bringing this to market in a commercially accelerated way we think that some of our capabilities in terms of clinical quality and regulatory can help that along as well as manufacturing capability we already have two sites that make tissue valve and then produce also oem for other companies so we have manufacturing capabilities so in terms of rd and manufacturing ramp we think we can really help to chase on to the market in terms of the gotomarket look we’re still early days but clearly having a strong health economics value proposition is going to be important and we’re going to make sure we cover that as we go through the trial interlude trial and the subsequent fda trial but we have again i think good insight into that with our team that we havent placed at livanova we already have a strong relationship with a number of sites and surgeons and also involving set of relationships with cardiologists where perhaps this will ultimately play out with as it did with teva and i think that you could see us easing a hybrid of not only our existing commercial structure in the geographies but also building that out with specific and specialized interventional cardiology reps to deal with this product which is not going to be a simple sale but we think we’ll move along the lines of teva so in terms of gotomarket we’ll use our footprint but augment that with specialists vivid vivid sehgal yes and i just want to answer the question around the rd that you mentioned one of the things really important to understand is that we dont see that the case on deal in diluting our commitment to any other part of our rd portfolio i think we obviously have some great opportunities both damien mentioned in innovation he will talk about at the investor day but also if you look at what we have been doing a new modulation is investing a lot and we’ve taken opportunities to restructure on the line with some of the work that we did on crm so really i think and if you think about the dilution that we’re talking about the  yeah the vast majority of the spend that we have this year and going into the next few years will be in the rd in clinical phase so the vast majority of the spend so then you’re going to see  was a year where we sort of established a portfolio choice on rd i think you’re seeing in  exactly what we said before which is back the focus on rd but we’re not going to dilutes our efforts on any of our focus brands right now cecilia furlong okay thank you so much for all the color and then just kind of sticking transcatheter mitral field in general kind of the true box approach gets thrown around a lot and i believe you previously mentioned equity investments in multiple repair platforms as well and as just following yesterday’s acquisition how you’re looking at building out mitral portfolio damien mcdonald look i think thats a really great question and i think those that i’ve talk to in the recent past you heard talk about surrounding a core point or surrounding a disease state i think that thats really important aspect of how we’re going to be successful we already sell products in the mitral repair and mitral replacement space for surgical repair and replacement i mentioned earlier with scott’s question about we underinvested in those traditional valve repair and replacement areas i think weve got an opportunity to refocus some of our effort there and as vivid said we have them plenty of firepower to do to ma so we think that this is an evolving part of our portfolio certainly caisson puts us in a really strong position we believe in tmvr but we’re going to look to see how the holders restack can be surrounded cecilia furlong great thank you for taking my questions operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of michele baldelli from exane bnp paribas your line is now open michele baldelli hi thank you for taking my question i have two questions on the caisson just understand that we cannot have some data or updates is the europe pcr event meaningful or what is the next event where we can expect some data about it the second question still on caisson is about the reason of the choice about caisson instead of the highlife for other investments was any kind of financial consideration put into place like you needed anyway you expected to do shake of the increase to sustain the rd budget of this company and therefore the agreement was to take out all the company or was it purely only based on clinical data that you can observe it damien mcdonald good morning good afternoon michele so a couple things data the case on the most recent data was in zürich a few weeks ago and that’s the latest update were going to work with the caisson team to be present at the major meetings as a data becomes available or be there is slots on the agenda pcr might be a possibility it depends a lot on how the organizers arrange the agenda so but our attention is to be present at the major events in terms of caisson versus highlife look honestly we really made this decision based on our portfolio decision and looking at what i referred to earlier as irr for the various options we have we’ve looked at this as a whole portfolio approach we really liked not only the financial evaluation of caisson but also the position that they are in terms of their development we continue to really like highlife the guys there have done really good job they have interesting technology and we’re still a financial investor in that company and their options there that are going to be explored as well vivid sehgal i think michele we are again balancing i think what youre seeing from the business right now you see what weve done in terms of the manufacturing some of the work there taking our case somewhere i think we’re going to balance out our own workload and priorities to make sure that we can handle things in an effective way so this is certainly not the end of what we’re going to plan to do but i think we have to do it in a organized and structured way and that’s part of the strategy i think you’re going to see going forward michele baldelli okay thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott bardo from berenberg your line is now open scott bardo yes thanks for taking my question just a followup questions first couple on caisson please i know we still are in a relatively early development stage but can you share some thoughts about the commercial infrastructure required to make this a success and do you think you need heavy sales force investment here or do you genuinely believe there is a lots of synergies with your existing infrastructure and just extending upon that does livanova need to be in cavy to be a winner in mitral damien mcdonald great question scott so commercial investment i think there is two layers to this one is we believe we can leverage our sales force structure that weve recently set up with the regional heads as well as the country managers and country sales leaders so in terms of requiring an entirely new infrastructure we don’t think that’s the case what we will need to do is build out a specialist sales force for this procedure type and the cold point again we believe that’s eminently doable we already have relationships and talent in the cardiac space that we believe will be transferable and again we also believe that the technology is going to be compelling enough to attract some really great talent there are always people in the cardiac and interventional space that i think are looking for the next game changing technology and we believe that we’re going to have that and it will provide an opportunity to attract some tremendous talent in terms of cavy i think that’s a great question we don’t believe its the case there is a case to be made that you need the both we believe that clinicians will want to work with the most compelling clinical proposition and we believe that tmvr will be able to standalone and we think that the caisson product is going to be compelling enough for people want to work with us and so we dont see it as a roadblock to us being successful scott bardo thanks damien and just a housekeeping question on caisson so i mean youve highlighted some additional like are rd and ga cost and vivid you still booking quite a lot of minority and losses if you like from the equity method i think you commented now on making some certain portfolio decisions from the current if you like  million  million that you’re booking where does that go now with this acquisition and on leverage i think in november  you highlighted sga ratio slightly to come down into the low s i appreciate youve just stepped up some investments to   but do you still see good opportunities for leverage over the sga ratio substantially so on the one that you just guided thank you vivid sehgal i think scott yes the first question on the minority interest you will see definitely a reduction on the minority interest so basically what we are doing is switching out from minority interest more into the rd line as you can imagine there is a  previous shareholder within caisson we were booking  of their cost into our minority line so i think if you look at the minority interest line you can probably look at it as perhaps hardening in terms of nature compared to where it has been historically but that’s included within the numbers and the guidance that weve given and i think just on the minority interest as damien said look the cost of that one will depend on where our other ones are in terms of their clinicals and where their investments are but yes if you look at the sort of having it’s about where it will stand in terms of the leverage we do have great opportunities i think as you saw a  basis point improvement in ga versus last year and some further investments that weve done damien puts some effort into the depression within europe and we’ve done some further investments in neuromodulation so weve been investing at the same time that we have actually been bringing our ratios down so again i think we’re going to wait until the investor day to give you more color on the longterm sga and rd ratios but i think the one thing is absolutely clear is that further leverage is possible the answer is yes i think we are we got a great track our synergies are on track and we’re committed to monitoring them and getting there damien mcdonald well we are just being more disciplined vivid sehgal absolutely and we’re looking for opportunities as you seen whether it’s the crm project that we had last year with the manufacturing footprint that we had this year we will look for opportunities to improve our operating leverage scott bardo okay great and perhaps just one last potentially provocative question for damien so damien there has been quite lot of management turnover leaving over and over the last  to  months and there is if you like a perception in the equity market that the worlds are falling off the bus so everyones running for the door and it would be helpful if you could just provide some update if you like and as to all there sufficient channel levels within the organization particularly on the sign side of the business which is the larger to execute if not how do you got about that and can you perhaps talk a little bit about the perception if you like that things are right leaving or given all the management move thank you damien mcdonald yes good question and i would say candidly i think the perspective is wrong i’m a new ceo and i think part of what people should expect me to do is evaluate the talent and ensure that we have the best talent and the focus talent to drive the organization and i have been very lucky in the first few months here to come across some really talented individuals and i hope and expect that a lot of them are going to stay nevertheless i am asking people to work with a different model with more discipline and candidly not everyone – likes that and id rather they’ll make the choice sooner rather than later and i think i have also been able to attract some really tremendous talent and indiscernible who we declared in the opening commentary is an extremely talented commercial leader in europe and latin america and middle east africa there are a number of others that have recently joined we talked a little bit about the search for the new cfo that we hope to be able to speak about soon so i think at the same time as some people have opted out weve also been able to attract some them tremendous talent and people that i have worked with in the past who i know are known commercial leaders or functional leaders with a track record so its the premise i perhaps disagree with and i hope what people see overtime as we have a really strong team scott bardo okay thanks so much indeed and good luck vivid operator thank you i am not showing any further questions at this time ladies and
