redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir

you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear

registered investment advisor portfolio strategy reits mutual fundsmaks financial servicessummarya general update of gbab since our initial lookdetailed discussion of portfolio positions and recent changesdetailed look of the various performance metrics including price total return and net asset value returnsover the last two weeks i have been doing updates on a number of fixed income funds one area of investing which i have mentioned and we have looked at is build america bond investing and we have covered two investments an update on the nuveen build america bond opportunity fund nbd in the article nbd build america and your income and its sister fund the nuveen build america bond fund nbb one fund that i have mentioned in the past and used in the comparison with nbb and nbd is the guggenheim taxable municipal managed duration fund gbab while i have mentioned it in my article ho ho ho merry brexit cefs on sale i have not done a deep look at the fund therefore today i wanted to do that deeper look at the fund and do an update since my initial mention in that article whats new since i have spoke about build america bonds recently i will quote here what i stated in a previous article since our initial article on may th  we have seen the economy eek out another year of gains and the federal reserve was forced to finally raise short term rates long term bonds were negatively impacted with the us aggregate bond index agg being flat to down for the year one investment theory however was that even if rates do rise certain fixed income investments especially those with a higher spread to treasuries would fare better one such investment class are build america bonds a taxable version of municipal bonds source nbd build america and your income fund updates at the time of our initial mention gbab yielded a distribution of  and was trading at a discount of  to its net asset value today gbab yields  and is trading at a discount of  source cef connect looking at the asset allocation we can see gbab differs quite a bit in that only  are invested in municipal bonds and the rest is allocated in a variety of asset classes such as bank loans high yield corporates and asset backed securities source guggenheim investments website looking at the top  holdings we can draw two conclusions the first is that they are seemingly revenue backed such as nj turnpike and westchester medical center secondly the top  represents a bit more than  of the portfolio source guggenheim investments website looking at the state breakdown we can see california represents over  of the portfolio with illinois coming in second with  while state fears are warranted i would caution investors to look at the underlying bonds to determine the risk before investing i would surely look at it more closely if it is an area of concern in short not all ca or il bonds are the same source guggenheim investments website along the same lines we can see that more than  of the portfolios bonds are revenue backed and not general obligation source guggenheim investments website breaking it down further by sectors we can see that schools make up more than  of the portfolio in the short term this does not concern me however longer term absolutely i firmly believe there is a ceiling as to what can be considered affordable for education source guggenheim investments website quality wise we can see that more than  of the portfolio is rated a or better this compares with  for nbb and  for nbd more conservative investors take note those that do not believe in ratings agencies however can disregard source guggenheim investments website finally we can take a look at the statistics on its website guggenheim posts the weighted average duration of  years on cefconnect however the duration figure calculated is  years i suspect the figure provided by guggenheim is not leverage adjusted and the  years figure is correct source guggenheim investments website a very important point of cef investing and one which a number of my awesome followers have requested is the analysis of distributions gbab currently pays a monthly distribution of  as of the latest data the fund has been earning  per share this would imply a coverage ratio of  this bodes in line with the current  in unii unrealizedundistributed net investment income source guggenheim investments website so overall not a bad fund performance update looking at the data since our initial article on  we can see that the fund has returned a total return of  all of that return has been from the distribution as the price per share is actually down  if we look at the underlying portfolio we can see that the portfolios value has actually declined  gbab data by ycharts looking at the ytd data we can see a total return of  and a price per share change of  the underlying nav has increased only  in that same timeframe gbab data by ycharts as we can clearly see the closing of the discount to nav has substantially closed down and helped the total return of the fund next we can take a look at how the fund has performed against its peers since our june article we can see the guggenheim fund leading the way followed by the blackrock taxable municipal bondbab fund bbn followed by the nuveen build america bond opportunity fund nbd the powershares taxable municipal bond etf bab and the nuveen build america bond fund nbb gbab total return price data by ycharts looking at the three year numbers we see the norm so to speak the blackrock and guggenheim funds followed by the two nuveen funds and lastly the unlevered powershares etf gbab total return price data by ycharts over the  year number we see this performance hold up gbab total return price data by ycharts bottom line so absolutely without a doubt the guggenheim fund has been the best performer in the recent past and virtually tied overall with the blackrock fund for the best performance out of our fivesome of bab funds am i surprised not anymore while i have been fully following the two nuveen funds i have not up until now taken a deeper dive in gbab prior to doing this i was actually intrigued as to how you can generate alpha in a fairly commoditized build america bond market looking deeply into the fund you get your answer that answer is you invest in lower quality and bonds other than build america bonds while the two nuveen funds and the powershares etf are more or less pure the guggenheim and blackrock funds can invest  or more in assets other than build america bonds so there is our answer to the question bottom line it is a pretty good fund and up till now the managers have been able to generate incremental returns over its pure peers by adding noncore assets as well as being generally lower quality to the tune of  or more is this good or bad neither it is just different i do think this is a differentiated product and as long as the investors know what they are getting themselves invested in there is nothing inherently wrong with it one other difference between this and the two nuveen funds that we covered is that by nature this is a taxable municipal bond fund and not a build america bond fund unlike the two nuveen funds gbab does not have a determined termination date and it is quite likely that in the future as build america bonds mature or get called this cef will continue on with traditional taxable munis since i have recently published an update on the two nuveen funds and now the guggenheim cef why not turn this into a series over the next few articles i will finish up by looking indepth into the blackrock taxable muni fund bbn and the powershares build america bond etf bab i hope this was helpful in your search for income questions lets keep the conversation going looking for more income ideas check out my previous closed end fund and etf articles if you have not done so already please take a look at my initial mention of gbab in ho ho ho merry brexit cefs on

servicessummarya general update of gbab since our initial lookdetailed discussion of portfolio positions and recent changesdetailed look of the various performance metrics including price total return and net asset value returnsover the last two weeks i have been doing updates on a number of fixed income funds one area of investing which i have mentioned and we have looked at is build america bond investing and we have covered two investments an update on the nuveen build america bond opportunity fund nbd in the article nbd build america and your income and its sister fund the nuveen build america bond fund nbb one fund that i have mentioned in the past and used in the comparison with nbb and nbd is the guggenheim taxable municipal managed duration fund gbab while i have mentioned it in my article ho ho ho merry brexit cefs on sale i have not done a deep look at the fund therefore today i wanted to do that deeper look at the fund and do an update since my initial mention in that article whats new since i have spoke about build america bonds recently i will quote here what i stated in a previous article since our initial article on may th  we have seen the economy eek out another year of gains and the federal reserve was forced to finally raise short term rates long term bonds were negatively impacted with the us aggregate bond index agg being flat to down for the year one investment theory however was that even if rates do rise certain fixed income investments especially those with a higher spread to treasuries would fare better one such investment class are build america bonds a taxable version of municipal bonds source nbd build america and your income fund updates at the time of our initial mention gbab yielded a distribution of  and was trading at a discount of  to its net asset value today gbab yields  and is trading at a discount of  source cef connect looking at the asset allocation we can see gbab differs quite a bit in that only  are invested in municipal bonds and the rest is allocated in a variety of asset classes such as bank loans high yield corporates and asset backed securities source guggenheim investments website looking at the top  holdings we can draw two conclusions the first is that they are seemingly revenue backed such as nj turnpike and westchester medical center secondly the top  represents a bit more than  of the portfolio source guggenheim investments website looking at the state breakdown we can see california represents over  of the portfolio with illinois coming in second with  while state fears are warranted i would caution investors to look at the underlying bonds to determine the risk before investing i would surely look at it more closely if it is an area of concern in short not all ca or il bonds are the same source guggenheim investments website along the same lines we can see that more than  of the portfolios bonds are revenue backed and not general obligation source guggenheim investments website breaking it down further by sectors we can see that schools make up more than  of the portfolio in the short term this does not concern me however longer term absolutely i firmly believe there is a ceiling as to what can be considered affordable for education source guggenheim investments website quality wise we can see that more than  of the portfolio is rated a or better this compares with  for nbb and  for nbd more conservative investors take note those that do not believe in ratings agencies however can disregard source guggenheim investments website finally we can take a look at the statistics on its website guggenheim posts the weighted average duration of  years on cefconnect however the duration figure calculated is  years i suspect the figure provided by guggenheim is not leverage adjusted and the  years figure is correct source guggenheim investments website a very important point of cef investing and one which a number of my awesome followers have requested is the analysis of distributions gbab currently pays a monthly distribution of  as of the latest data the fund has been earning  per share this would imply a coverage ratio of  this bodes in line with the current  in unii unrealizedundistributed net investment income source guggenheim investments website so overall not a bad fund performance update looking at the data since our initial article on  we can see that the fund has returned a total return of  all of that return has been from the distribution as the price per share is actually down  if we look at the underlying portfolio we can see that the portfolios value has actually declined  gbab data by ycharts looking at the ytd data we can see a total return of  and a price per share change of  the underlying nav has increased only  in that same timeframe gbab data by ycharts as we can clearly see the closing of the discount to nav has substantially closed down and helped the total return of the fund next we can take a look at how the fund has performed against its peers since our june article we can see the guggenheim fund leading the way followed by the blackrock taxable municipal bondbab fund bbn followed by the nuveen build america bond opportunity fund nbd the powershares taxable municipal bond etf bab and the nuveen build america bond fund nbb gbab total return price data by ycharts looking at the three year numbers we see the norm so to speak the blackrock and guggenheim funds followed by the two nuveen funds and lastly the unlevered powershares etf gbab total return price data by ycharts over the  year number we see this performance hold up gbab total return price data by ycharts bottom line so absolutely without a doubt the guggenheim fund has been the best performer in the recent past and virtually tied overall with the blackrock fund for the best performance out of our fivesome of bab funds am i surprised not anymore while i have been fully following the two nuveen funds i have not up until now taken a deeper dive in gbab prior to doing this i was actually intrigued as to how you can generate alpha in a fairly commoditized build america bond market looking deeply into the fund you get your answer that answer is you invest in lower quality and bonds other than build america bonds while the two nuveen funds and the powershares etf are more or less pure the guggenheim and blackrock funds can invest  or more in assets other than build america bonds so there is our answer to the question bottom line it is a pretty good fund and up till now the managers have been able to generate incremental returns over its pure peers by adding noncore assets as well as being generally lower quality to the tune of  or more is this good or bad neither it is just different i do think this is a differentiated product and as long as the investors know what they are getting themselves invested in there is nothing inherently wrong with it one other difference between this and the two nuveen funds that we covered is that by nature this is a taxable municipal bond fund and not a build america bond fund unlike the two nuveen funds gbab does not have a determined termination date and it is quite likely that in the future as build america bonds mature or get called this cef will continue on with traditional taxable munis since i have recently published an update on the two nuveen funds and now the guggenheim cef why not turn this into a series over the next few articles i will finish up by looking indepth into the blackrock taxable muni fund bbn and the powershares build america bond etf bab i hope this was helpful in your search for income questions lets keep the conversation going looking for more income ideas check out my previous closed end fund and etf articles

fmsbond  or email us state of munis if corporate tax rates were cut  if corporate tax rates were reduced to say  do you think the municipal bond market would be ok in terms of demand why did fed rates rise and muni rates ease  after the fed raised the benchmark lending rate by  last week why are municipal bond rates off  across all maturities and credit ratings an opportunity during muni redemptions  i have a laddered portfolio of california municipal bonds many of which were purchased in  at or around par most have coupon rates of  and are being redeemed this month in order to reinvest in similar munis i had to pay a  to  premium in your article “summer forecast a muni redemption flood supply drought” you said investors can often enhance their taxfree income when bonds are redeemed with regard to these  bonds i dont see how redemptions arent an issue or how reinvesting in similar bonds can enhance my taxfree income in the decreasingrate environment that has been in place for around  years shouldnt investors hope that older bonds are not redeemed why trust the muni bond rating agencies  moody’s and standard and poor’s proved their fallibility in  and beforetheir ratings are uselesswhy should i trust them now how can puerto rico bonds have aa rating  regarding your article bondholders after puerto rico’s bankruptcy filing i noticed you are still selling puerto rico bonds with an aa listingis there some mysterious way these bonds are safer than the ones i ownhow do they get such a great rating determining the ‘quality’ of a municipal bond  in your recent article muni investors succeed by defying the odds you say investors should look for “quality” municipal bonds first then yield how should i base my determination of quality ratings if so which one do you feel has a better pulse on the muni bond market what to look for – and avoid – in a muni bond broker  we have a “prudentinvestor” broker with another firm who put over  million into puerto rico bonds we almost killed him when we found out what he did now we have to watch him very carefully to make small investments and gain a decent return any advice we have about  million still invested we understand a lot depends on the actions of the current government in puerto rico which is very slow to react premium paid on muni bonds is a return on principal  i have a question about municipal bonds selling at a premium if i buy for example a year facevalue muni bond with a  coupon for  par and pay a  premium over par i pay  to buy the bond when the bond matures i get back  and earn the stated yieldtomaturity when i purchased the bond assume that i can roll over a maturing  bond and use the proceeds to obtain a new bond selling at  to obtain the  premium assume i go into my checking accountisnt the upfront  premium simply returned to me over the life of the bond in the form of a slice of each coupon interest payment that is isnt repayment of the  premium simply a return of my investment  not a return on my investment  medicare part b and taxexempt income  i can sign up for medicare soon and just learned that my rate for part b could be double the minimum most others pay because the government will go back and refigure my taxes and add my taxexempt interest to my income this is very unfair has your company and others that sell bonds been contacting our representatives and trying to get this changed too quick to judge merits of premium muni bonds  i live in a retirement community where the chief financial officer is a volunteer and not educated in investments we have a  million bond portfolio that she manages she buys all fiveyear high yield  to  in todays  market munis with stiff premiums a recent purchase was a  par value  california muni with a fiveyear maturity we live in ca for which she paid over  the whole portfolio is like that please explain why she shouldnt buy premium bonds she wont listen to me or call me crazy and tell me its ok to rack up
