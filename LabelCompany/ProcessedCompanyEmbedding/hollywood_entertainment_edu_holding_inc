inc  notes to condensed financial statements for the six months ended june   and  unaudited   note  – general organization and business   our history and background   we were incorporated in the state of delaware on november   since inception we have been engaged in organizational efforts obtaining financing and establishing the groundwork both in china and in the us to organize training programs for chinese students and participants who wish to pursue higher levels of practical education in the entertainment industry with leading us film schools and colleges we also plan to acquire invest and manage certain compatible training and educational businesses located in china   we were originally formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of or merger with an operating business andor entering into collaboration and joint venture agreements with existing businesses compatible with our core business objectives accordingly we have focused our efforts on identifying possible business combinations acquisitions andor compatible joint ventures and business opportunities and further developing our core business related to the field of entertainment particularly with music motion picture and tv production and animation and in the field of education vocational training and businessfinancial services   in the second half of  the company entered into potential merger discussions with china tactician university company limited “tactician group” which is a hong kong corporation owning a variety of chinese companies involved in a wide range of education and training including vocational training to middle management as well as operating regional colleges a due diligence process has commenced whereby the company will evaluate the audited financial statements of the tactician group which if and when completed may enable the company to work towards a definitive merger agreement at the same time the company also entered into similar potential merger discussions gold street holding china co limited “gold street group” subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence process  the company may proceed with the acquisition of the gold street group there can be no assurance  however this either mergeracquisition will actually be achieved   on april  the company executed a letter of intent with haerbin international tv  film arts academy “hitfaa” which is located in the city of haerbin heilongjiang province  in northeast china under this letter of intent the parties agreed to cooperate to create a resource to train students in the field of film and tv production on may   a chinese joint venture company was formed   owned by the company and  owned by local chinese parties called haerbin leading film  tv entertainment co ltd with the objective of owning  of hitfaa presently no capitalization and no activity has occurred in haerbin leading film  tv entertainment co ltd and there can be no assurance that any capitalization or activity will actually occur   basis of presentation of unaudited condensed   the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” the condensed financial statements of the company as of and for three and six months ended june   and  are unaudited in the opinion of management all adjustments including normal recurring adjustments have been made that are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the company as of june   the results of its operations and its cash flows for the three and six months ended june   and                         hollywood entertainment edu holding inc  notes to financial statements for the six months ended june   and  unaudited   operating results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year the balance sheet at december   has been derived from the company’s audited financial statements included in the form k for the year ended december     going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that the company will continue as a going concern such assumption contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business we have incurred recurring losses from operations and utilized cash flow in operating activities since inception and we have no recurring source of revenue as of june   we have an accumulated deficit of  these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in addition the company’s independent registered public accounting firm in its report on the company’s december   financial statements has raised substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern   management’s plan to support the company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation if we do not raise all of the money we need from public offerings we will have to find alternative sources such as a private placement of securities or loans or advances from our officers directors or others such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term even if the company is able to obtain additional financing it may contain undue restrictions on our operations in the case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders in the case of equity financing   use of estimates   in preparing financial statements management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of operations actual results could differ from those estimates   basic and diluted net loss per share   our computation of earnings per share “eps” includes basic and diluted eps basic eps is measured as the income loss available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period diluted income loss per share reflects the potential dilution using the treasury stock method that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the income loss of the company as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented or issuance date if later in computing diluted income loss per share the treasury stock method assumes that outstanding options and warrants are exercised and the proceeds are used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period   options and warrants may have a dilutive effect under the treasury stock method only when the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise price of the options and warrants potential common shares that have an antidilutive effect ie those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share are excluded from the calculation of diluted eps                      hollywood entertainment edu holding inc  notes to financial statements for the six months ended june   and  unaudited   income loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective periods basic and diluted loss per common share is the same for periods in which the company reported an operating loss because all warrants and stock options outstanding are antidilutive as of june   there were no potential dilutive securities   fair value of financial instruments   the fasb asc  “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” requires the determination of fair value of the company’s financial assets and liabilities the estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies the carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and advances from officer approximate their fair value because of their short maturities   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes accordingly the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized   in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made likewise should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the period such determination was made   the company is subject to us federal income taxes and income taxes of various state tax jurisdictions as the company’s net operating losses have yet to be utilized all previous tax years remain open to examination by federal authorities and other jurisdictions in which the company currently operates or has operated in the past the company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of june   and  and does not anticipate any material amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next  months   the company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by gaap the tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is “morelikelythannot” to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the reporting date if the tax position is not considered “morelikelythannot” to be sustained then no benefits of the position are recognized as of june   the company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions in subsequent periods any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component of income tax expense   no current provision or benefit for federal income taxes has been recorded for the three months ended june   or for any period from inception through june   as the company has no taxable income                      hollywood entertainment edu holding inc  notes to financial statements for the six months ended june
