partners supports an evaluation of rosetta stones strategic alternatives jun    et from osmium partners llc greenbrae calif june   prnewswire  given recent ma activity osmium partners osmium believes a strategic buyer should pay at least  per share if  or better is not achievable after evaluating strategic alternatives osmium is very supportive of the current leadership and business strategy and rosetta stone should stay independent  dear fellow shareholders osmium partners is the second largest shareholder of rosetta stone inc nyse rst owning approximately  of the shares outstanding we are not surprised by the current stock price of the company given the recent changes in strategy management and new board leadership however we believe the company is significantly undervalued given the business model shift value of the underlying assets and recent comparable transactions osmium believes rosetta stones shares could transact to a strategic buyer at a price of  per share or better therefore osmium encourages an evaluation of strategic alternatives since the  ipo of the company we believe the sellside and investment community has viewed rosetta stone as a dying cd business while overlooking the growing saas based institutional enterprise and education ee business rosetta stones ee business has grown from  million in  to  million in revenue on a trailing twelvemonth basis with  guidance from the company of  million in bookings as further discussed below osmium notes that there has been five recent comparable acquisitions by strategic buyers ranging from x  x total enterprise value tevrevenue what makes the ee business so valuable rosetta stones ee business has several characteristics attractive to strategic buyers  softwareasaservice web based subscription offering  annual customer renewal rates as of march   the ee business has posted trailing twelvemonth revenue of  million with  bookings guidance of   million in  gross margins overall were approximately  implying  million in gross profit dollars for the ee business as shown in the table of transaction values below strategic buyers and private equity firms have found significant value in contractually obligated software revenue streams year target acquirer tevrevenue transaction size  scholastics educational technology and services business houghton mifflin harcourt x  mm  renaissance learning hellman  friedman x  bn  globalenglish pearson plc x  mm  archipelago learning plato learning x  mm  blackboard providence equity partners x  bn  renaissance learning permira x  mm median x  mm in early  banks such as bank of america credit suisse and rbc capital markets provided financing to hellman  friedmans  billion acquisition of renaissance learning a company with similar characteristics to rosetta stone  renaissance learnings leverage ratio rose to x ebitda after it was purchased osmium believes strategic buyers would model significant synergies from a transaction rosetta stone has one of the worlds best known languagelearning brands rosetta stone is in over  schools – two potential acquirers in our judgment each have approximately  schools competitors have similar saas based platforms but very limited if any saas based languagelearning products to sell into their respective school bases ee segment also houses lexia learning a highly acclaimed literacy product two potential acquirers have four to five times the sales force of rosetta stone netnet osmium believes there would be a significant cross selling opportunity into a school base four times greater than rosetta stones current base with little to no overlap of existing products and a much larger sales force across a scalable saas based platform ee segment valuation in arriving at our conclusion of a possible current valuation for rosetta stone we made several assumptions specific to the ee business we believe that a strategic buyer could generate  ebitda margins on top of an existing saas based platform or at least  million dollars in incremental ebitda based on current twelvemonth trailing revenue if financed on similar terms to the recent renaissance learning transaction we believe rosetta stone could be  bank financed without any out of pocket equity from a strategic buyer to be conservative we assumed no benefits in cross selling a new suite of high quality brands in literacy and language learning into an installed school base that is four times the size of rosetta stones current base assumed no benefit from employing a sales force that is four times that of rosetta stones valued the ee business at x our estimate of ebitda flow through that a strategic buyer would be able to attain reflecting a  discount to median market transactions and a x  trailing gaap revenue consumer segment valuation in addition to the ee business osmium believes that under proper care and supervision rosetta stones consumer franchise is also a valuable asset  we believe the company has an enormously wellknown and trusted brand due to spending approximately  billion in sales  marketing and  million in rd since   rosetta stone brand has  aided awareness and unaided awareness of  vs  for the next closest competitor the consumerfacing business contains assets such as language learning kids learning fit brains a leader in braintraining software second only to lumosity acquired for  million and livemocha leading social online community for language learners acquired for  million with a run rate of approximately  million in annual bookings osmium understands these businesses may shrink in the near term but we believe the rosetta stone consumer business in a sale is worth  x tevrevenue or slightly over  million dollars finally rosetta stones consumer business has grown its saasbased platform from  subscribers in q to  as of q with a revenue run rate of  million given  rosetta stones mix of worldclass branding  two valuable business units in consumer and ee and  substantial growth in rosetta stones lexia learning we believe rosetta stone could achieve a median x tevrevenue type valuation currently translating to a share price of  per share segment value per share ee consumer cash share price premium low x tevrevenue      median x tevrevenue      high x tevrevenue      potential strategic buyers following are several companies osmium believes could be potential acquirers of rosetta stone strategic acquirer   strategic fit with houghton mifflin harcourt company interest in entering  bn selfstudy language learning market

holdings inc technology addon offering to traditional berlitz language center iacinteractivecorp crosssell opportunities with tutorcom where  of revenues come from contracts with institutions and princeton review graham holdings company added offering to kaplan k learning services catalog and kaplan international english the walt disney company disney interactive and disney english which is a subsidiary of disney publishing acquisition premiums in small cap markets small public companies typically have  limited wall street analyst coverage fewer institutional investors and thin investor level patience for strategy shifts or leadership changes  we believe these factors  drive significant share price volatility and temporarily create significantly undervalued publicly traded businesses  this opportunity in many cases is not lost on strategic buyers that are willing to pay significant premiums to market while still buying an asset that is significantly accretive to the acquirers bottom line some recent notable examples geeknet was priced at  per share in may  and received two offers for the company by hot topic and gamestop gamestop ended up paying  per share in cash a week later representing a  market premium ziprealty was priced at  per share in july  and realogy paid  in a cash transaction for a one day market premium of  in the us markets in  and  alone we note that  companies with average market capitalizations of less than  million have been acquired with a one day premium to market changes of at least  given these premiums paid we would not be surprised to get to a teens share price in a sale process conclusion we appreciate the recent actions that the board of directors of the company has taken to focus the company on its most valuable assets to drive shareholder value recent actions include fall  adding directors caroline tsay steve yankovich and john hass early spring  total organizational focus on maximizing value of the ee business and appointing john hass as interim ceo late spring  addition of expert al angrisani to the transition team as well as noted investor david nierenberg to the board  rosetta stone appears to be at a key inflection point  we are excited to be shareholders with an engaged team that has a renewed focus on the serious learners a customer segment which purchase longerterm recurring subscriptions with over  million in gross profit in  we believe that there is no shortage of opportunities to allocate capital into a software brand that has significant name recognition and growth opportunities we believe
