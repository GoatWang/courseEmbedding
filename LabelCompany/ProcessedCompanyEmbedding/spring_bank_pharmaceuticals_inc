under risk factors beginning on page s of this prospectus supplement and the risk factors section of our annual report on form k for the year ended december   along with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements before making an investment decision about spring bank pharmaceuticals         we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid or smnh chemistry platform our smnh compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we design to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states we are developing our most advanced smnh product candidate sb  for the treatment of certain viral diseases we have designed sb  to selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins retinoic acidinducible gene  rigi and nucleotidebinding oligomerization domaincontaining protein  nod to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense we believe that sb  may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the bodys immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral infections we are also developing other smnh product candidates including sb  an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the stimulator of interferon genes or sting pathway sb          we are currently developing sb  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus or hbv we are conducting a phase a multicenter clinical trial of sb  in canada hong kong korea and taiwan which is the first segment of our phase  achieve trial the phase a trial is a randomized placebocontrolled multiple ascending dose trial in up to  noncirrhotic patients infected with chronic hbv using doses of  mg  mg  mg and  mg of sb  as a monotherapy administered daily for  weeks following this treatment all patients will receive treatment with the oral antiviral agent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate marketed as viread® which we refer to as viread as a monotherapy for  weeks patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between a sb  dose group or placebo on a  basis patients are stratified based on hbeag positive  or negative  status hbeag is a nonstructural protein which is secreted by the virus and whose presence in blood or hbeagpositive is indicative of wild type or nonmutated virus with high levels of viral replication the loss of hbeag occurs secondary to mutations in the virus and results in a patient becoming hbeag negative with a resulting lower level of actively replicating virus the primary endpoints of the phase a clinical trial are safety and antiviral activity as measured by the change in hbv dna at week  from baseline multiple exploratory secondary endpoints include reduction or loss of hepatitis b surface antigen or hbsag and hbeag quantitative hbv rna as a marker for control of virus production and studies of immune activity         in may  we reported topline results from the first sb  monotherapy dosing cohort of the phase a clinical trial indicating that a low dose mg of sb  alone showed a favorable safety profile and antiviral activity against hbv dna and hbsag the first sb  monotherapy dosing cohort consisted of  hbeagpositive and  hbeagnegative patients of which  were genotype bc the most common asian genotypes administration of sb  resulted in a statistically s table of contents significant reduction in hbv dna at week  unpaired ttest  p compared to placebo with a mean reduction of  log  range  to  log   in the sb  treatment group for the secondary endpoint of reduction or loss of hbsag  of  patients  in the sb  treatment group had a greater than  log  reduction at any time point range  to  log   compared to none in the placebo group the  hbeagnegative patients in the sb  treatment group had the greatest mean reduction in hbv dna at  log   and  of these  patients also had a greater than  log  reduction in hbsag the overall safety profile of sb  was favorable and over the week study no serious adverse events were observed treatmentemergent adverse events ranged from mild to moderate in severity with no interferonlike side effects and were comparable to patients on placebo         we expect to report topline results from the second sb  monotherapy dosing cohort of the phase a clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  and to report topline monotherapy results for all patients treated with sb  alone in the first half of  subject to the complete results of the phase a clinical trial we expect to initiate a phase b clinical trial in the second half of  in patients with chronic hbv to explore the use of sb  as a monotherapy and in combination with viread the phase a clinical trial is being conducted under our clinical trial collaboration with gilead sciences inc and the phase b clinical trial will be conducted under the same collaboration         we are also pursuing the development of the coformulation of sb  with viread and with entecavir marketed as baraclude® which we refer to as baraclude as potential fixeddose combination products for the treatment of patients with chronic hbv who may benefit from the combined use of sb  as a potential immunomodulatory agent and baraclude or viread as the antiviral agent we anticipate that the fixeddose combination product could result in enhanced patient compliance and potentially allow for a more favorable safety profile we have conducted early development work on coformulations with viread and believe that sb  with viread is compatible in the same formulation we believe that the immunomodulatory activity provided by sb  could become a key component of a future combinatorial treatment of patients infected with chronic hbv which could increase the percentage of chronic hbv patients who achieve a functional cure we have entered into collaborations and seek to enter into additional collaborations with third parties that are investigating andor developing compounds for the treatment of chronic hbv with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than sb  pursuant to this strategy we have entered into agreements with multiple parties including arrowhead pharmaceuticals inc and arbutus biopharma corporation sb          we are developing sb  a novel proprietary sting agonist as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the sting pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote an aggressive and strong antitumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune response in our preclinical studies performed in in vitro systems sb  has been observed to cause the induction of interferon and other cytokines as well as cell death or apoptosis of multiple tumorderived cell lines we continue to conduct preclinical studies of sb  in multiple in vivo cancer models we presented data from in vivo studies in the a lymphoma and t breast cancer syngeneic mouse models at the march  cancer immunology and immunotherapy keystone symposia in june  an abstract was published at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting indicating that sb  showed potent and highlydurable antitumor activity in the a and ct syngeneic mouse tumor models the induction of immunememory and abscopal antitumor activity upon intratumoral administration of sb  was also observed in the a lymphoma model in addition sb  exhibited dosedependent potent tumor growth inhibition and durable antitumor response upon intratumoral intraperitoneal and intravenous routes of administration in the ct colon cancer syngeneic mouse model in the orthotopic t breast cancer model intraperitoneal administration of sb  resulted in significant s table of contents inhibition of primary tumor growth as well as inhibition of tumor metastasis we believe these preclinical studies demonstrate the potential for both intratumoral and systemic administration of sb  to target a variety of tumors which could potentially be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities         we intend to continue the development of sb  as a potentially important addition to the current standard of care in the treatment of various cancers that we believe could increase the treatment responses in patients in  we intend to continue to advance the sb  program with preclinical toxicology and process development efforts and hope to achieve further preclinical proofofprinciple for sb  in relevant oncology models subject to the results of these preclinical studies we hope to submit an investigational new drug application or ind andor a clinical trial

or more us persons have the authority to control all of the trusts substantial decisions or  the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable us treasury regulations to be treated as a us person         this discussion is based on current provisions of the code existing and proposed us treasury regulations promulgated thereunder current administrative rulings and judicial decisions all as in effect as of the date of this prospectus supplement all of which are subject to change or to differing interpretation possibly with retroactive effect any change could alter the tax consequences to nonus holders described in this prospectus supplement in addition there can be no assurance that the internal revenue service which we refer to as the irs will not challenge one or more of the tax consequences described herein we assume in this discussion that a nonus holder holds shares of our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of section  of the code generally property held for investment         this discussion does not address all aspects of us federal income and estate taxation that may be relevant to a particular nonus holder in light of that nonus holders individual circumstances nor does it address the alternative minimum tax the medicare tax on net investment income or any aspects of us state local or nonus taxes this discussion also does not consider any

to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles if a distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits the excess will be treated as a taxfree return of the nonus holders investment up to such holders tax basis in the common stock any remaining excess will be treated as capital gain subject to the tax treatment described below in gain on sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock any such distributions will also be subject to the discussion below under the section titled

be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the united states and such holders country of residence a nonus holder of our common stock who claims the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty between the united states and such holders country of residence generally will be required to provide a properly executed irs form wben or wbene or successor form and satisfy applicable certification and other requirements a nonus holder that is eligible for a reduced rate of us withholding tax under an income tax treaty may be able to obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts

        dividends that are treated as effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by a nonus holder within the united states and if an applicable income tax treaty so provides that are attributable to a permanent establishment or a fixed base maintained by the nonus holder within the united states are generally exempt from the  withholding tax if the nonus holder satisfies applicable certification and disclosure requirements however such us effectively connected income net of specified deductions and credits is generally taxed at the same graduated us federal income tax rates applicable to united states persons as defined in the code any us effectively connected income received by a nonus holder that is a corporation may also under certain circumstances be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the united states and such holders country of residence gain on sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock         subject to the discussion below under withholding and information reporting requirementsfatca in general a nonus holder will not be subject to any us federal income tax on any gain realized upon such holders sale exchange or other taxable disposition of shares of our common stock unless  the gain is effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a us trade or business and if an applicable income tax treaty so provides is attributable to a permanent establishment s table of contents or a fixed base maintained by such nonus holder in the united states in which case the nonus holder generally will be taxed at the graduated us federal income tax rates applicable to united states persons as defined in the code and if the nonus holder is a foreign corporation the branch profits tax described above in distributions on our common stock also may apply  the nonus holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for  days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met in which case the nonus holder will be subject to a  tax or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty between the united states and such holders country of residence on the net gain derived from the disposition which may be offset by certain us source capital losses of the nonus holder if any or  we are or have been at any time during the fiveyear period preceding such disposition or the nonus holders holding period if shorter a us real property holding corporation unless our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market and the nonus holder holds no more than  of our outstanding common stock directly or indirectly during the shorter of the year period ending on the date of the disposition or the period that the nonus holder held our common stock if we are determined to be a us real property holding corporation and the foregoing exception does not apply then the nonus holder generally will be taxed on its net gain derived from the disposition at the graduated us federal income tax rates applicable to united states persons as defined in the code generally a corporation is a us real property holding corporation only if the fair market value of its us real property interests equals or exceeds  of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests plus its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business although there can be no assurance we do not believe that we are or have been a us real property holding corporation or that we are likely to become one in the future no assurance can be provided that our common stock will be regularly traded on an established securities market for purposes of the rules described above backup withholding and information reporting         we must report annually to the irs and to each nonus holder the gross amount of the distributions on our common stock paid to such holder and the tax withheld if any with respect to such distributions nonus holders may have to comply with specific certification procedures to establish that the holder is not a united states person as defined in the code in order to avoid backup withholding at the applicable rate with respect to dividends on our common stock generally a nonus holder will comply with such procedures if it provides a properly executed irs form wben or wbene or other applicable form w or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a nonus holder or otherwise establishes an exemption dividends paid to nonus holders subject to withholding of us federal income tax as described above in distributions on our common stock generally will be exempt from us backup withholding         information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to the proceeds of a disposition of our common stock by a nonus holder effected by or through the us office of any broker us or foreign unless the holder certifies its status as a nonus holder and satisfies certain other requirements or otherwise establishes an exemption generally information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a nonus holder where the transaction is effected outside the united states through a nonus office of a broker however for information reporting purposes dispositions effected through a nonus office of a broker with substantial us ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to dispositions s table of contents effected through a us office of a broker nonus holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them         copies of information returns may be made available to the tax authorities of the country in which the nonus holder resides or is incorporated under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement         backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a nonus holder can be refunded or credited against the nonus holders us federal income tax liability if any provided that an appropriate claim is timely filed with the irs withholding and information reporting

from a sale or other disposition of our common stock made after december   an intergovernmental agreement between the united states and an applicable foreign country may modify the fatca rules described above nonus holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of fatca on nonus holders investment in our common stock and the entities including financial intermediaries through which they hold our common stock us federal estate tax         shares of our common stock that are owned or treated as owned at the time of death by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the united states as specifically defined for us federal estate tax purposes are considered us situs assets and will be included in the individuals gross estate for us federal

bank pharmaceuticals         we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using our proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid or smnh chemistry platform our smnh compounds are small segments of nucleic acids that we design to selectively target and modulate the activity of specific proteins implicated in various disease states we are developing our most advanced smnh product candidate sb  for the treatment of certain viral diseases we have designed sb  to selectively activate within infected cells the cellular proteins retinoic acidinducible gene  rigi and nucleotidebinding oligomerization domaincontaining protein  nod to inhibit viral replication and to cause the induction of intracellular interferon signaling pathways for antiviral defense we believe that sb  may play an important role in antiviral therapy by modulating the bodys immune response through its mechanisms of action to fight viral infections we are also developing other smnh product candidates including sb  an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers through the activation of the stimulator of interferon genes or sting pathway sb          we are currently developing sb  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus or hbv we are conducting a phase a multicenter clinical trial of sb  in canada hong kong korea and taiwan the trial is a randomized placebocontrolled multiple ascending dose trial in up to  noncirrhotic patients infected with chronic hbv using doses of  mg  mg  mg and  mg of sb  as a monotherapy administered daily for  weeks following this treatment all patients will receive treatment with the oral antiviral agent tenofovir disoproxil fumarate marketed as viread® which we refer to as viread as a monotherapy for  weeks patients will be sequentially enrolled into one of the four dose cohorts and randomized between a sb  dose group or placebo on a  basis patients will be stratified based on hbeag status hbeag is a nonstructural protein whose presence in blood or hbeag is indicative of actively replicating virus the primary endpoints of the phase a clinical trial are safety and reduction in hbv dna from pretreatment levels with multiple exploratory secondary endpoints including reduction or loss of hepatitis b surface antigen or hbsag and hbeag both of which are important markers of viral replication and early surrogate markers for functional cure in june  we initiated our phase a achieve clinical trial in noncirrhotic patients infected with chronic hbv and in may  we reported topline results from the first sb  monotherapy dosing cohort of the phase a clinical trial which indicated that a low dose mg of sb  alone showed a favorable safety profile and antiviral activity against hbv dna and hbsag         we are also pursuing the development of the coformulation of sb  with entecavir marketed as baraclude® which we refer to as baraclude and viread as potential fixeddose combination products for the treatment of patients with chronic hbv who may benefit from the combined use of  table of contents sb  as an immunomodulatory agent and baraclude or viread as the antiviral agent we anticipate that the fixeddose combination product could result in enhanced patient compliance and potentially allow for the delivery of lower doses of the individual compounds for equivalent efficacy and a more favorable safety profile we have conducted early development work on coformulations with baraclude and viread and believe that sb  and these antiviral agents are compatible in the same formulation we believe that the immunomodulatory activity provided by sb  could be a key component of a future combinatorial treatment of patients infected with chronic hbv which could increase the percentage of chronic hbv patients who achieve a functional cure we have entered into collaborations and seek to enter into additional collaborations with third parties that are investigating andor developing compounds for the treatment of chronic hbv with different pharmacological mechanisms of action than sb  pursuant to this strategy we entered into agreements with arrowhead pharmaceuticals inc and arbutus biopharma corporation sb          we are developing sb  a novel proprietary sting agonist as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of selected cancers recent published scientific literature indicates that the activation of the sting pathway can result in the induction of cellular interferons and cytokines and promote an aggressive and strong antitumor response through the induction of innate and adaptive immune response in our studies performed in in vitro cancer models sb  was shown to cause the induction of interferon and other cytokines and cell death or apoptosis of multiple tumorderived cell lines we continue to conduct preclinical studies of sb  in multiple in vivo cancer models in march  we presented data from certain of these in vivo studies at the  keystone symposia on cancer immunology and immunotherapy indicating that sb  showed antitumor activity in a t breast cancer syngeneic mouse model and an a lymphoma model additional information         for additional information related to our business and operations please refer to the reports incorporated herein by reference including our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as described under the caption incorporation of documents by reference on page  of this prospectus risks associated with our business         our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including those highlighted in the section entitled risk factors immediately following this prospectus summary some of these risks are  we have a history of limited operations have incurred significant losses since our inception expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability  we will need additional funding to complete the development of our product candidates and if our products are approved by the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities before we can expect to become profitable from the commercial sale of our products if we are unable to raise capital when needed we could be forced to delay reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts  our business currently depends substantially on the success of clinical trials for sb  which is still under development if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize sb  our business will be materially harmed  we are very early in our development efforts and our product candidates may not be successful in later stage clinical trials as a result they may never be approved as marketable therapeutics  table of contents  we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing these third parties may not perform satisfactorily which could delay our product development activities  if we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or obtain and maintain issued patents which are sufficient to protect our product candidates others could compete against us more directly which would have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects and  we may not be able to retain key executives or to attract retain and motivate key personnel         it is

own nominees  classified board   our restated certificate of incorporation and proposed restated bylaws provide that our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors the existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority control of our board of directors and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror pursuant to

without further action by the stockholders to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences including voting rights designated from time to time by the board of directors the existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock enables our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise  exclusive forum   our restated certificate of incorporation specifies that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of the corporation to the corporation or the corporations stockholders iii any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the dgcl and iv any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law by chancellors particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes efficient administration of cases on a more expedited schedule relative to other forums and protection against the burdens of multiforum litigation however the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with any applicable action brought against us a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action limitation of liability and indemnification         as permitted by delaware law we have adopted provisions in our certificate of incorporation that limit or eliminate the personal liability of our directors our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted by delaware law delaware law provides that directors of a corporation will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breaches of their fiduciary duties as directors except liability for  any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders  any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law  table of contents  any unlawful payments related to dividends or unlawful stock repurchases redemptions or other distributions or  any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit         these limitations do not apply to liabilities arising under federal securities laws and do not affect the availability of equitable remedies including injunctive relief or rescission if delaware law is amended to authorize the further elimination or limiting of a director then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law as so amended         as permitted by delaware law our certificate of incorporation also provides that  we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law  we may indemnify our other employees and other agents to the same extent that we indemnify our officers and directors unless otherwise determined by our board of directors and  we will advance expenses to our directors and officers in connection with legal proceedings in connection with a legal proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by law         the indemnification provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation are not exclusive in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers each of these indemnification agreements provides among other things that we will indemnify such director or executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by law for claims arising in his or her capacity as a director or officer as applicable provided that he or she acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to our best interests and with respect to any criminal proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful each of these indemnification agreements provide that in the event that we do not assume the defense of a claim against a director or officer as applicable we will be required to advance his or her expenses in connection with his or her defense provided that he or she undertakes to repay all amounts advanced if it is ultimately determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by us         we believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act of  which we refer to as the securities act may be permitted to directors officers or persons controlling our company pursuant to the foregoing provisions we understand that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable         in addition we maintain standard policies of insurance under which coverage is provided to our directors and officers against losses arising from claims made by reason of breach of duty or other wrongful act and to us with respect to payments which may be made by us to such directors and officers pursuant to the above indemnification provisions or otherwise as a matter of law         the foregoing discussion of our restated certificate of incorporation restated bylaws indemnification agreements and delaware law is not intended to be exhaustive and is qualified in its entirety by such restated certificate of incorporation restated bylaws indemnification agreements or law         insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to our directors officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise we have been advised that in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act and is therefore unenforceable  table of contents legal matters         mintz levin cohn ferris glovsky and popeo pc boston
