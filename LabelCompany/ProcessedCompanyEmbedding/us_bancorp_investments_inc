managed options can open the investment world to youoverviewis it right for mehow to get startedfaqstodays investment markets provide more opportunity than ever before but the seemingly endless array of investment options can overwhelm individuals trying to make informed investment decisions on their own financial professionals at us bank and us bancorp investments inc offer a consultative approach to investment management an advisor works as your partner in helping you understand the options available in today’s wideranging investment marketplace your advisor builds the investment process around you your goals and individual circumstances that affect your approach to money management and investing by gaining a comprehensive understanding of you as an investor your advisor is able to create a customized investment strategy that is consistent with your goals the centerpiece of that plan is a personalized asset allocation strategy you can choose from a variety of professionally managed investment programs here’s an overview of each phase of the investment management cycle see more we start by creating your personal profile this involves analyzing your financial needs and goals considering your current situation and investment time frame as well as your attitudes about investment risk next we develop your asset allocation strategy well work together to develop an investment strategy based on your profile to allocate your assets a welldiversified portfolio may combine different types of assets to attempt to achieve specific investment goals while potentially reducing overall portfolio risk then we implement your portfolio to set your plan in motion well screen and recommend a combination of investment products based on how their performance and risk characteristics align with your circumstances and goals you can choose from a full range of investment options including stocks bonds and mutual funds fixed and variablerate annuities exchangetraded funds etfs and unit investment trusts uits professionallymanaged portfolios read about financial contributions from product partners for mutual funds fixed annuities and variable annuities we manage your portfolio on an ongoing basis working with you well continuously monitor your portfolio’s performance modifications including rebalancing can be made to the portfolio based on developments in the market well review progress regularly youll hear from your advisor on a regular basis throughout the year you’ll also receive regular performance reports and information alerting you to changes in your portfolio and factors that may affect your financial goals and investment strategy like a good tax advisor or an attorney a trusted financial professional can help you stay on track – and help simplify your life professionally managed investment portfolios take a disciplined approach to investing but provide the flexibility to choose your level of involvement in the investment decisionmaking process by working with financial professionals at either us bank or us bancorp investments inc you may benefit from peace of mind in knowing that your investments are being managed and monitored by an experienced professional investment strategies tailored to your specific goals and circumstances ongoing support and monitoring of your investment progress the flexibility to modify your investment strategy as your needs and goals evolve and more time for you to spend on other aspects of your life to make informed decisions about your financial future you need to understand your options knowledgeable professionals at us bank and us bancorp investments inc can help simplify your financial life by creating a customized plan and monitoring its progress for you what are the strategies for successful investingit’s important to know who you are as an investor and what you want your portfolio to accomplish the key steps include identifying specific financial goals these may include funding a child’s higher education your own retirement the purchase of a home starting a business or other goals that are important to you assessing the amount of time you have to achieve each goal setting time frames for each of your goals is key because it can help determine how long your money can keep working for you understanding your own risk tolerance some investors are risk takers by nature while others are very conservative but many fall somewhere in between age personality investment experience and financial circumstance can all affect your tolerance for risk determining your asset allocation – in other words the mix of assets you want to own across various classes of investments diversification may help reduce your overall risk your asset allocation strategy should support your goals while being consistent with your risk tolerance level taking the time to review your overall portfolio performance keeping your eye on the big picture if your portfolio begins to drift from your asset allocation strategy you may consider rebalancing your portfolio to maintain your longterm investment strategy making adjustments to your portfolio if your needs and circumstances change why do i need to diversify my portfolioa diversified portfolio spreads investment dollars out over a variety of asset classes andor different securities the goal of diversification is to help protect the value of your overall portfolio against a decline of price in a single security andor a market sector for example some investors own a mix of stocks and bonds with the expectation that in times when stock markets decline bonds will perform better helping to minimize the volatility of the overall portfolio the different asset classes may counterbalance one another to help reduce shortterm fluctuation in the portfolio of course asset allocation and diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a losswhy is it important to focus on asset allocation as part of the investment processstudies show that asset allocation has the single largest impact on your account’s overall performance according to  nobel prize winner harry markowitz’s “modern portfolio theory” almost  of investment returns are the result of how assets are allocated among different classes while only  are due to the specific stocks and bonds you choose to buy within each asset class asset allocation may have a more significant affect on performance returns than industry weighting stock selection market timing or any other portfolio management decisionhow often should i make adjustments to my asset allocationyour asset allocation should reflect your current investment objectives but it is also a longterm commitment if your objectives and investment timeframe have not changed you may not want to make adjustments to your asset mix this is true even if shortterm developments in the market are not working to your benefit but if things have changed the investment mix that suited you when you began investing may not be appropriate today major changes in your personal life financial situation and time horizon can all be reasons to reconsider your asset allocation strategywhat does it mean to rebalance a portfolio and why is that importantyour asset allocation strategy is based on specific objectives for investment return consistent with your acceptable level of risk if over time the performance of certain types of assets held in your portfolio dramatically stray from expected return levels it’s possible that you may find that you are significantly overinvested or underinvested in specific asset classes for example if due to strong performance a planned  weighting of international stocks in your portfolio grows to a  weighting you may suddenly be taking on significantly more risk by owning more international stocks than your original allocation called for if that occurs you may consider rebalancing assets in your portfolio to the weighting specified in your original asset allocation strategyis there a cost to having my investments professionally managedyes your advisor will discuss the costs involved before you decide to become a clientwhat products are available within these managed accountsdepending on your specific situation portfolios may include all types of mutual funds exchangetraded funds etfs individual stocks bonds and other securities or other types of investments available on the open market part of the process of working with an investment advisor is to determine which products may fit your asset
