december            bologna is a product not usually associated with french food but this week in paris more bologna is being produced than most people could consume in a lifetime i’m not speaking of the food we like in sadwiches but the socalled “climate change summit” which is producing more apocalyptic language than is found in scripture french president hollande says “the future of the planet the future of life” is at stake          this is all about more government control over our lives there is plenty of scientific evidence that disproves the claims of the global warming alarmists but the mainstream media suppress it because to them government is god no matter how many times their deity fails to reciprocate their faith          a new film premieres in paris next week it’s called “climate hustle” i urge you to see it should it appear in a theater near you or possibly online at climatedepotcom it shows the false predictions of the past and presents scientific evidence the alarmists are basing predictions on computer models not actual measurements have a bologna sandwich for lunch but don’t consume the bologna coming out of paris i’m cal thomas order cals new book what

one of americas favorite lunch meats what is bologna anyway as we took to google to decipher exactly what you wanted to know most about bologna we realized that you had some fairly normal questions and also some rather irregular ones all totally reasonable wait cats dogs are that many of you considering sharing your bologna sandwiches with your pets sorry did you say cake we tried to get to the bottom of these without further ado your five most burning bologna questions answered  where does bologna come from getty bologna comes from bologna  italy that is although if you ask for bologna there no one will know what you are talking about what youll end up with is mortadella the italian godfather of american baloney mortadella is a thick italian sausage flecked with bits of fat peppercorns and sometimes pistachios mortadella is to bologna as fresh roasted turkey on thanksgiving is to sliced turkey lunchmeat  why doesnt american bologna look like mortadella getty for bologna made and commercially sold in the us like hot dogs which are lumped into the same category the usda says the product must be comminuted or reduced to minute particles that means you cant be able to recognize any flecks of lard spices etc in your bologna and it must be uniform thats right meat paste  whats in bologna getty usually pork sometimes beef sometimes both bologna is a sausage so it starts as a blend of meat fat salt and spices which are then stuffed into a casing and smoked companies that produce bologna tend be very cagey about their ingredient list since the trimmings that go into it occasionally come from parts of the animal that make people want to faint they are also protective of their particular blend of spices which are conveniently allowed to just be listed as spices on nutrition labelsmost mortadella and bologna are seasoned with some blend of the following black pepper myrtle berries nutmeg allspice celery seed and coriander if you just thought to yourself oh pickling spices youd be exactly right except for the myrtle berry which is the wildcard that gives bologna that recognizable je ne sais quoiif you dont believe me go get yourself a bottle of mirto a traditional sardinian digestif made from myrtle berries and tell me it doesnt kind of taste like bologna  is bologna healthy flickr stuspivack well no it is as healthy for you as any sausage which is blend of animal fat and meat with salt spices and preservative agents i am sorry to report that one of the best ways to eat bologna happens to be fried which id actually endorse at least once go big or go home right it does appear that most commercial bologna is glutenfree if youre into that kind of thing im not sure why it wouldnt be but a lot of you seemed to want to know i

soil and water conservation and also to reduce pollution the farmers who grow organic produce dont use what would be considered conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds for example organic farming practices would include the use of natural fertilizers to feed the soil and plants while using crop rotation or mulch to manage the weeds so what makes a product organic for certain the us department of agriculture usda established a certification program that requires all organiclabeled foods to meet strict government standards first these standards regulate how such foods are grown
