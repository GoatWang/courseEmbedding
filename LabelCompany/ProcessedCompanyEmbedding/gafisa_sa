nowgo»gafisa what is the current situationnov   about gafisa sa gfa daniel gilcher value special situations long onlysummarywe introduce gafisa and discuss recent news about the companywe analyze its recent fundamental data in relation to past performancewe find that gafisa is a stable company trading at interesting pricesthis article discusses the recent situation at gafisa sa nysegfa it is our goal to grow the understanding of the company under the latest developments and hence to support possible investment decisions introduction gafisa is the third largest company in brazil developing constructing and selling mainly private housing projects the company is in the business for more than  years and is also listed in the indice bovespa brazils most important index gafisa sas business is generally separated in two different units a gafisa and b tenda it also holds a  stake in the company alphaville while the gafisa unit is focused on more expensive upper middleclass buildings tenda is providing affordable houses this happens within the large public program minha casa minha vida my house my life alphaville is covering the product range between these two units the company as a whole is currently studying the possibility of separating the two genuine parts gafisa and tenda into two different and independent companies the share price of gfr is in steady decline for years now and has recently hit new lows with that overview in mind we will now discuss qualitative and quantitative issues in a first step we will briefly analyze the companys financial situation this will enable us to estimate how healthy and stable the company is a second step is the discussion of current or future issues of the company we aim to create a clearer picture of the company when we finally relate these two matters fundamentals let us have a look at the different financial dimensions of the business we will try to understand if a possible investment might be justified by underlying and reliable value income statement the latest annual report  stated a revenue of  million usd  billion brl net income before taxes reached  million usd  million brl which marks the first positive net income since  earnings per share amounted to   brl while the yearaverage only indicates   brl and the  yearaverage indicates  we should keep in mind that the company went through hard times in  and  at that time the gafisa was suffering from a massive drop in gross margins  in  this margin is now stable and slightly above  this is in the range of its  year average  we can use that as an indication that if gross margins stay constant in the future the average earnings per share will increase the data reported by the company for this years q and q suggest that gross margins are stabilizing however the numbers for the first two quarters look slightly weaker on a yearonyear basis the reasons for this development are found in the demanding market environment and will be discussed below after two troublesome years the company is within its former range of income levels even as general revenue seems to still be weak the company managed to cut costs and provide positive earnings per share based on the q results  appears to be slightly weaker than  this is also caused by additional but unique income in  which came from discontinued operations if we subtract this money  and  look pretty much equal on the income side cash flow last annual report stated a positive cash flow of  million usd  million brl this was the second year since  that the company managed to achieve an overall positive inflow of money one important factor is the lower positive cash flow for gfa in  compared to  this is caused by an unusually high amount of positive other financing activities in  another fact is the lower amount of sales of investments in  this is especially true in relation to the  purchases of these assets one must remind here that gafisa mainly buys land for project development while the constant repayment of debt is shrinking gafisas cash position the business has managed to contain a positive cash flow from its operations we think these two main factors drive gfas cash flow a the ratio of debt issued debt repaid we think it is important to notice that this ratio is in favor of the debt repaid since four years now this is a positive point since it means that the business is able to bring down its overall debt level b the profit made from investments mainly made in land there is little use to observe this in quarterly reports since it naturally takes time until purchased investment can be sold at a favourable price the annual reports state a useful approximation here they indicate that while the company keeps expanding its level of invested capital over the years it has lately failed to improve its sales of investment simultaneously yearonyear we think that this latest problem might be associated with overall difficulties in the market and we will discuss possible reasons below however as long as the company is able to reduce its debt load even under these unfavourable conditions we assume that this fluctuation should not be overvalued besides that we would appreciate an increased sales of investment compared to the purchase from year to year in the future this leads us to the underlying financial background of the company as it is presented in the balance sheet balance sheet as mentioned above the amount of cash at hand has decreased lately but as shortterm investments are also added to the overall cash position the company has increased its position by  since  and currently holds  million usd  billion brl of total cash the current assets amount to  billion usd  billion brl and are slightly below its  year average of  billion usd  billion brl latest data suggests that company is currently decreasing its assets through the repayment of debts and the reduction of other currents assets total assets were reported at  billion usd  billion brl this marks a  increase over the last five years but is still slightly below the average of the same timeframe   billion usd  billion brl on the side of the current liabilities we see a   increase of shortterm debt since   million usd at the same time the overall current liabilities have only increased   billion usd the shortterm debts should also be regarded as being slightly above the average of the same five years while current liabilities are quite below avg y shortterm debt  million usd avg y current liabilities  billion usd let us look at the non current liabilities now longterm debt of  million usd  billion brl rose only  since  this is below its average  million usd for the same time other longterm liabilities could also be reduced  during the last five years as a consequence total liabilities remain at the same level as five years ago and well below its  year average they amounted to  billion usd  billion brl for  gafisas latest quarterly reports underline the impression that the management is systematically reducing the size of the companys liabilities as mentioned before this is also paid with cash assets we know that shortterm financing is a indispensable tool for gafisas business but we think that a further improvement of the currentnon current liabilities towards the latter would be beneficial for the company and enable the company to reduce financing costs connecting the dots from what we see in the financial data we can conclude that gafisa is a stable business it went through a tough time during the last few years but seems to be in safer waters now we think it is clear that current earnings per share are historically high which might also be induced through the sale of assets in  alphaville therefore one should rather expect and base its further evaluation of the company on average past earnings than on the  eps alone if we apply the year average eps to the current price of around  we understand that the companys stock is now trading at  times historical average earnings this does neither indicate an uniquely cheap bargain nor a totally expensive stock but surely represents a low price in terms of industryaverage the pricetobook ratio reveals another aspect gfa is trading well below its book value it is remarkable that assets are so stable for the company and the management has successfully initiated the sustainable cut of liabilities this will reduce the companys financial leverage and allow it to operate more flexibly generally increasing cash at hand would be beneficial in this respect as this position is currently decreasing rapidly altogether gaifsa sa is a wellrun business that stands on stable financial grounds as related to its market price we think that the company is relatively cheap in relation to its main index it becomes clear that the company has significantly underperformed during the last five or six years with these points in mind let us try to understand why gafisa has performed so disappointingly for the last years and what investors can expect in the future qualitative issues macro situation a social housing the statefunded social housing program that started in  led to a large upward movement of gafisas stock price the program is continued until today and is an important part of tendas business however the market did only temporarily account for the large opportunities herein which are based on longterm political decisions b struggling economy during the last global economic crisis brazils economy suffered a lot its national economy has experienced serious headwinds and consumers are now worrying about increasing prices as pointed out by the company itself these rising uncertainties have a negative influence on the performance of the business many costumers tend to rethink their buyingdecision under the current economic circumstances c urbanization during the next decades more brazilians will move towards the large urban centers of the country this will provide a large opportunity for gafisa as these regions are already its core businessareas today d demographics brazil has a large cohort of young people now under  these people will need and demand decent housing in relation to their income all statistics suggest that with the improving educational standards and further development of the economy the middleclass income households will keep increasing for the next decade gafisa as the strong subsidiary of gafisa sa is a renowned brand for providing houses for this middleclass population furthermore the gafisa branch is a very profitable part of the overall business the two companies as mentioned before the management aims to split the company into its two main branches gafisa and tenda until today there are no details available about such a step in the future the uncertainty about this matter might be a bearish factor in todays market apart from that we do not have any evidence that such a procedure could happen without the participation of the shareholders without further details about possible scenarios and results for the shareholders we think that longterm investments seem to be too risky here this does not mean that the company in general is not trustworthy it simply implies to evaluate all news with great care conclusion we think the outlook for gafisa is only blared by the companys homemade problems there is no doubt that there is a constant and growing need for decent housing in brazils urban areas demographics indicate a growing market for the next  years we are skeptical about the companys plan to separate its two main branches completely the profitable gafisa branch would most likely benefit from such a move if this matter is closed we see positive macroindicators for gfas longterm business summary we presented gafisa sa and its fundamental financials we concluded that the company is despite recent macroeconomic headwinds financially stable and managed well the general environment is beneficial for the business in the longrun the unclear future of its branches makes the company an unattractive investment there is currently no reliable information on the issue available if this problem is settled and current price levels or lower are seen we would consider the company a bargain opportunity its stable asset structure and low pe and pb ratios make the company worth watching disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours the

of the corporate veil against cimob companhia imobiliária to reach for and pawn goods from gafisa sa for signs of fraud in an attempt to defraud their creditors the net assets of cimob had been reduced with the incorporation of gafisa sa gafisa sa lacks with transparency in their annual financial statement  on page  when they state that the company is included as successor in enforcement actions and in which the original debtor is a former shareholder of gafisa cimob companhia imobiliária “cimob””  and “cannot be held liable for the debt of a company that does not have any relationship with gafisa the final decision of the companys appeal however cannot be predicted at this time the lack of transparency now pointed in the annual financial statement  is verifiable by examining the decision from the supreme court with regards to the special appeal  which can no longer be appealed against it confirmed prior decision from the são paulo court according to which by the facts exposed there is a very strong business relationship involving the appealing company gafisa sa and the other firms withheld in the present legal case which evidence that gafisa sa was in fact

original court they may not be reviewed by that court according to the prohibition imposed by precedent  and  of that court on the other hand the same supreme court has expressly consented to the inclusion of gafisa sa in the national register of defaulters this is due to the existence of legal proceedings against them in the enforcement phase this judgment has acquired the authority of a
