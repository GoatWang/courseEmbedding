tobacco is a wellknown cancercausing agent and is also an environmental pollutant ecigarettes do not use tobacco to produce a smokelike vapour instead these devices heat an eliquid largely composed of water glycol and flavouring to create clouds of smoke nicotine an addictive agent present in tobacco cigarettes is sometimes added in varying liquid concentrations ecigarettes are not known to cause
