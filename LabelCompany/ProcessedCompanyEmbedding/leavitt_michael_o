williams senior circuit judge  securing fda approval for a generic drug is generally a much simpler and faster process than securing approval for a pioneer drug instead of directly demonstrating the drugs safety and efficacy see  usc § a manufacturers of the generic file an abbreviated new drug application anda that need show only that the generic is the same as the pioneer drug along certain dimensions see § jaiviii this case concerns fdas decision to change the dosage forms labeling and established names associated with appellant novartiss pioneer drug in ways that would ease the path for competing generic drugs novartis raises a number of procedural and substantive challenges to fdas changes the district court rejected all and we affirm         the fastest route to fda approval requires an anda to demonstrate not only that a generic drug has the same active ingredients as the pioneer drug and is bioequivalent to it ie roughly speaking is absorbed at the same rate and to the same extent when administered under similar conditions but also that the generic and pioneer drugs have the same dosage form and labeling  usc § jaiiv the latter two requirements are at issue in this case  dosage forms are categories that relate to such matters as a drugs appearance physical form and method of administration the fda assigns each drug a dosage form currently there are  such categories see fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations appx c th ed some of the dosage forms are quite broad for example elixir or tablet chewable while others are relatively narrow for example injectable lipid complex id if a generic manufacturer cannot show that its drug has the same dosage form as the pioneer drug it can still obtain fda approval but the process is more arduous the manufacturer may use an abbreviated application only if it first files a suitability petition and the fda grants it permission to file an anda  usc § jc  cfr §  even if the drug is ultimately approved the difference in dosage form will preclude the generic from being designated therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer drug and will thus disqualify the generic from being considered automatically substitutable for the pioneer drug under various state pharmacy laws see warnerlambert v shalala  fd   dccir  to avoid charges of misbranding the labels of prescription drugs must include certain pieces of information displayed in a particular way see  usc §  thus the requirement that a generic have the same labeling as the pioneer drug incorporates several additional requirements two of which are relevant to this case first fda requires the labels to contain the pioneer drugs dosage form see  cfr § aii so the samelabel requirement reincorporates the requirement that the generic drug share the pioneer drugs dosage form second the fda requires prescription drug labels to include the drugs established name see  cfr § ai which is a nonproprietary name assigned to the drug by the fda the rule mandating inclusion of the established nonproprietary name on the label means that a generic drug must have the same nonproprietary name as the pioneer drug for the fda to approve the generic drug through the anda process we turn later to the statutory framework for assigning such names  novartis markets cyclosporine drug products that are widely prescribed to prevent organ rejection in kidney liver and heart transplants these drugs were developed by novartiss predecessor sandoz corp for simplicity we refer to both corporations as novartis it markets two types of cyclosporine drugs under the proprietary names sandimmune and neoral both are available as capsules and as solutions and both form emulsions when they come into contact with aqueous liquids the difference is the size of the droplets in which the active ingredient is dispersed sandimmune forms a macroemulsion and disperses cyclosporine in larger droplets than does neoral which forms a microemulsion the smaller size of the droplets in the microemulsion allows neorals active ingredient—cyclosporine—to be absorbed more quickly and efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract see fda docket no p response to petition filed by novartis pharmaceuticals corp at  nov   petition response this difference means that the sandimmune and neoral products are not bioequivalent ie they are bioinequivalent and that a physicians decision to switch a patient from one to the other may require a different prescription  to highlight the differences between sandimmune and neoral the fda initially incorporated the term microemulsion into both neorals established name and its dosage form when the fda approved the neoral products in  it assigned them the established names cyclosporine oral solution for microemulsion and cyclosporine capsules for microemulsion petition response at  see also joint appendix  shortly thereafter the fda created two new dosage forms and assigned them to the neoral products capsule microemulsion and solution microemulsion  at a symposium in december  a leading transplant physician made a presentation about the development of a generic version of neoral that formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion alarmed novartis filed a citizen petition in march  requesting that the fda not approve any generic with a dosage form that was not identical to neorals or at least that it require an applicant seeking approval of such a drug to first file a suitability petition novartis had previously filed another citizen petition which the fda denied in the same response as it denied the march  petition novartis hasnt appealed denial of the first petition in principle the petition was simply a request that the fda obey the law though it could be taken as implicitly urging the fda not to delete microemulsion from the dosage forms assigned to the neoral products in fact the fda did just what novartis sought to avoid  responding to the petition in november  the fda announced that it would eliminate the microemulsion dosage forms altogether it explained that it had determined that neorals ability to form a microemulsion was not a function of dosage form rather than being an aspect of the physical recognition appearance dosing and manner of administration the microemulsionforming feature of neoral appeared only after the patient swallowed the product or in the case of the oral solution mixed it with another beverage to make it more palatable and was therefore a characteristic of the products formulation petition response at   n  there is no requirement that a generic drug have the same formulation as its pioneer moreover the fda said elimination of the microemulsion dosage form would serve its policy goal of encouraging the availability of generic products id at  finally it said that in light of its dosage form ruling it had reexamined the neoral products established names and determined that they should no longer refer to microemulsion the new established names would be simply cyclosporine capsules and cyclosporine oral solution these names would apply to sandimmune to neoral and to any approved generic versions of neoral that formed either microemulsions or microdispersions to communicate the differences between sandimmune on the one hand and neoral and generic equivalents that form either microemulsions or microdispersions on the other fda said it would now require the label for neoral and its generic equivalents to include the term modified petition response at  this term explained the fda is appropriate to alert physicians pharmacists and patients that neorals formulation presents a different bioavailability profile than the sandimmune formulation and is broad enough to encompass different bioequivalent formulations of cyclosporine eg a microemulsion or microdispersion and prominently displayed in bold type the term may become readily associated with the more bioavailable formulations of cyclosporine id  the fda issued this decision around the time that it approved an anda for sangcya a generic cyclosporine solution manufactured by sangstat medical corp sangstat had submitted data purporting to show that sangcya was bioequivalent to neoral sangcya differed from neoral in precisely the way that novartis had anticipated a generic competitor might it formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion had the neoral products dosage forms labeling and established names continued to refer to microemulsion sangstat would not have been able to secure fda approval for sangcya by directly filing an anda  a few months later in february  novartis filed suit in district court raising challenges to the fdas approval of the sangcya anda as well as to the fdas modifications to neorals dosage forms labeling and established names the district court found that the first of these challenges was moot while this litigation was before the district court new evidence came to light revealing that sangcya was not bioequivalent to neoral when properly administered with apple juice instead of with chocolate milk and the fda withdrew its approval of sangcya fda reports that as of the time it submitted its reply brief there were eight approved and not withdrawn generic equivalents for neoral half of which form microemulsions br for appellee  presumably the other half form microdispersions we affirm the district courts conclusion that the withdrawal mooted novartiss challenge to that approval for the reasons given by the district court mem op mar     on subsequent crossmotions for summary judgment the district court rejected the challenges to the fdas disposition of novartiss citizen petition mem op sept   we affirm the district courts rejection of each of novartiss substantive challenges to the fdas decisions regarding dosage forms labeling and established names of its neoral products because we have nothing to add to the district courts reasoning on these issues we do not address them here we do address below novartiss challenges to the completeness of the administrative record and to the procedures employed by the fda to change neorals dosage forms labeling and established names in each case we affirm the district court         the first objection that novartis raises on appeal is that the district court erred by failing to require production of the whole record as required by the administrative procedure act we review the district courts refusal to supplement the administrative record for abuse of discretion see james madison ltd v ludwig  fd   dccir  there are actually two administrative records at issue in this case the first is the public docket for novartiss citizen petition the second is the record of the fdas approval of the sangcya anda the district court initially referred the question of the records proper scope to a magistrate judge who refused novartiss requests to supplement the citizen petition record with records from a group of prior proceedings that novartis claimed were relevant finding that fda did not consider these records in addressing the citizen petition mem op jan    the magistrate judge did provide novartis with the sangcya anda approval record after withholding some tradesecret confidentialcommercial and otherwise privileged information id at  the district court affirmed the magistrate judges determinations mem op may    when the new evidence concerning sangcyas bioinequivalence became available novartis again sought to supplement the record the magistrate judge agreed with novartis in part expanding the record to include both the new bioinequivalence data and the hitherto withheld portions of sangcyas anda relating to its asserted bioequivalence mem op nov   in a subsequent decision the district court addressed both sangstats motion to dismiss novartiss challenge to the sangcya approval by then withdrawn as moot and sangstats separate motion to reconsider the magistrate judges determination regarding the scope of the record the district court found that novartiss attack on the sangcya approval was moot mem op mar    as noted above we affirm that decision for the reasons stated the district court then vacated the magistrate judges expansion of the record regarding its decision on substantive mootness as controlling that issue id at   on appeal novartis renews the supplementation requests denied by the district court in making its case novartis relies heavily on american bioscience inc v thompson  fd  dccir and walter o boswell memorial hosp v heckler  fd  dccir these cases do little to support novartiss position the agency failed to file any administrative record at all in the former case american bioscience inc  fd at  while in the latter neither party purported to have provided the court with the complete administrative record walter o boswell memorial hospital  fd at  we find no abuse of discretion in the district courts holding that the administrative record was complete and sufficient for judicial review we adopt its reasoning except with respect to novartiss efforts to include the data that originally purported to establish sangcyas bioequivalence to neoral rather than resting on the mootness of novartiss challenges to sangcyas approval we rely on the district courts later finding that novartis has pointed to nothing to support its claim that the fdas approval of sangcya tainted its consideration of the logically distinct issues raised by novartiss own citizen petition see mem op sept    novartis makes one other claim about the record but because it is closely related to novartiss procedural challenge to the fdas modifications of the neoral products established names we address it in the next section         novartis raises two procedural objections that apply to each of the fdas decisions regarding neorals dosage forms labeling and established names and a third procedural objection that applies only to the fdas modification of the established names for the two neoral products these challenges rely in varying proportions on interpretations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and regulations interpreting that statute we have held on a number of occasions that fda interpretations of the fdca receive deference as do its interpretations of its own regulations unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulations see eg purepac pharmaceutical co v thompson  fd   dccir mova pharmaceutical corp v shalala  fd   n  dccir  first novartis objects to the fdas failure to publicly docket any of sangstats requests that the fda modify the dosage forms labeling and established names that apply to novartiss neoral products saying that the fda violated its own procedures by not treating those requests as citizen petitions see  cfr §  the district court held that the provision permitting an interested person to petition the fda does not require fda to convert every letter or telephone call it receives in conjunction with an anda into a citizen petition mem op sept    and the district court pointed out another regulation forbids the fda from disclosing information about a pending anda unless its existence has previously been publicly disclosed id citing  cfr § bc we affirm  second novartis insists that the fda erred by failing to provide novartis with notice or opportunity to comment on its decisions the district court disagreed pointing out that novartiss own citizen petition gave it an opportunity to show in detail why it believed that the microemulsion dosage forms were appropriate mem op sept    we also note that novartis acknowledged the link between dosage form and labeling in that same petition and that the public docket indicates novartis took advantage of its opportunity to respond to comments made by others in response to its petition as novartis received ample notice and opportunity to be heard it has already received every benefit that it could from a favorable judgment on this issue better government assn v department of state  fd    n  dccir  third novartis makes a more specific argument that the fdas actions in modifying the neoral products established names were not procedurally proper our analysis of this argument is more complicated because novartis and the fda disagree on how to characterize the status of the nonproprietary names assigned to the neoral products when the fda approved them in  novartis argues that the fda designated official names pursuant to  usc § a this is significant novartis argues because it means that the fda may not modify those names without undertaking noticeandcomment rulemaking we conclude that novartis fails to establish either that the fda was required to proceed under §  or that as a discretionary matter it did proceed under that section in originally establishing nonproprietary names for the neoral products in   to evaluate novartiss arguments regarding the fdas initial assignment of nonproprietary names we begin by reviewing the statutory and regulatory framework governing established names there are two key statutory provisions the first is  usc § eai which provides that a drug may be subject to charges of misbranding unless its label bears among other things the established name as defined in subparagraph  of the drug if there is such a name subparagraph  provides that established name means  a the applicable official name designated pursuant to section  of this title or  b if there is no such name and such drug or such ingredient is an article recognized in an official compendium then the official title thereof in such compendium or  c if neither clause a nor clause b of this subparagraph applies then the common or usual name if any of such drug or of such ingredient with an exception that is not relevant here   usc § e neither party argues that clause c applies to the name given novartiss products in  and they affirmatively agree that clause b didnt apply to those designations see mem op sept    n  the official compendium referred to in clause b is the united states pharmacopoeia usp the applicable article or monograph titles in the usp omit the term microemulsion  reasoning by process of elimination novartis argues that with clauses b and c out of the picture the fdas  action must have been a designation under clause a of § e br for appellants  but this hardly appears to be the only reasonable reading of the statute for starters § eai refers to an established name if there is such a name suggesting that the categories of established names set out in § e do not exhaust the categories of nonproprietary names that the fda might assign  novartis tries to buttress its reading by asserting that § e defines the three name categories in descending order of preference br for appellants  novartis seems to have no basis for the claim every list puts some things lower than others but order is not necessarily an indication of rank also the fdas regulations take quite a different position providing that the fda will not routinely designate official names under section  of the act  usc §   cfr § e  the second key statutory provision is §  subsection a provides  the secretary may designate an official name for any drug or device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity any official name designated under this section for any drug or device shall be the only official name of that drug or device used in any official compendium published after such name has been prescribed or for any other purpose of this chapter   usc § a section b requires the secretary to undertake an apparently comprehensive review of the names by which drugs are identified in official compendia—ie in the usp section c provides that if after such a review the secretary determines that any names in the usp are problematic in any of several specified ways the secretary will initiate a noticeandcomment rulemaking to replace them with new names  novartiss argument that the fda in fact designated an official name pursuant to §  runs into trouble because the fdas  actions didnt align with the requirements of §  first there is no indication that the comprehensive review described in § b at least arguably a prerequisite to a §  designation ever occurred second as the district court pointed out § c requires the agency to designate the official names through noticeandcomment rulemaking which wasnt done in  novartis argues that the noticeandcomment requirement was satisfied because the fda designated names for novartiss neoral products at the conclusion of a formal process involving consultation with the usp nomenclature committee and rejection of the existing usp compendial name br for appellant  but it never explains why those procedures should be considered interchangeable with noticeandcomment rulemaking nor did the fda publicly indicate in some other way in  that it was designating an official name under §  third § a requires that once the fda designates an official name that name must be used in any official compendium but as explained above the usp nomenclature committee did not adopt the nonproprietary names that the fda assigned to neoral in  novartis disregards this statutory requirement accordingly there is no reason to believe such a designation occurred cf mem op sept     finally novartis contends that whether the fda assigned official names pursuant to §  is a factual question that cannot be answered without supplementing the administrative record with documentation of the fdas actions when it originally approved nonproprietary names for the neoral products we see no need for such an excavation given the gaps identified above there is no serious likelihood that extra documentation of the process by which the fda developed the nonproprietary names it initially assigned to the neoral would overturn our conclusion that the fda did not proceed under §   having rejected novartiss characterization of the fdas actions in  we examine the agencys explanation of the names it then assigned to the neoral products as interim established names the fda argues that the reference in § eai to a drugs established name if there is such a name means that it was not limited to the options set out in § e in designating a nonproprietary name it explains that it had filled that statutory gap by creating a fourth category of names for drug products interim established names recall that under § e a drug products established name could be the official monograph title for that product in the usp the usp nomenclature committee acts on its own schedule so that its designation of a name qualifying under § eb need not coincide with the fdas approval of a drug mem op sept    given the variable sequence the fdas designation of interim or provisional established names outside the § e triad appears both consistent with the statutory structure and reasonable  as the statute leaves space for fda designation of interim or provisional established names novartis has no basis for claiming that §  commands a noticeandcomment rulemaking for the change of such a name and novartis makes no claim that the apa itself commands use of that specific procedure in the absence of a §  designation insofar as novartis makes a general claim that fda acts arbitrarily and capriciously by not providing adequate notice and opportunity for comment before making any change of the neoral products interim names our earlier observation controls novartis had ample notice and opportunity to comment in its own citizen petition proceeding        the judgment of the district court is  affirmed notes  the samelabel requirement excepts differences required because the generic was approved under a suitability petition or because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or distributed by different manufacturers  usc § jav  cfr § aiv  the parties appear to assume that § eais labeling requirements encompass any nonproprietary name assigned to a drug by the fda even if the name does not qualify under § e we express no opinion on the issue michael o leavitt  mormonism the mormon church beliefs

circuit judge opinion for the court filed by senior circuit judge williams securing fda williams senior circuit judge approval for a generic drug is generally a much simpler and faster process than securing approval for a pioneer drug instead of directly demonstrating the drug s safety and efficacy see  usc § a manufacturers of the generic file an abbreviated new drug application  anda  that need show only that the generic is the same as the pioneer drug along certain dimensions see § jaiviii this case concerns fda s decision to change the dosage forms labeling and established names associated with appellant novartis s pioneer drug in ways that would ease the path for competing generic drugs novartis raises a number of procedural and substantive challenges to fda s changes the district court rejected all and we affirm    the fastest route to fda approval requires an anda to demonstrate not only that a generic drug has the same active ingredients as the pioneer drug and is bioequivalent to it ie roughly speaking is absorbed at the same rate and to the same extent when administered under similar conditions but also that the generic and pioneer drugs have the same dosage form and labeling  usc § jaiiv the latter two requirements are at issue in this case  dosage forms are categories that relate to such matters as a drug s appearance physical form and method of administration the fda assigns each drug a dosage form currently there are  such categories see fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations appx c th ed  some of the dosage forms are quite broad for example elixir or tablet chewable  while others are relatively narrow for example injectable lipid complex  id if a generic manufacturer cannot show that its drug has the same dosage form as the pioneer drug it can still obtain fda approval but the process is more arduous the manufacturer may use an abbreviated application only if it first files a suitability petition and the fda grants it permission to file an anda  usc § jc  cfr §  even if the drug is ultimately approved the difference in dosage form will preclude the generic from being designated therapeutically equivalent to the pioneer drug and will thus disqualify the generic from being considered automatically substitutable for the pioneer drug under various state pharmacy laws see warnerlambert v shalala  fd   dc cir  to avoid charges of misbranding the labels of prescription drugs must include certain pieces of information displayed in a particular way see  usc §  thus the requirement that a generic have the same labeling as the pioneer drug incorporates several additional requirements two of which are relevant to this case first fda requires the  the samelabel requirement excepts differences required because the generic was approved under a suitability petition or because the new drug and the listed drug are produced or  labels to contain the pioneer drug s dosage form see  cfr § aii so the samelabel requirement reincorporates the requirement that the generic drug share the pioneer drug s dosage form second the fda requires prescription drug labels to include the drug s established name see  cfr § ai which is a nonproprietary name assigned to the drug by the fda the rule mandating inclusion of the established nonproprietary name on the label means that a generic drug must have the same nonproprietary name as the pioneer drug for the fda to approve the generic drug through the anda process we turn later to the statutory framework for assigning such names novartis markets cyclosporine drug products that are widely prescribed to prevent organ rejection in kidney liver and heart transplants these drugs were developed by novartis s predecessor sandoz corp for simplicity we refer to both corporations as novartis it markets two types of cyclosporine drugs under the proprietary names sandimmune and neoral both are available as capsules and as solutions and both form emulsions when they come into contact with aqueous liquids the difference is the size of the droplets in which the active ingredient is dispersed sandimmune forms a macroemulsion and disperses cyclosporine in larger droplets than does neoral which forms a microemulsion the smaller size of the droplets in the microemulsion allows neoral s active ingredient cyclosporine to be absorbed more quickly and efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract see fda distributed by different manufacturers § jav  cfr § aiv  usc  docket no p response to petition filed by novartis pharmaceuticals corp at  nov    petition response  this difference means that the sandimmune and neoral products are not bioequivalent ie they are bioinequivalent and that a physician s decision to switch a patient from one to the other may require a different prescription to highlight the differences between sandimmune and neoral the fda initially incorporated the term microemulsion into both neoral s established name and its dosage form when the fda approved the neoral products in  it assigned them the established names cyclosporine oral solution for microemulsion and cyclosporine capsules for microemulsion petition response at  see also joint appendix  shortly thereafter the fda created two new dosage forms and assigned them to the neoral products capsule microemulsion and solution microemulsion at a symposium in december  a leading transplant physician made a presentation about the development of a generic version of neoral that formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion alarmed novartis filed a citizen petition in march  requesting that the fda not approve any generic with a dosage form that was not identical to neoral s or at least that it require an applicant seeking approval of such a drug to first file a suitability petition novartis had previously filed another citizen petition which the fda denied in the same response as it denied the march  petition novartis hasn t appealed denial of the first petition in principle the petition was simply a request that the fda obey the law though it could be taken as implicitly urging the fda not to delete microemulsion from the dosage forms assigned to the  neoral products sought to avoid in fact the fda did just what novartis responding to the petition in november  the fda announced that it would eliminate the microemulsion dosage forms altogether it explained that it had determined that neoral s ability to form a microemulsion was not a function of dosage form rather than being an aspect of the physical recognition appearance dosing and manner of administration the microemulsionforming feature of neoral appeared only after the patient swallowed the product or in the case of the oral solution mixed it with another beverage to make it more palatable and was therefore a characteristic of the product s formulation petition response at   n there is no requirement that a generic drug have the same formulation as its pioneer moreover the fda said elimination of the microemulsion dosage form would serve its policy goal of encouraging the availability of generic products id at  finally it said that in light of its dosage form ruling it had reexamined the neoral products established names and determined that they should no longer refer to microemulsion the new established names would be simply cyclosporine capsules and cyclosporine oral solution these names would apply to sandimmune to neoral and to any approved generic versions of neoral that formed either microemulsions or microdispersions to communicate the differences between sandimmune on the one hand and neoral and generic equivalents that form either microemulsions or microdispersions on the other fda said it would now require the label for neoral and its generic equivalents to include the term modified petition response at  this term explained the fda is appropriate to alert physicians pharmacists and patients that neoral s formulation presents a different bioavailability  profile than the sandimmune formulation and is broad enough to encompass different bioequivalent formulations of cyclosporine eg a microemulsion or microdispersion and prominently displayed in bold type the term may become readily associated with the more bioavailable formulations of cyclosporine id the fda issued this decision around the time that it approved an anda for sangcya a generic cyclosporine solution manufactured by sangstat medical corp sangstat had submitted data purporting to show that sangcya was bioequivalent to neoral sangcya differed from neoral in precisely the way that novartis had anticipated a generic competitor might it formed a microdispersion of solid particles instead of a microemulsion had the neoral products dosage forms labeling and established names continued to refer to microemulsion sangstat would not have been able to secure fda approval for sangcya by directly filing an anda a few months later in february  novartis filed suit in district court raising challenges to the fda s approval of the sangcya anda as well as to the fda s modifications to neoral s dosage forms labeling and established names the district court found that the first of these challenges was moot while this litigation was before the district court new evidence came to light revealing that sangcya was not bioequivalent to neoral when properly administered with apple juice instead of with chocolate milk and the fda withdrew its approval of sangcya fda reports that as of the time it submitted its reply brief there were eight approved and not withdrawn generic equivalents for neoral half of which form microemulsions br for appellee  presumably the other half form microdispersions we affirm  the district court s conclusion that the withdrawal mooted novartis s challenge to that approval for the reasons given by the district court mem op mar    on subsequent crossmotions for summary judgment the district court rejected the challenges to the fda s disposition of novartis s citizen petition mem op sept   we affirm the district court s rejection of each of novartis s substantive challenges to the fda s decisions regarding dosage forms labeling and established names of its neoral products because we have nothing to add to the district court s reasoning on these issues we do not address them here we do address below novartis s challenges to the completeness of the administrative record and to the procedures employed by the fda to change neoral s dosage forms labeling and established names in each case we affirm the district court    the first objection that novartis raises on appeal is that the district court erred by failing to require production of the whole record as required by the administrative procedure act we review the district court s refusal to supplement the administrative record for abuse of discretion see james madison ltd v ludwig  fd   dc cir  there are actually two administrative records at issue in this case the first is the public docket for novartis s citizen petition the second is the record of the fda s approval of the sangcya anda the district court initially referred the question of the records proper scope to a magistrate judge who refused novartis s requests to supplement the citizen petition record with records from a group of prior proceedings  that novartis claimed were relevant finding that fda did not consider these records in addressing the citizen petition mem op jan    the magistrate judge did provide novartis with the sangcya anda approval record after withholding some tradesecret confidentialcommercial and otherwise privileged information id at  the district court affirmed the magistrate judge s determinations mem op may   when the new evidence concerning sangcya s bioinequivalence became available novartis again sought to supplement the record the magistrate judge agreed with novartis in part expanding the record to include both the new bioinequivalence data and the hitherto withheld portions of sangcya s anda relating to its asserted bioequivalence mem op nov   in a subsequent decision the district court addressed both sangstat s motion to dismiss novartis s challenge to the sangcya approval by then withdrawn as moot and sangstat s separate motion to reconsider the magistrate judge s determination regarding the scope of the record the district court found that novartis s attack on the sangcya approval was moot mem op mar    as noted above we affirm that decision for the reasons stated the district court then vacated the magistrate judge s expansion of the record regarding its decision on substantive mootness as controlling that issue id at  on appeal novartis renews the supplementation requests denied by the district court in making its case novartis relies heavily on american bioscience inc v thompson  fd  dc cir  and walter o boswell memorial hosp v heckler  fd  dc cir  these cases do little to support novartis s position the agency failed to file any administrative record at all in the former case american  bioscience inc  fd at  while in the latter neither party purported to have provided the court with the complete administrative record walter o boswell memorial hospital  fd at  we find no abuse of discretion in the district court s holding that the administrative record was complete and sufficient for judicial review we adopt its reasoning except with respect to novartis s efforts to include the data that originally purported to establish sangcya s bioequivalence to neoral rather than resting on the mootness of novartis s challenges to sangcya s approval we rely on the district court s later finding that novartis has pointed to nothing to support its claim that the fda s approval of sangcya tainted its consideration of the logically distinct issues raised by novartis s own citizen petition see mem op sept    novartis makes one other claim about the record but because it is closely related to novartis s procedural challenge to the fda s modifications of the neoral products established names we address it in the next section    novartis raises two procedural objections that apply to each of the fda s decisions regarding neoral s dosage forms labeling and established names and a third procedural objection that applies only to the fda s modification of the established names for the two neoral products these challenges rely in varying proportions on interpretations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act  fdca  and regulations interpreting that statute we have held on a number of occasions that fda interpretations of the fdca receive deference as do its interpretations of its own regulations unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the  regulations see eg purepac pharmaceutical co v thompson  fd   dc cir  mova pharmaceutical corp v shalala  fd   n dc cir  first novartis objects to the fda s failure to publicly docket any of sangstat s requests that the fda modify the dosage forms labeling and established names that apply to novartis s neoral products saying that the fda violated its own procedures by not treating those requests as citizen petitions see  cfr §  the district court held that the provision permitting an interested person to petition the fda does not require fda to convert every letter or telephone call it receives in conjunction with an anda into a citizen petition mem op sept    and the district court pointed out another regulation forbids the fda from disclosing information about a pending anda unless its existence has previously been publicly disclosed id citing  cfr § bc we affirm second novartis insists that the fda erred by failing to provide novartis with notice or opportunity to comment on its decisions the district court disagreed pointing out that novartis s own citizen petition gave it an opportunity to show in detail why it believed that the microemulsion dosage forms were appropriate mem op sept    we also note that novartis acknowledged the link between dosage form and labeling in that same petition and that the public docket indicates novartis took advantage of its opportunity to respond to comments made by others in response to its petition as novartis received ample notice and opportunity to be heard it has already received every benefit that it could from a favorable judgment on this issue better government  ass n v department of state  fd    n dc cir  third novartis makes a more specific argument that the fda s actions in modifying the neoral products established names were not procedurally proper our analysis of this argument is more complicated because novartis and the fda disagree on how to characterize the status of the nonproprietary names assigned to the neoral products when the fda approved them in  novartis argues that the fda designated official names pursuant to  usc § a this is significant novartis argues because it means that the fda may not modify those names without undertaking noticeandcomment rulemaking we conclude that novartis fails to establish either that the fda was required to proceed under §  or that as a discretionary matter it did proceed under that section in originally establishing nonproprietary names for the neoral products in  to evaluate novartis s arguments regarding the fda s initial assignment of nonproprietary names we begin by reviewing the statutory and regulatory framework governing established names there are two key statutory provisions the first is  usc § eai which provides that a drug may be subject to charges of misbranding unless its label bears among other things the established name as defined in subparagraph  of the drug if there is such a name subparagraph  provides that established name means a the applicable official name designated pursuant to section  of this title or  b if there is no such name and such drug or such ingredient is an article recognized in an official compendium then the official title thereof in such compendium or c if neither clause a nor clause b of this subparagraph applies then the common or usual name if any of such drug or of such ingredient with an exception that is not relevant here  usc § e neither party argues that clause c applies to the name given novartis s products in  and they affirmatively agree that clause b didn t apply to those designations see mem op sept    n the official compendium referred to in clause b is the united states pharmacopoeia  usp  the applicable article or monograph titles in the usp omit the term microemulsion reasoning by process of elimination novartis argues that with clauses b and c out of the picture the fda s  action must have been a designation under clause a of § e br for appellants  but this hardly appears to be the only reasonable reading of the statute for starters § eai refers to an established name if there is such a name suggesting that the categories of established names set out in § e do not exhaust the categories of nonproprietary names that the fda might assign  the parties appear to assume that § eai s labeling requirements encompass any nonproprietary name assigned to a drug by the fda even if the name does not qualify under § e we express no opinion on the issue  novartis tries to buttress its reading by asserting that § e defines the three name categories in descending order of preference br for appellants  novartis seems to have no basis for the claim every list puts some things lower than others but order is not necessarily an indication of rank also the fda s regulations take quite a different position providing that the fda will not routinely designate official names under section  of the act  usc §      cfr § e the second key statutory provision is §  subsection a provides the secretary may designate an official name for any drug or device if he determines that such action is necessary or desirable in the interest of usefulness and simplicity any official name designated under this section for any drug or device shall be the only official name of that drug or device used in any official compendium published after such name has been prescribed or for any other purpose of this chapter  usc § a section b requires the secretary to undertake an apparently comprehensive review of the names by which drugs are identified in official compendia ie in the usp section c provides that if after such a review the secretary determines that any names in the usp are problematic in any of several specified ways the secretary will initiate a noticeandcomment rulemaking to replace them with new names novartis s argument that the fda in fact designated an official name pursuant to §  runs into trouble because the fda s  actions didn t align with the requirements of  §  first there is no indication that the comprehensive review described in § b at least arguably a prerequisite to a §  designation ever occurred second as the district court pointed out § c requires the agency to designate the official names through noticeandcomment rulemaking which wasn t done in  novartis argues that the noticeandcomment requirement was satisfied because the fda designated names for novartis s neoral products at the conclusion of a formal process involving consultation with the usp nomenclature committee and rejection of the existing usp compendial name br for appellant  but it never explains why those procedures should be considered interchangeable with noticeandcomment rulemaking nor did the fda publicly indicate in some other way in  that it was designating an official name under §  third § a requires that once the fda designates an official name that name must be used in any official compendium but as explained above the usp nomenclature committee did not adopt the nonproprietary names that the fda assigned to neoral in  novartis disregards this statutory requirement accordingly there is no reason to believe such a designation occurred cf mem op sept    finally novartis contends that whether the fda assigned official names pursuant to §  is a factual question that cannot be answered without supplementing the administrative record with documentation of the fda s actions when it originally approved nonproprietary names for the neoral products we see no need for such an excavation given the gaps identified above there is no serious likelihood that extra documentation of the process by which the fda developed the nonproprietary names it initially assigned to the neoral would overturn our conclusion that the fda did not proceed under §   having rejected novartis s characterization of the fda s actions in  we examine the agency s explanation of the names it then assigned to the neoral products as interim established names the fda argues that the reference in § eai to a drug s established name if there is such a name means that it was not limited to the options set out in § e in designating a nonproprietary name it explains that it had filled that statutory gap by creating a fourth category of names for drug products interim established names recall that under § e a drug product s established name could be the official monograph title for that product in the usp the usp nomenclature committee acts on its own schedule so that its designation of a name qualifying under § eb need not coincide with the fda s approval of a drug mem op sept    given the variable sequence the fda s designation of interim or provisional established names outside the § e triad appears both consistent with the statutory structure and reasonable as the statute leaves space for fda designation of interim or provisional established names novartis has no basis for claiming that §  commands a noticeandcomment rulemaking for the change of such a name and novartis makes no claim that the apa itself commands use of that specific procedure in the absence of a §  designation insofar as novartis makes a general claim that fda acts arbitrarily and capriciously by not providing adequate notice and opportunity for comment before making any change of the neoral products interim names our earlier observation controls novartis had ample notice and opportunity to comment in its own citizen petition proceeding
