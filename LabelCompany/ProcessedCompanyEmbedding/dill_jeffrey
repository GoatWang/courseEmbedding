for months now but as it turns out starting a company is very timeconsuming who knew and most days haven’t left me with enough brainjuice to feel up to the task of writing about it while also building it but fortunately our workload is becoming a little more manageable and i’ve now been able to settle into enough of a rhythm that i finally feel capable of transferring some of the content in my head to the screen what i’m really excited about doing is deepdiving some of the biggest things i’ve learned so far sharing details about how we work etc but first i’ll simply introduce the company laying

henry ford has so many memorable quotes but this one is definitely my favorite i was reminded of it earlier today by eric dodds posing an oftwondered question  “is the customer always right” it’s an important thing to consider for any company as the answer to this question will greatly influence how products ideas marketing strategies etc are imagined and developed how much stock should you put into input from your user base how much should you trust your own instincts and experience in your respective field what happens when these two approaches conflict to many people the answer would seem obvious and likely something along the lines of of course the customer is always right if the customer isn’t happy then you don’t have a business while i would completely agree with the obviousness of

finally got a chance to give the new macbook a whirl and decided to share my thoughts about it i very rarely feel compelled to review products or services like the average consumer i typically only review things when they’re so fantastic that i think they’re a real gamechanger or conversely when they’re so terrible that i think it’s very likely they’ll be a gameender unfortunately this review will be the latter  let’s begin the big question admittedly i was skeptical about the new macbook from the getgo despite my skepticism i really do like to give everything a fair chance so i tried to keep as open of a mind as possible rather than focusing on any specific feature of the macbook and making an uninformed decision about whether or not i would like it i instead simply pondered the question “who is this designed for” unfortunately after spending some time with it in person i’m no closer to answering that question and that really is the big question  the only on… share get link
