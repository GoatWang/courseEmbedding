leadership hats or to alter the way you assess a business problem under pressure most executives fall back on the management style or approach that worked in the last crisis they faced but old approaches rarely work in new and demanding situations just ask leonard schaeffer chairman and ceo of wellpoint health networks one of the countrys largest and most successful managedcare companies in this account he describes how he consciously adopted three very different styles of leadership at critical points during his year career depending on the business challenges at hand schaeffer headed up the us health care finance administration during the carter yearsand led the charge toward more efficient work practices at that agency then he transformed blue cross of california from a floundering bureaucracy losing close to  million each day into a strong public company wellpoint the dire circumstances at blue cross had dictated that schaeffer initially be an autocratic leader which he considers the managerial equivalent of being an emergency room surgeonforced to do whatever it takes to save a patients life most recently schaeffer has turned into a reformera leader who works with one foot outside the company to spur changes in health care and society there are pitfalls in switching leadership styles schaeffer admits but this flexibility is necessary for realizing

 getty images warren buffett was at his oracular best during the recent berkshire hathaway annual meeting where he took on american business leaders’ desire for tax cutsbusinesses are wrong to blame taxes for strangling american competitiveness he said the real culprit is healthcare costscorporate taxes as a percentage of gross domestic product have actually gone down over the past  years and now hover at about  percentmeanwhile the american healthcare system consumes nearly  percent of gdp up from  percent in  buffett’s main point was that healthcare costs are the bigger threat to business a kaiser family foundation study for example found that corporations now spend  on average for insurance for a family of four up  percent since    advertisementbut the danger goes much further healthcare costs are a threat to the entire economy not just to business left to current market forces those costs will result in higher government deficits increased borrowing and eventually higher taxes on everyone both personal and corporate by  the government projects healthcare will consume onequarter of the economy the connection between healthcare spending and the national deficit is rarely made in congressional debate that is not a good thing healthcare costs are rapidly overwhelming both state and federal budgets while raising costs for businesses that provide health insurance to their employees as former congressional budget office head alice rivlin puts it “longrun fiscal policy is health policy” what can we do to control these costsfirst recognize that we are not getting what we think we are paying for spending more on healthcare does not mean better health the rand health insurance experiment for example found that families provided with free care spent nearly  percent more on medical care than those in highdeductible plans but did not experience any measurable differences in average population health the dartmouth atlas tells a similar story in medicare regions that spend more on treatment do not have better outcomesevidence shows that the us healthcare system is laden with fat and overpays for care much of which is unnecessary and not evidencebased according to health affairs multiple studies have concluded that  percent or more of us health spending is wasteful despite widely outspending other developed countries we have poorer outcomes including higher infant mortality greater prevalence of chronic conditions and shorter lifespans  second accelerate a shift in focus from treatment to prevention we know that it is cheaper to reduce high cholesterol than to repair a body after a heart attack similarly we know that public health programs to reduce smoking and deliver clean water and food dramatically cut disease rates much of the money that flows to expanding hospital facilities would be better spent on social or other communitybased services that sustain health rather than restore it third providers insurers and drug manufacturers need to rein in costs by redesigning how we deliver and pay for healthcare by changing how where and by whom preventive and curative care is delivered and by ensuring that evidencebased care is provided we can get better care better outcomes and lower costs if this is not done political pressure for a single payer plan will increase buffett for one likes the idea even if single payer is ruled out failure to control costs will likely lead to onerous new regulations throughout the healthcare sector when we reach a point where the accumulated debt threatens the economy and ultimately our national security federal and state health policy will become even more draconian a fiscal crisis could lead to blunt cuts in healthcare funding if the system has not been redesigned however we will simply be buying less from the same poorly performing health care delivery system buffett put it succinctly “medical costs are the tapeworm of american economic competitiveness” he said it’s time to extract the tapeworm and give americans an affordable and sustainable healthcare system that will not eat them from the inside out leonard d schaeffer is the founding chairman and former chief
