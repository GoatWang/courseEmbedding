developments neurotrope inc presents clinical results from phase  trial demonstrating that moderatetosevere alzheimers disease patients treated with  µg bryostatin jul   neurotrope inc presented clinical results from its recently completed phase  trial demonstrating that moderatetosevere alzheimers disease patients treated with  µg bryostatin showed preliminary evidence of sustained improvement in cognition compared to placebo the week randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study evaluated the safety tolerability and efficacy of bryostatin in  moderatetosevere ad patients across three treatment arms  µg  µg placebo this is the first placebocontrolled ad trial of a protein kinase c epsilon pkc activator which in preclinical studies induced the growth of new synapses and prevented neuronal death this represents a new therapeutic strategy for ad that directly addresses the emerging consensus that synaptic loss has a major impact on cognitive deficits of ad the improvements in the primary cognitive endpoint the severe impairment battery sib were observed in the studys  µg treatment arm as early as week five and were maintained throughout the week study table the scores for the secondary functional endpoint the adcsadlsiv alzheimers disease cooperative study activities of daily living inventory severe impairment version for the  µg treatment arm showed improvement at week  unlike the  µg dose there was no therapeutic signal observed with the  µg dose this contrast between the signal observed with the  µg dose versus the  µg dose was reinforced by the results of a cohens d analysis part of an indepth statistical evaluation of the study data that found a consistent signal of benefit in sib and adcsadlsiv for the  µg dose at the end of the trial patients dosed with  µg had a dropout rate similar to placebo while patients dosed at  µg experienced poorer safety and tolerability and had a higher dropout rate treatment emergent adverse events teaes were mostly mild or moderate in severity teaes including serious adverse events were more common in the  µg group as compared to the  µg and placebo groups these data reinforce the safety and tolerability of the  µg dose the lack of signal at the higher  µg dose is not entirely unexpected based on the in vitro dose response features of bryostatininduced pkc activation as seen with the  µg dose the obligatory downregulation phase appears to override the initial activation phase thereby mitigating the desired clinical effect khang khang llp announces securities class action lawsuit against neurotrope inc jul   khang khang llp announced a securities class action lawsuit against neurotrope inc investors who purchased or otherwise acquired neurotrope shares from january   through

statements andor failed to disclose material adverse information about the efficacy of its lead product candidate bryostatin on may   the company announced positive topline results for the focal phase b trials of bryostatin mentioning improvement in patients with moderate to severe alzheimers disease the trial data refutes these statements however as the topline data relating to the microgram dose of bryostatin did not produce statistically significant results neurotrope also allegedly failed to disclose statements about the efficacy of the microgram dose in connection with its primary and
