the emergence of cloud computing we believe cloud computing is the most important trend in the software industry of the decade we have been fortunate to work with many of the early pioneers in this high growth market segment and continue to invest actively to grow our current portfolio we define cloud computing as the umbrella encompassing softwareasaservice saas platformsasaservice paas and infrastructureasaservice iaas historically we have been very active in the saas space and will continue to do so  however as cloud computing has expanded beyond just providing applications as a service so has our practice consumer with a history that includes early investments in yelp linkedin and skype bessemer has earned a reputation for spotting fledging stars in the notably hard to predict world of consumer tech our current portfolio includes pinterest largest shareholder with investment dating back to the  series a blue apron seeded the company and the largest institutional

please get in touch cyber security at bessemer venture partners we believe that our long history and successful track record in cyber security provide us a key advantage in identifying and assisting the most important security startups – our investors have been involved in starting or funding over forty cyber security companies over the last two decades including eight ipos and  large acquisitions developer platforms in today’s programmable world developers embody many archetypes they are the creators that build our software the heroes that solve real issues the outlaws and jesters testing the limitations of cyber security as a result developers are now the kingmakers at large organizations empowered to make major purchasing decisions and deploy big budgets a new ecosystem of bd companies that bypasses traditional enterprise it and sells directly to developers via the cloud has emerged to enable their full power and creativity financial services bvp has a long history of

innovation bvps investment advisory team combines local knowledge and technical expertise with a global platform to help guide portfolio copmaines to global success since  bvp has invested in  companies and established a person mumbaibased advisory team industry software industryspecific cloud software companies don’t get as much attention as their horizontal brethren like salesforce or workday why it’s been assumed that the markets they serve are simply too small and sleepy we think that’s misguided while companies like guidewire athenahealth dealertrack veeva demandware and realpage don’t get much fanfare in the press they are solving real problems in each of their industries and they have quietly grown to become multibilliondollar publiclytraded companies this is just the beginning we’re convinced that many more industries—from banking to mining to agriculture—will be transformed by ditching their legacy vendors and migrating to the cloud infrastructure  bessemer has been investing in industryleading it infrastructure companies for close to forty years yet we have never been more excited about the potential for innovation in this arena  several key technology trends and market developments promise to transform the industry again in the coming decade creating the opportunity for a new set of industry leaders to emerge  israel opportunities bvp has been investing in israel since  and opened an office in herzliya in  the partners consider companies at many stages from seed to growth and across a number of sectors  software internet semiconductors storage communications and cleantech marketplaces as investors we believe that the best business model ever conceived could be the marketplace model  because marketplaces benefit from powerful network effects – supply and demand follow each other – it’s often a highstakes battle for leadership when one marketplace achieves undisputed leadership it can generate huge profits retain customers and keep competitors at bay we admire this winnertakeall or occasionally winnertakemost dynamic and are actively evaluating marketplace investments mobile bessemer’s history in communications spans more than three decades dating back to companies like ungermannbass which pioneered local area networking the term “lan” was actually coined in the living room of bvp’s neill brownstein  our investments have followed the rapid evolution of the communications landscape with many of our recent investments focused on the mobile space around the themes of mobile device penetration the consumer experiences they enable and the challenges these devices bring to operators space tech throughout history the exploration of new frontiers has yielded economic bounties in the forms of resources living space
