at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to mr steve douglas vice president investor relations mr douglas please go ahead stephen douglas  suncor energy inc thank you michelle and good morning to everyone welcome to the suncor energy second quarter earnings call with me here in calgary this morning are steve williams our president and ceo along with alister cowan our evp and chief financial officer id ask you to note that todays comments contain forwardlooking information that our actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions described in our second quarter earnings release as well as our current aif and both of these are available on sedar edgar and our website suncorcom certain financial measures that we refer to in these comments are not prescribed by canadian gaap for description of these financial measures again see our second quarter earnings release following our formal remarks we will open the call to questions first from members of the investment community and then if time permits members of the media with that ill ask steve williams for his comments steven w williams  suncor energy inc thanks steve and good morning and thank you to everyone on the line for joining us i think its important right up front to acknowledge that our second quarter results were somewhat mixed both from an operational and a business environment perspective the past few months of  the combination of falling crude price and a strengthening canadian dollar and these trends and continued volatility i think simply underline the importance of concentrating our efforts on those things which we can control in suncors cash that means a continued focus on disciplined cost management and of course capital allocation and those two add up to what we call operational excellence on the positive side im very pleased with our continued success in taking cost out of the business were steadily moving the entire company towards a sustainably lower cost base thats positioning us to be globally competitive at the same time we continue to exercise capital discipline while executing on our growth programs buying back shares and maintaining a strong balance sheet our downstream and offshore business delivered strong operational and financial results however as i said im not satisfied with the operational performance of our oil sands assets in the second quarter the first major maintenance turnaround at firebag units three and four after five years of operation encountered a number of challenges resulted in a significantly slower restart and rampup than expected and at syncrude the planned april turnaround was advanced use of fire and a plight wreck  in march and then had to be extended as a result of repairs associated with the fire as well as several other more minor operational issues syncrude also advanced coker maintenance originally planned for this fall in order to take advantage of the downtime so the end result was lower oil sands production than we had planned for in the quarter however its worth saying that i am confident that the earnings from these events will assist us in better understanding these assets going forward and we are planning for a return to strong reliable production throughout the second half of the year its important to note that even in the quarter where our oil sands production fell short of plan and average oil prices were below expectations suncor still generated funds from operations of over cad  billion and this just demonstrates once again what a powerful cash generation gene  the suncor integrated model is so lets get into the details of our second quarter at oil sands we produced a total of just over  barrels a day including  barrels a day of upgraded product we completed major plant maintenance activities at firebag and the unit  upgrader and held our cash cost to just cad  per barrel and thats the lowest second quarter oil sands cash costs in over a decade with the bulk of our oil sands maintenance for the year now complete our oil sands operations have been running at full rates in july we expect our production guidance for the – we expect to meet our production guidance for the year and have actually lowered our cash cost guidance to cad  to cad  per barrel thanks to our strong yeartodate performance at syncrude planned and unplanned outages reduced suncor share of production by over  barrels a day in the quarter and once again this performance is not acceptable i remain confident that we can achieve the longterm operational goals we have set we always knew that the road to operational excellence would not be a straight line and that there will be some setbacks like what we experienced in the quarter however we will continue to work closely with syncrude and other owners to execute on a plan that expect will drive utilization rates above  and cash cost below  – below us per barrel by  so those are original commitments were confident in in ep we continue to see excellent performance in the second quarter our total offshore production yeartodate is tracking  ahead of last year at the same time cash operating costs have come down to  with average operating costs yeartodate on the east coast below cad  per barrel and in the north sea well below cad  per barrel and remember of course those are canadian dollars so as a result of this strong performance weve raised our  production guidance for ep twice this year by a total of  barrels per day in the downstream our refining and marketing business turned in another excellent quarter utilization rates our refineries rose to  which drove a  increase in production and a  drop in unit operating expense versus q of last year the increased production supported strong retail sales and set a suncor record for the first half of the year so despite market concerns around gasoline demand our downstream business is squarely on track to deliver another year of strong earnings and cash flows turning to our growth projects its an exciting time at fort hills and hebron as they rapidly approach first oil our focus is increasingly on commissioning startup and operations as we move into the last few months of construction at fort hills weve been tracking to the previously announced budget and schedule the mining ore operation major site infrastructure and primary extraction assets have all been handed over to operations and the turnover of utilities is now in progress just two weeks ago the east tank farm which will support the fort hills operation was commissioned and declared ready for service that just leaves a secondary extraction the paraffinic froth treatment as the final area where construction activities are currently concentrated we recently identified some opportunities to accelerate the construction schedule in order to take best advantage of productivity and further derisk the full plant startup this would result in some capital spending originally scheduled for  being brought into  and accordingly youll have noted we have adjusted our guidance and alister will go into the details a bit later on the call now remember that were proceeding with phase commissioning and startup plan that will see the frontend of the plant including the water assets fully tested prior to the onset of cold winter weather this allows for early identification and resolution of any issues that may arise and as a result we expect to significantly derisk the production of first oil late in  approximately  of personnel have been hired – of operating personnel have been hired including all critical frontline positions training activities are well advanced and we have greatly benefited from attracting experienced staff in the pft process there has been one recent development on the fort hills project that is a little disappointing our partner total has chosen not to approve or provide additional project sanction funding for the fort hills project and as a result we are now in the early stages of a commercial dispute with total given the fact that construction is now  as of the end of july were not anticipating that this issue will impact the plan to achieve first oil by the end of the year our major growth – our other major growth project is of course hebron off the east coast of canada during the second quarter the hebron platform was successfully towed back to its offshore location and safely positioned on the sea floor drilling operations commenced just last week and the project remains well on track to produce first oil by the end of this year as planned so with all operations back up and running and our major growth project expected to deliver first oil by year end were well set for a strong second half to  perhaps the one other thing that seems most top of mind to investors is the ma climate in light of recent transactions in the sector and the much lower – for much longer  environment what i would say is that beginning over five years ago suncor has maintained a strong balance sheet and as youve seen we treat this as a strategic asset we generate discretionary free cash flow that is after sustaining capital and dividend above a us wti price and we allocate that cash in a disciplined manner with a focus on returns between organic growth ma and share buybacks so as you look to the future judge us by what weve done in the past we will continue to make disciplined choices always targeting the best returns for shareholders so with that ill turn over to our chief financial officer alister cowan to go into some more detail on our financial performance alister cowan  suncor energy inc thanks steve and as steve mentioned earlier in the call in the second quarter we saw average benchmark crude prices fall by about us and towards the end of the quarter we saw the canadian dollar strengthened sharply against us dollar nevertheless we did produce solid financial results once again we generated as steve said over cad  billion in funds from operations approximately cad  million in operating earnings notably our ep business produced well above expectations and generated approximately cad  million in funds flow and our refining and marketing delivered over cad  million of funds flow despite a negative fifo impact as a result of falling crude prices this is very consistent with last years strong second quarter in rm after adjusting for  and the lubricants sale which was completed in the first quarter of this year our funds from operations for the quarter more than covered our sustaining capital spending of cad  million and our dividends of approximately cad  million leaving almost cad  million in discretionary free cash flow over the last  months we have generated over cad  billion in discretionary free cash flow and as steve said after sustaining capital underpinned of the dividend a key contributor to the free cash flow generation is our continued success in reducing costs across the business now everyones aware of the steady reduction in our oil sands cash costs in the past few years and thats certainly a very considerable accomplishment but i just wanted to emphasize its not only in our oil sands operations that were improving productivity and driving our cost right across the company weve been steadily streamlining business processes eliminating nonvalue added work and increasing productivity in the first half of  our total operating selling and general expenses were more than  lower than the first half of  and at the same time our total production increased by almost  the result is youre seeing as lower breakeven cost and increase cash flow on the capital front weve invested close to cad  billion in the second quarter bringing our yeartodate total growth and sustained capital spend to almost cad  billion progress on fort hills project accelerated during the quarter and we now see the potential to advance work that was planned for early  into this year accordingly weve increased the capital spending guidance range for  to cad  billion to cad  billion now to be honest weve had some concerns about this but let me assure you that this is simply an adjustment in the timing of the spend the  capital budget will be reduced  with the increase in this years spend our balance sheet continues to be a key strength for suncor we finished the quarter with approximately cad  billion in cash and over cad  billion of liquidity during the quarter we repaid us billion of longterm debt our net debt to cash flow decreased to less than two times and our debt to capitalization fell to approximately  both within their target ranges we expect debt levels to continue to decline organically as our production and cash flow increase moving forward on our last call weve announced the initiation of a cad  billion one year share buyback program which we commenced on may  weve been aggressively executing on the program for almost three months now to give you a bit of an update as of today we have repurchased and canceled over  million shares for approximately cad  million so we have been quite aggressive in july on this program the buyback program was  in the low us range with funds coming from our discretion free cash flow now as everyone is aware the oil prices fell during the quarter and while the shortterm trend and those oil prices have not influenced us to repurchases we do believe its prudent to flex the program based on the discretionary free cash flow in light of the current business environment irrespective of oil prices you can expect suncor to continue its focus on reducing costs carefully allocating our capital and following  competitive returns for our shareholders and im now going to pass it back to steve douglas stephen douglas  suncor energy inc well thank you alister and steve just a few things to note before we go to the questions there was a falling crude prices as alister noted and so there was a fifo expense of cad  million aftertax and that brings yeartodate to very close to zero a cad  billion positive yeartodate our stockbased compensation during the quarter was an aftertax expense of cad  million bringing the yeartodate total to cad  million aftertax and the fx impact was actually a cad  million gain in the second quarter bringing us to a cad  million gain yeartodate there are as steve and alister mentioned a number of changes to our guidance the updated guidance is available on our website suncorcom but a few of the highlights we did as mentioned increased the capital spending range up to cad  billion to cad  billion for the year and we will be reducing our  budget accordingly due to strong performance and outlook the ep production range has been raised by a further  barrels per day and as a result of the extended outage at syncrude the production range there has been lowered by the same amount  barrels per day so the net impact is no change to our  production range of  to  barrels per day the suncor oil sands cash cost range has been reduced by cad  to cad  to cad  per barrel as a result of a strong yeartodate cost management and syncrude cash costs have been increased to us to us a barrel reflecting the impact of the extended outage cash taxes have been increased by cad  million and thats primarily to reflect the higher cash taxes associated with increased north sea production and i should note that the range excludes the cash taxes associated with the lubricants and wind farms sales earlier this year theres also a number of small changes made to the business environment assumptions and those are simply based on yeartodate actuals and expectations going forward with that ill turn it back to michelle to take questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of greg pardy with rbs sic rbc  capital your line is open please go ahead greg pardy  rbc dominion securities inc thanks thanks good morning steve really just want to dig into a couple of areas not surprisingly probably the syncrude and fort hills but maybe just before that in terms of the capital increase that youve got this year how much of that is related to call it the syncrude repair work and it sounds as though youll be able to recover a bunch of that through insurance is that right steven w williams  suncor energy inc yeah i mean we havent been explicit about the breakdown but yes in excess of cad  million has to do with the work at syncrude of which a large proportion of that is capex and we would expect to get a recovery we cant be absolutely sure of the timing of the recovery so weve been prudent in the allowance so the cad  million is the balance of fort hills and syncrude as alister said the fort hills piece is really just timing were still anticipating on fort hills that we will come in towards the top end of the range we guided on earlier in the year greg pardy  rbc dominion securities inc okay great and just with syncrude can you touch maybe on just whats going right whats going wrong and just how youre thinking about the rampup coming into august steven w williams  suncor energy inc yeah i mean first of all perhaps its worth just giving a snapshot of where we are operationally today and ill do it a little bit broader than just syncrude i mean syncrude is already up at – between  and  of its nameplate capacity this morning so were already exporting well in excess of  barrels a day and  today so its already in that  to  range  i am talking current operations the base plant firebag mackay river are up at full throughputs and have been for most of july so although i find the results unacceptable to me through the second quarter theyre very much back on target already in the third quarter but to get back to your comments greg overall im not completely surprised by the syncrude performance we did talk about it not being a straight line there would be – we have very good operation and even when we had the good operation last year i said we didnt build that in to expectations every day just yet we are absolutely confident in the  and – to  utilization and a subcad  a barrel in that  time range we are working those programs in detail great work going on between ourselves imperial exxon and syncrude itself and we will bring that and  well bring that out and show you that in a lot more detail its also quite clear to us that the synergies are higher than weve anticipated both in the daytoday operation of the plant and the way we believe we will manage it going forward but also in terms of those other synergies i talked about how we connect the plant how we can get – when we increase the utilization of these noncore base facilities it was a how  we got security of bitumen supplies from three or four sources rather than one we can do some of that with syncrude by cross connecting some of the bitumen supplies you can keep the upgraders and export to market going longer by having connections on the product side between the players  so those projects are moving ahead with some pace now so im very comfortable in the longterm – disappointed but not completely surprised in the shortterm greg pardy  rbc dominion securities inc thanks for that and maybe just the last one is you touched on the – just the commercial discipline  with fort hills can you – can you elaborate on that at all steven w williams  suncor energy inc i mean its a little bit early literally were only a few days into the discussion so its too early for me to comment in detail on the dispute itself what i would say is the plant is  complete as of today so were really on the final stretches suncor and teck remain completely aligned in our approach to the project and i am not anticipating any impact on cost and schedule so if anything there is what we discussed today about the – because we get within  progress – very good progress on the project so what were planning to do is to finish off the bulk of it this year what that means is it positions us much better then for – no water introduction through the winter will be done all prefreezing season and well be able to move into the startup with a high degree of confidence so the project itself the brick and mortar piece of it is in really good shape were still talking about the possibility of a first intermediate product sometime in september or october and were still talking about the first train up at the end of the year and then progressively starting the other two trains up in the early part of next year so that bodes very well for the rampup next year greg pardy  rbc dominion securities inc thanks steve operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of neil mehta with goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead neil mehta  goldman sachs  co good morning guys first question is related to the fx strength the cadusd and we recognize that you lowered the cost guidance here today as part of the release could you just talk about how that exchange rate change can – makes you think about the cost structure going forward and i have a followup alister cowan  suncor energy inc yeah neil i mean the change in the operating cost guidance we gave on the oil sands operations is really just – its got nothing to do with the fx it is all to do with us driving cost out of the business in a sustainable manner i mean on the fx with the pluses and minus we take some negative impacts on the oil prices that translated back into canadian dollars but you saw the fx gain offsetting that as we translate our us dollar debt so on a netnet basis we manage it through the balance sheet and so we dont typically go forward  hedge it and we dont really see big of an impact on the equating  cost structure of the business neil mehta  goldman sachs  co thats great second is the strengthen ep has surprised us over the course of the year can you just talk about where youre seeing that strength  elsewhere and how sustainable is that going forward steven w williams  suncor energy inc hi yeah i mean we are very pleased with both the production and operating costs in that offshore business and neil as you know it is a highly cash generative business we have been investing albeit at not very material levels to suncor but we have been investing in a very selective targeted way and were starting to see the strong returns from those investments so you will see us continue to do that its all of those if you like so it is broadly across the operations theyve done exceedingly well and as we move towards the end of this year youre going to see the ramp up of hebron as well so although its not – its a very important part of our business weve always – i often get questions about the divestment of that business and i said we do see it as a part of our integrated business it gives us some diversity so when we see some trends in other parts its a very robust cash generator for us so im pleased that strategy has been working and  we plan to continue it neil mehta  goldman sachs  co great last question for me is just around share repurchase just going back to your comments alister it sounds like if im interpreting what youre saying is if oil stays around us a barrel we should assume that you continue to execute the program if it falls to the lower end of a range of call it us you take your foot off the pedal a little bit and if it goes above us you get a little bit more aggressive i might be putting words in your mouth and i am trying to create a formula where there might not be one but any comments there would be great steven w williams  suncor energy inc i mean yeah let me just do it from me if you like youve heard alister speak but let me just give you a slightly different cut i think youve nailed in a sense i mean the flex we have in our capital allocation is we are committed to our dividend we have capital expenditure on organic stuff which is starting to come to an end but you know those programs are disciplined and executed over a period and we tend not to slow down or speed those up so the piece of flexibility in our capital allocation is share buybacks and you know weve never given specific targets per se but i think we were quite clear we talked about cad  billion in the range we were looking at which was in that mids type range so youll see us just be prudent and flex share buybacks up and down neil mehta  goldman sachs  co perfect thank you alister cowan  suncor energy inc i would just add to that neil we have bought just under cad  million of stock in the last three months when our prices were in the sort of certainly at the  lower end of the range but the flex is there and we will utilize it when we need to neil mehta  goldman sachs  co perfect thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of roger read with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead roger d read  wells fargo securities llc yeah thanks good morning steven w williams  suncor energy inc good morning roger roger d read  wells fargo securities llc hopefully okay good yeah i just wanted to kind of come back on some of the opex questions but maybe starting with syncrude as you know you had the downtime planned you had the fire as youve gone through the restart process and then work is this something we can identify as an equipment issue is it a process issue within syncrude or you know we are talking about too few or maybe not quite the right people in place steven w williams  suncor energy inc no this is a specific equipment issue which is unlikely to be repeated so its not something – thats what im confident  the longer term this is what we in the industry call a process dead leg so because theres a valve in a line theres a line that has no flow in it so we specifically understand the issue not likely to be repeated and weve worked across the plant to identify and remove them so no its a once off its unfortunate but not reflective of what youre going to see in terms of the improved utilization and reduced costs and you know as i say not a complete surprise because you do get these things happen occasionally but  im so confident well get to a  plus utilization and cad  because this doesnt  interrupt that program roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay and actually that kind of steps into my next question as you think about the opex performance over the last year i think in the press release some of that is obviously due to lower natural gas prices but where do you think you are in sort of the – where you are today where you want to be with opex as a sort of a percentile marker and im thinking both the oil sands and the ep side business steven w williams  suncor energy inc okay i mean let me just give you some general comments i mean clearly it is an industry we benefited from lower gas prices for a number of years now but they havent changed significantly through this period so know the costs youre seeing quarteronquarter and yearonyear are not largely driven by reduced energy cost theyre primarily driven by a structured program of working hard to drive systematically cost out of the system so both in oil sands and ep and in the downstream you are seeing in fact in the corporate center as well we have a program in each of those areas in terms of the cost reductions and i mean we can be more specific off of the core  if you like but just generally something like approximately  of those costs we think are systematic and irreversible so those have come out and will stay out we havent finished yet its a continuous program weve made some good spikes particularly in the oil sands business again in this last quarter so youre going to start to see that in future quarters as we go forward in terms of longterm objectives and ill just talk about our base oil sands operations i still have certain ambitious target for the guys to get us at some speed  below cad  operating cost so its a mid to longer term project were still working towards it but i can see us getting there i mean were making – the strides we are making are fantastic i think  progress will make some of it will be further refining our people systems our processes the way our supply chain works but weve also got some technology things weve been working on so if you think of all the work weve been doing on autonomous trucks if you think of all the work weve been doing on different in situ techniques they come with comments or reductions in operating costs as well so we still got the program were working really hard at it and theres more to come roger d read  wells fargo securities llc okay great i appreciate it thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of phil gresh with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead john m royall  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is john royall sitting in for phil on the capex rates could you tell us how much has already occurred in q versus to come  for the rest of the year alister cowan  suncor energy inc sorry john could you repeat the question i didnt quite catch that john m royall  jpmorgan securities llc yeah the capex rates just wanted to know how much of it is related to things that have occurred in q versus raises for the second half alister cowan  suncor energy inc yeah were pretty much on budget as of today our yeartodate most of that will be an acceleration in the second half of the year john m royall  jpmorgan securities llc okay great and then i think you talked about driving towards longer term cad  billion allin capex number is that still a good number to think about particularly in light of everything thats going on with syncrude and it would be as early as  that you would think about that number steven w williams  suncor energy inc no were talking broadly cad  billion and weve talked about it – thats a good number to put into your multiple we talked about that for  and  so they are good numbers of course what alister said this morning they are obviously approximate numbers but you can expect the money we brought forward to come out of the  budget so you will see a decrease from that cad  billion john m royall  jpmorgan securities llc okay great and i know youve touched on it a little bit could you go into some more detail on the nature and the scope of exactly what youre doing in fort hills for the – related to the capex rates steven w williams  suncor energy inc sorry john your line just broke up slightly at the end could you repeat your question john m royall  jpmorgan securities llc yeah if you could just give a little more detail on the scope of what youre doing at fort hills with the capex rates i know you mentioned it a little in the remarks steven w williams  suncor energy inc its simply – weve got the opportunity what we are finding is that the progress we are making on secondary extraction is above the targets we had in so we have been able to see the opportunity by retaining the workforce more this year to be able to get the major pieces of that project complete and all of the hydro testing complete this year wed always planned that for the first train there are two other trains it looks as though were going to be able to do that with the productivity that we have this year so its simply bringing that from  into  john m royall  jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator thank you operating instructions our next question comes from the line of frank mcgann with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open please go ahead frank mcgann  bank of american merrill lynch yes thank you very much yeah if we could go back to the total dispute just to get a little bit more clarity on is this primarily commercial strategic technical is it primarily related to the capex increase what is actually driving that and assuming that they were not to go along with all of the spending does that – would that change the eventual ownership percentages as a result of a carry that you might undertake for them steven w williams  suncor energy inc yeah i mean as i said its too early for all of that were a few days into it i mean as i said were  complete so this is largely – theyre not very material conversations in terms of the context of the project it is a commercial discussion not a technical discussion and i think – i got asked several times last time on the call are total looking to sell parts of their project we know that they have been looking at various strategies but in this case this is a commercial discussion between ourselves and total too early to talk about the detail the reassuring message i would like investors to take away is were  complete were not anticipating this affecting either the cost or the schedule of the remainder of the project so frustrating at this stage but not that significant frank mcgann  bank of american merrill lynch okay thanks and if i could just followup just in terms of overall cost trends are you seeing any signs of pressure at any parts of your business steven w williams  suncor energy inc no not particularly – i mean were seeing particularly operating costs and capital costs still continue to move in the right direction frank mcgann  bank of american merrill lynch okay thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of travis wood with the national financial your line is open please go ahead travis wood  national bank financial yeah good morning guys just a question around the ep business it looks like results have been a bit better than expected so can you help us understand as hebron comes on and the ramp of that and what that could look like to the aggregate ep production profile over that ramp period alister cowan  suncor energy inc yeah travis i think weve been clear that its a threeyear rampup on hebron as we drill the additional wells or the production wells over the next few years from the platform that will rampup in     and then about  a day in  so obviously thatll offset some of the declines that were obviously going to see in the whole ep portfolio without the rampup on hebron travis wood  national bank financial okay and do you think that more than offsets the other declining parts of the portfolio alister cowan  suncor energy inc yeah to a certain extent yes we should see some increases in ep production but i would caution you its not the whole thing there is some declines coming in over the period as well travis wood  national bank financial okay great steven w williams  suncor energy inc yeah that sees that business remaining where it is or maybe even slightly better due to the middle maybe slightly beyond in the next decade travis wood  national bank financial okay thank you i appreciate that thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dan healing with the canadian press your line is open please go ahead dan healing  the canadian press good morning thanks for taking my question im just wondering if you can be a bit more specific on what the dispute with total involves you said it involves funding is that funding for the portion of the capital costs that have been moved forward or is that for funding farther down the line steven w williams  suncor energy inc i mean no its very early stages of the dispute its inappropriate for me to talk in any more detail than i have done the project is  complete so you know were very close to the end of – the end of the spend its a commercial discussion which is not that unusual at this stage in a project of this size and most of the spend is really set to the end of the project we have  people on site finishing it off and three quarters of the plant is in the hands of the operators and its being started up so its not unusual to have these discussions at this time dan healing  the canadian press okay if its not unusual and these kinds of things happen all the time i guess im wondering why youre bringing it up on a conference call steve steven w williams  suncor energy inc because its – we are very transparent about where we are and we think its important to keep our investors fully appraised of where the project is dan healing  the canadian press okay thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jeff lewis with the the globe  mail inc your line is open please go ahead jeff lewis  the globe  mail inc hi i just had two quick questions one about the share buyback can you just clarify are you suspending the share buyback now or just signaling that you have room to sort of tap the brakes on those steven w williams  suncor energy inc no were not suspending the share buyback as alister said we bought about cad  million worth of our shares back over the last period we anticipate – were still buying as we speak today but we buy our stock back with our free cash after all of our other commitments and as that cash flow fluctuates depending on our spend and the price of crude well flex it back up and down but no were still committed to the program jeff lewis  the globe  mail inc so still the cad  billion i believe it was level for the year steven w williams  suncor energy inc thats our target but it will depend on free cash flow jeff lewis  the globe  mail inc okay and then just quickly transcanada has launched another open season for keystone xl do you see that project as still being necessary in todays market given some of the changes that weve seen steven w williams  suncor energy inc i mean we generally support all of the projects which are currently seeking access to markets that we support keystone support trans mountain we support the enbridge line  project all three of them seem to be making steady progress which im encouraged by and yeah i think you know we certainly need these projects and it depends on you know what time they come into service but no i think the projects are still needed in the industry and suncor is supporting them jeff lewis  the globe  mail inc so are you a shipper on keystone xl steven w williams  suncor energy inc yes and were already a shipper on the lower half of keystone which is already operational stephen douglas  suncor energy inc i think we can go to the next question operator operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nia williams with reuters your line is open please go ahead nia williams  reuters hi there can you give us a sense of what level wti suncor needs to breakeven in its oil sands operation i know youve spoken about operating costs but im just wondering once you put in ga costs in transportation and blend in what the breakeven number is alister cowan  suncor energy inc okay i think weve been very clear on this but the breakeven cost for suncor to cover its operating cost on
