in the korean peninsula during and after the korean war south koreas rigorous education system and the establishment of a highly motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the countrys high technology boom and rapid economic development having almost no natural resources and always suffering from overpopulation in its small territory which deterred continued population

ultimately helped the adoption and development of faster mobile standards for the economy of south korea the growth of ict industry has been far concentrated on the hardware sector which focuses on expanding wired and wireless telecommunication network penetration rather than the software sector which creates innovative applications and valueadded services the economy of south korea is the

potential and apparent structural stability south korea suffers perpetual damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to the belligerence of north korea in times of deep military crises which has an adverse effect on the financial markets of the south korean economy however renowned financial organizations such as the international monetary fund also compliment the resilience of the south korean economy against various economic crises citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address any expected financial emergencies other financial organizations like the world bank describe korea as one of the fastestgrowing major economies of the next generation along with bric and indonesia south korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to

following the korean war south korea remained one of the poorest countries in the world for over a decade in  its gross domestic product per capita was  lower than that of some subsaharan countries the growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to economic development in  manufacturing industries accounted for approximately  percent of the gross domestic product gdp and  percent of the work force benefiting from strong domestic encouragement and foreign aid seouls industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities at a rapid pace increased the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion as a result industry altered the countrys landscape drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers a downturn in the south korean economy in  spurred by a sharp decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the industrial sector ministry of trade and industry analysts stated that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded in the nations economy including an overly strong won increased wages and high labor costs frequent strikes and high interest rates the result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in production at a number of electronics automobile and textile manufacturers as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labor to boost productivity with a much smaller work force and to improve competitiveness it was estimated that over twothirds of south koreas manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for facility investments on automation currently korea is a developed country with a developed market rapid growth from s to sedit south koreas real gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than  percent per year from us billion in  to us billion in  breaking the trillion dollar mark in  nominal gdp per capita grew from  in  to  in  reaching the  milestone in  the manufacturing sector grew from  percent of the gnp in  to  percent in  commodity trade volume rose from us million in  to a projected us billion in  the ratio of domestic savings to gnp grew from  percent in  to  percent in  in  south koreas rate of growth first exceeded north koreas rate of growth in most industrial areas though south koreas per capita gnp was still lower the most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early scitation needed this strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of south koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market the strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which south korea could develop a competitive advantage government initiatives played an important role in this process through the model of exportled industrialization the south korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highlycompetitive global market by adhering to state regulations and demands firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fastpaced evolving international arena in addition the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings these efforts enabled south korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income by emphasizing the industrial sector seouls exportoriented development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped except for mining most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast heavy industries generally were located in the south of the country factories in seoul contributed over  percent of all manufacturing valueadded in  taken together with factories in surrounding gyeonggi province factories in the seoul area produced  percent of all manufacturing that year factories in seoul and gyeonggi province employed  percent of the nations  million factory workers increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a serious problem by the s and remained a problem despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural living standards in the early s in order to control inflation a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted growth of the money supply was reduced from the  percent level of the s to  percent seoul even froze its budget for a short while government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote competition to reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors seoul expanded investments in public projects such as roads and communications facilities while further promoting farm mechanization the measures implemented early in the decade coupled with significant improvements in the world economy helped the south korean economy regain its lost momentum in the late s south korea achieved an average of  percent real growth between  and  and  percent between  and  the doubledigit inflation of the s was brought under control wholesale price inflation averaged  percent per year from  through  consumer prices increased by an average of  percent annually seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance of payments in  and recorded a us billion and a

gdp things changed quickly in  with the asian financial crisis after several other asian currencies were attacked by speculators the korean won started to heavily depreciate in october  the problem

negative quarterly growth in  years with year on year quarterly growth continuing to be negative into  most sectors of the economy reported declines with manufacturing dropping  as of january  and consumer goods sales dropping  exports in autos and semiconductors two critical pillars of the economy shrank  and  respectively while exports overall fell by a record  in january and  in february  year on year as in the  crisis koreas currency also experienced massive fluctuations declining by  against the dollar annual growth in the economy slowed to  in  and was expected to drop to as low as  by goldman sachs but south korea was able to limit the downturn to a near standstill at  in  despite the global financial crisis the south korean economy helped by timely stimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated for a drop in exports was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialized economies posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of the crisis in  south korea made a strong economic rebound with a growth rate of  signaling a return of the economy to precrisis levels south koreas export has recorded  billion in the first eleven months of the year  already higher than its export in the whole year of  the south korean economy of the st century as a next eleven economy is expected to grow from  to  annually between  and  similar to growth rates of developing countries such as brazil or russia the south korean government signed the koreaaustralia free trade agreement kafta on december   with the australian government seeking to benefit its numerous industries—including automotive services and resources and energy—and position itself alongside competitors such as the us and asean south korea is australia’s third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a  trade value of a billion the agreement contains an investor state dispute settlement isds clause that permits legal action from south korean corporations against the australian government if their trade rights are infringed upon the government cut the work week from six days to five in phases from  to  depending on the size of the

manufacturers planned a significant shift in future production plans toward hightechnology industries in june  panels of government officials scholars and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials mechatronics—including industrial robotics—bioengineering microelectronics fine chemistry and aerospace this shift in emphasis however did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production which had dominated the economy in the scitation needed south korea relies largely upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy with finished products such as electronics textiles ships automobiles and steel being some of its most important exports although the import market has liberalized in recent years the agricultural market has remained largely protectionist due to serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market as of  the price of rice in south korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on the international market and it was generally feared that opening the agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the south korean agricultural sector in late  however an agreement was reached with the wto in which south korean rice imports will gradually increase from  to  of consumption by  in addition up to  of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by  where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods following  the south korean rice market will be fully openedcitation

industry of south korea that boomed since the s during the s and s south korea became a leading producer of ships including oil supertankers and oildrilling platforms the countrys major shipbuilder was hyundai which built a millionton capacity drydock at ulsan in the mids daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in  and finished a millionton facility at okpo on geoje island south of busan in mid the industry declined in the mids because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession there was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late s new orders for  totaled  million gross tons valued at us billion decreases from the previous year of  percent and  percent respectively these declines were caused by labor unrest seouls unwillingness to provide financial assistance and tokyos new lowinterest export financing in support of japanese shipbuilders however the south korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing south korea eventually became the worlds dominant shipbuilder with a  share of the global shipbuilding market as of  notable korean shipbuilders are hyundai heavy industries samsung heavy industries

since the early s and remains a critical source of foreign currency and invisible export earnings by  overseas construction projects most of them in the middle east accounted for  percent of the work undertaken by south korean construction companies contracts that year were valued at us billion in  however overseas construction contracts totaled only us billion orders from the middle east were us billion a  percent increase over the previous year while new orders for domestic construction projects totaled us billion an  percent increase over  breakwater construction in seosan coast  south korean construction companies therefore concentrated on the rapidly growing domestic market in the late s by  there were signs of a revival of the overseas construction market the dong ah construction

elaboration of president richard m nixons policy of vietnamization in the early s south korea began to manufacture many of its own weapons since the s south korea now in possession of more modern military technology than in previous generations has actively begun shifting its defense industrys areas of interest more from its previously homeland defenseoriented militarization efforts to the

economy of south korea is the fourth largest economy in asia and the th largest in the world it is a mixed economy dominated by familyowned conglomerates called chaebols however the dominance of chaebol is unlikely and at risk to support the transformation of korean economy for the future generations south korea is famous for its spectacular rise from one of the poorest countries in the world to a developed highincome country in just one generation this economic miracle commonly known as the miracle on the han river brought south korea to the ranks of elite countries in the oecd and the g

in the korean peninsula during and after the korean war south koreas rigorous education system and the establishment of a highly motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the countrys high technology boom and rapid economic development having almost no natural resources and always suffering from overpopulation in its small territory which deterred continued population growth and the formation of a large internal consumer market south korea adapted an exportoriented economic strategy to fuel its economy and in  south korea was the seventh largest exporter and seventh largest importer in the world bank of korea and korea development institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of south korea in the  asian financial crisis the south korean economy suffered a liquidity crisis and relied on the bailout by the imf that restructured and modernized the south korean economy with successive djnomics policy by president kim dae jung including the resultant of the national development of the ict industry historically subsidies were used as means of speeding up adoption of new technology in korea and has ultimately helped the adoption and development of faster mobile standards for the economy of south korea the growth of ict industry has been far concentrated on the hardware sector which focuses on expanding wired and wireless telecommunication network penetration rather than the software sector which creates innovative applications and valueadded services the economy of south korea is the global leader of consumer electronics mobile broadband and smartphones south koreas lcd tv global market share also jumped to  percent in  from  percent at the end of  and it will soon replace japan as the world’s numberone lcd tv supplier the economy of south korea ranks no in the world in ict development index   and  bloomberg innovation index despite the south korean economys high growth potential and apparent structural stability south korea suffers perpetual damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to the belligerence of north korea in times of deep military crises which has an adverse effect on the financial markets of the south korean economy however renowned financial organizations such as the international monetary fund also compliment the resilience of the south korean economy against various economic crises citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address any expected financial emergencies other financial organizations like the world bank describe korea as one of the fastestgrowing major economies of the next generation along with bric and indonesia south korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession during the global financial crisis and its economic growth rate will reach  in  a sharp recovery from economic growth rates of  in  and  in  when the global financial crisis hit the

following the korean war south korea remained one of the poorest countries in the world for over a decade in  its gross domestic product per capita was  lower than that of some subsaharan countries the growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to economic development in  manufacturing industries accounted for approximately  percent of the gross domestic product gdp and  percent of the work force benefiting from strong domestic encouragement and foreign aid seouls industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities at a rapid pace increased the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion as a result industry altered the countrys landscape drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers a downturn in the south korean economy in  spurred by a sharp decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the industrial sector ministry of trade and industry analysts stated that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded in the nations economy including an overly strong won increased wages and high labor costs frequent strikes and high interest rates the result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in production at a number of electronics automobile and textile manufacturers as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labor to boost productivity with a much smaller work force and to improve competitiveness it was estimated that over twothirds of south koreas manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for facility investments on automation currently korea is a developed country with a developed market rapid growth from s to sedit south koreas real gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than  percent per year from us billion in  to us billion in  breaking the trillion dollar mark in  nominal gdp per capita grew from  in  to  in  reaching the  milestone in  the manufacturing sector grew from  percent of the gnp in  to  percent in  commodity trade volume rose from us million in  to a projected us billion in  the ratio of domestic savings to gnp grew from  percent in  to  percent in  in  south koreas rate of growth first exceeded north koreas rate of growth in most industrial areas though south koreas per capita gnp was still lower the most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early scitation needed this strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of south koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market the strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which south korea could develop a competitive advantage government initiatives played an important role in this process through the model of exportled industrialization the south korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highlycompetitive global market by adhering to state regulations and demands firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fastpaced evolving international arena in addition the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings these efforts enabled south korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income by emphasizing the industrial sector seouls exportoriented development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped except for mining most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast heavy industries generally were located in the south of the country factories in seoul contributed over  percent of all manufacturing valueadded in  taken together with factories in surrounding gyeonggi province factories in the seoul area produced  percent of all manufacturing that year factories in seoul and gyeonggi province employed  percent of the nations  million factory workers increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a serious problem by the s and remained a problem despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural living standards in the early s in order to control inflation a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted growth of the money supply was reduced from the  percent level of the s to  percent seoul even froze its budget for a short while government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote competition to reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors seoul expanded investments in public projects such as roads and communications facilities while further promoting farm mechanization the measures implemented early in the decade coupled with significant improvements in the world economy helped the south korean economy regain its lost momentum in the late s south korea achieved an average of  percent real growth between  and  and  percent between  and  the doubledigit inflation of the s was brought under control wholesale price inflation averaged  percent per year from  through  consumer prices increased by an average of  percent annually seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance of payments in  and recorded a us billion and a

gdp things changed quickly in  with the asian financial crisis after several other asian currencies were attacked by speculators the korean won started to heavily depreciate in october  the problem

domestic consumption of products that compensated for a drop in exports was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialized economies posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of

largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a  trade value of a billion the agreement contains an investor state dispute settlement isds clause that permits legal action from south

manufacturers planned a significant shift in future production plans toward hightechnology industries in june  panels of government officials scholars and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials mechatronics—including industrial robotics—bioengineering microelectronics fine chemistry and aerospace this shift in emphasis however did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production which had dominated the economy in the scitation needed south korea relies largely upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy with finished products such as electronics textiles ships automobiles and steel being some of its most important exports although the import market has liberalized in recent years the agricultural market has remained largely protectionist due to serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market as of  the price of rice in south korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on the international market and it was generally feared that opening the agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the south korean agricultural sector in late  however an agreement was reached with the wto in which south korean rice imports will gradually increase from  to  of consumption by  in addition up to  of

was hyundai which built a millionton capacity drydock at ulsan in the mids daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in  and finished a millionton facility at okpo on geoje island south of busan in mid

elaboration of president richard m nixons policy of vietnamization in the early s south korea began to manufacture many of its own weapons since the s south korea now in possession of more modern military technology than in previous generations has actively begun shifting its defense industrys areas of interest more from its previously homeland defenseoriented militarization efforts to the

the name korea is derived from goguryeo also known as koryŏ one of the three kingdoms of korea the name korea derives from the name goryeo the name goryeo itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of goguryeo in the th century as a shortened form of its name the thcentury kingdom of goryeo succeeded goguryeo and thus inherited its name which was pronounced by visiting persian merchants as korea the modern spelling of korea first appeared in the late th century in the travel writings of the dutch east india companys hendrick hamel despite the coexistence of the spellings corea and korea in th century publications some koreans believe that imperial japan around the time of the japanese occupation intentionally standardised the spelling on korea making japan appear first alphabetically after goryeo was replaced by joseon in  joseon became the official name for the entire territory though it was not universally accepted the new official name has its origin in the ancient country of gojoseon old joseon in  the joseon dynasty changed the official name of the country from joseon to daehan jeguk korean empire the name daehan which means great han literally derives from samhan three hans however the name joseon was still widely used by koreans to refer to their country though it was no longer the official name under japanese rule the two names han and joseon coexisted there were several groups who fought for independence the most notable being the provisional government of the republic of korea 대한민국 임시정부臨時政府 following the surrender of japan in  the republic of korea 대한민국 was adopted as the legal name for the new country since the government only controlled the southern part of the korean peninsula the informal term south korea was coined becoming increasingly common in the western world while south koreans use han or hanguk to refer to the entire country north koreans and koreans in china use the term joseon as the name of the country historyedit main article

goryeo created the worlds first metalbased movable type in  the tripitaka koreana — the buddhist canon tripiṭaka carved onto roughly  woodblocks and stored and still remaining at haeinsa a world heritage site changdeok palace one of the five grand palaces built during the joseon dynasty and a world heritage site the history of korea begins with the founding of joseon also known as gojoseon or old joseon to differentiate it with the th century dynasty in  bc by dangun according to koreas foundation mythology gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the th century bc but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in  bc the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades but the lelang commandery remained as a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive chinese dynasties for four centuries until it was conquered by goguryeo in  three kingdoms of koreaedit during the period known as the proto–three kingdoms of korea the states of buyeo okjeo dongye and samhan occupied the korean peninsula and southern manchuria from them goguryeo baekje and silla emerged to control the peninsula as the three kingdoms of korea goguryeo the largest and most powerful among them was a highly militaristic state and competed with various chinese dynasties during its  years of history goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties most notably the goguryeo–sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men baekje was a great maritime power its nautical skill which made it the phoenicia of east asia was instrumental in the dissemination of buddhism throughout east asia and continental culture to japan baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula especially during the time of geunchogo but was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage the unification of the three kingdoms by silla in  led to the north south states period in which much of the korean peninsula was controlled by later silla while balhae controlled the northern parts of goguryeo balhae was founded by a goguryeo general and formed as a successor state to goguryeo during its height balhae controlled most of manchuria and parts of the russian far east and was called the prosperous country in the east later silla was a golden age of art and culture as evidenced by the hwangnyongsa seokguram and emille bell relationships between korea and china remained relatively peaceful during this time later silla carried on the maritime prowess of baekje which acted like the phoenicia of medieval east asia and during the th and th centuries dominated the seas of east asia and the trade between china korea and japan most notably during the time of jang bogo in addition silla people made overseas communities in china on the shandong peninsula and the mouth of the yangtze river later silla was a prosperous and wealthy country and its metropolitan capital of gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world buddhism flourished during this time and many korean buddhists gained great fame among chinese buddhists and contributed to chinese buddhism including woncheuk wonhyo uisang musang and kim gyogak a silla prince whose influence made mount jiuhua one of the four sacred mountains of chinese buddhism however later silla weakened under internal strife and the revival of baekje and goguryeo which led to the later three kingdoms period in the late th century unified dynastiesedit in  the later three kingdoms were united by wang geon a descendant of goguryeo nobility who established goryeo as the successor state of goguryeo balhae had fallen to the khitan empire in  and a decade later the last crown prince of balhae fled south to goryeo where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by wang geon thus unifying the two successor nations of goguryeo like silla goryeo was a highly cultural state and invented the metal movable type printing press after defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time in the goryeo–khitan war goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science by  there were  universities that produced famous scholars and scientists however the mongol invasions in the th century greatly weakened the kingdom goryeo was never conquered by the mongols but exhausted after three decades of fighting the korean court sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to kublai khan who accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince henceforth goryeo continued to rule korea though as a tributary ally to the mongols for the next  years during this period the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess in the midth century goryeo drove out the mongols to regain its northern territories briefly conquered liaoyang and defeated invasions by the red turbans however in  general yi seonggye who had been ordered to attack china turned his army around and staged a coup yi seonggye declared the new name of korea as joseon in reference to gojoseon and moved the capital to hanseong one of the old names of seoul the first  years of the joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education as well as the creation of hangul by sejong the great to promote literacy among the common people the prevailing ideology of the time was neoconfucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity between  and  toyotomi hideyoshi launched invasions of korea but his advance was halted by korean forces most notably the joseon navy led by admiral yi sunsin and his renowned turtle ship with assistance from righteous army militias formed by korean civilians and ming dynasty chinese troops through a series of successful battles of attrition the japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw and relations between all parties became normalized however the manchus took advantage of joseons warweakened state and invaded in  and  and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynasty after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the th century in the th century the royal inlaw families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country furthermore the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy earning the nickname the hermit kingdom but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders after the first sinojapanese war and the russojapanese war korea was occupied by japan – at the end of world war ii the japanese surrendered to soviet and us forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of korea respectively modern historyedit main article history of south korea war memorial of korea built in remembrance of the korean war – between  and  the south korean

korean economy through exportoriented industrialization president kim daejung the  nobel peace prize recipient for advancing democracy and human rights in south korea and east asia and for reconciliation with north korea was sometimes called the nelson mandela of asia korea was the first chair of the g during the  seoul summit despite the initial plan of a unified korea in the  cairo declaration escalating cold war antagonism between the soviet union and the united states eventually led to the establishment of separate governments each with its own ideology leading to the division of korea into two political entities in  north korea and south korea in the south syngman rhee an opponent of communism who had been backed and appointed by the united states as head of the provisional government won the first presidential elections of the newly declared republic of korea in may in the north a former antijapanese guerrilla and communist activist kim ilsung was appointed premier of the democratic peoples republic of korea in september in october the soviet union declared kim ilsungs government as sovereign over both parts the un declared rhees government as a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of korea where the un temporary commission on korea was able to observe and consult and the government based on elections which was observed by the temporary commission in addition to a statement that this is the only such government in korea both leaders began an authoritarian repression of their political opponents inside their region seeking for a unification of korea under their control while south koreas request for military support was denied by the united states north koreas military was heavily reinforced by the soviet union on june   north korea invaded south korea sparking the korean war the cold wars first major conflict which continued until  at the time the soviet union had boycotted the united nations un thus forfeiting their veto rights this allowed the un to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior north korean forces would unify the entire country the soviet union and china backed north korea with the later participation of millions of chinese troops after an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction and massive losses among korean civilians in both the north and the south the war eventually reached a stalemate the  armistice never signed by south korea split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line no peace treaty was ever signed resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war over  million people died during the korean war in  a student uprising the april  revolution led to the resignation of the autocratic corrupt president syngman rhee a period of political instability followed broken by general park chunghees may  coup against the weak and ineffectual government the next year park took over as president until his assassination in  overseeing rapid exportled economic growth as well as implementing political repression park was heavily criticised as a ruthless military dictator who in  extended his rule by creating a new constitution which gave the president sweeping almost dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of sixyear terms however the korean economy developed significantly during parks tenure and the government developed the nationwide expressway system the seoul subway system and laid the foundation for economic development during his year tenure the years after parks assassination were marked again by political turmoil as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void in  there came the coup détat of december twelfth led by general chun doohwan following the coup détat chun doohwan planned to rise to power through several measures on may  chun doohwan forced the cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation which had previously not applied to the island of jejudo the expanded martial law closed universities banned political activities and further curtailed the press chuns assumption of the presidency in the events of may  triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy in particular in the city of gwangju to which chun sent special forces to violently suppress the gwangju democratization movement chun subsequently created the national defense emergency policy committee and took the presidency according to his political plan chun and his government held south korea under a despotic rule until  when a seoul national university student park jongchul was tortured to death on june  the catholic priests association for justice revealed the incident igniting the june democracy movement around the country eventually chuns party the democratic justice party and its leader roh taewoo announced

recovered and continued its economic growth albeit at a slower pace in june  as part of president kim daejungs sunshine policy of engagement a north–south summit took place in pyongyang the capital of north korea later that year kim received the nobel peace prize for his work for democracy and human rights in south korea and in east asia in general and for peace and reconciliation with north korea in particular however because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the north under the previous administrations and amid north korean provocations a conservative government was elected in  led by president lee myungbak former mayor of seoul more recently park geunhye won the south korean presidential election  meanwhile south korea and japan jointly cohosted the  fifa

dominance over the waters off these shores    the days of korean maritime dominance in the far east actually were numbered but in ennins time the men of silla were still the masters of the seas in

fourth largest economy in asia and the th largest in the world it is a mixed economy dominated by familyowned conglomerates called chaebols however the dominance of chaebol is unlikely and at risk to support the transformation of korean economy for the future generations south korea is famous for its spectacular rise from one of the poorest countries in the world to a developed highincome country in just one generation this economic miracle commonly known as the miracle on the han river brought south korea to the ranks of elite countries in the oecd and the g south korea still remains one of the fastest growing developed countries in the world following the great recession it is included in the group of next eleven countries that will dominate the global economy in the middle of the st century by creating favorable policy directive for economic development as preceded by japanese economic recovery as the logistic supplying bastion for american troops in the korean peninsula during and after the korean war south koreas rigorous education system and the establishment of a highly motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the countrys high technology boom and rapid economic development having almost no natural resources and always suffering from overpopulation in its small territory which deterred continued population growth and the formation of a large internal consumer market south korea adapted an exportoriented economic strategy to fuel its economy and in  south korea was the seventh largest exporter and seventh largest importer in the world bank of korea and korea development institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of south korea in the  asian financial crisis the south korean economy suffered a liquidity crisis and relied on the bailout by the imf that restructured and modernized the south korean economy with successive djnomics policy by president kim dae jung including the resultant of the national development of the ict industry historically subsidies were used as means of speeding up adoption of new technology in korea and has ultimately helped the adoption and development of faster mobile standards for the economy of south korea the growth of ict industry has been far concentrated on the hardware sector which focuses on expanding wired and wireless telecommunication network penetration rather than the software sector which creates innovative applications and valueadded services the economy of south korea is the global leader of consumer electronics mobile broadband and smartphones south koreas lcd tv global market share also jumped to  percent in  from  percent at the end of  and it will soon replace japan as the world’s numberone lcd tv supplier the economy of south korea ranks no in the world in ict development index   and  bloomberg innovation index despite the south korean economys high growth potential and apparent structural stability south korea suffers perpetual damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to the belligerence of north korea in times of deep military crises which has an adverse effect on the financial markets of the south korean economy however renowned financial organizations such as the international monetary fund also compliment the resilience of the south korean economy against various economic crises citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address any expected financial emergencies other financial organizations like the world bank describe korea as one of the fastestgrowing major economies of the next generation along with bric and indonesia south korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession

output being the technology products exports south korea was a historical recipient of official development assistance oda from oecd throughout the s until the mids south koreas economic prosperity as measured in gdp by ppp per capita was still only a fraction of industrialized nations in  the south korean gdp per capita was  about onethird of nearby developed asian economies such as singapore hong kong and japan since then south korea has advanced into a developed economy to eventually attain a gdp per capita of  in  almost thirteen times the figure thirty years ago the whole countrys gdp increased from  billion to  billion in the same time frame in  south korea officially became the first major recipient of oda to have ascended to the status of a major donor of oda between  and  south

war south korea remained one of the poorest countries in the world for over a decade in  its gross domestic product per capita was  lower than that of some subsaharan countries the growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to economic development in  manufacturing industries accounted for approximately  percent of the gross domestic product gdp and  percent of the work force benefiting from strong domestic encouragement and foreign aid seouls industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities at a rapid pace increased the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion as a result industry altered the countrys landscape drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers a downturn in the south korean economy in  spurred by a sharp decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the industrial sector ministry of trade and industry analysts stated that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded in the nations economy including an overly strong won increased wages and high labor costs frequent strikes and high interest rates the result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in production at a number of electronics automobile and textile manufacturers as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labor to boost productivity with a much smaller work force and to improve competitiveness it was estimated that over twothirds of south koreas manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for facility investments on automation currently korea is a developed country with a developed market rapid growth from s to sedit south koreas real gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than  percent per year from us billion in  to us billion in  breaking the trillion dollar mark in  nominal gdp per capita grew from  in  to  in  reaching the  milestone in  the manufacturing sector grew from  percent of the gnp in  to  percent in  commodity trade volume rose from us million in  to a projected us billion in  the ratio of domestic savings to gnp grew from  percent in  to  percent in  in  south koreas rate of growth first exceeded north koreas rate of growth in most industrial areas though south koreas per capita gnp was still lower the most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early scitation needed this strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of south koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market the strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which south korea could develop a competitive advantage government initiatives played an important role in this process through the model of exportled industrialization the south korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highlycompetitive global market by adhering to state regulations and demands firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fastpaced evolving international arena in addition the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings these efforts enabled south korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income by emphasizing the industrial sector seouls exportoriented development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped except for mining most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast heavy industries generally were located in the south of the country factories in seoul contributed over  percent of all manufacturing valueadded in  taken together with factories in surrounding gyeonggi province factories in the seoul area produced  percent of all manufacturing that year factories in seoul and gyeonggi province employed  percent of the nations  million factory workers increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a serious problem by the s and remained a problem despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural living standards in the early s in order to control inflation a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted growth of the money supply was reduced from the  percent level of the s to  percent seoul even froze its budget for a short while government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote competition to reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors seoul expanded investments in public projects such as roads and communications facilities while further promoting farm mechanization the measures implemented early in the decade coupled with significant improvements in the world economy helped the south korean economy regain its lost momentum in the late s south korea achieved an average of  percent real growth between  and  and  percent between  and  the doubledigit inflation of the s was brought under control wholesale price inflation averaged  percent per year from  through  consumer prices increased by an average of  percent annually seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance of payments in  and recorded a us billion and a

gdp things changed quickly in  with the asian financial crisis after several other asian currencies were attacked by speculators the korean won started to heavily depreciate in october  the problem

domestic consumption of products that compensated for a drop in exports was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialized economies posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of

months of the year  already higher than its export in the whole year of  the south korean economy of the st century as a next eleven economy is expected to grow from  to  annually between  and  similar to growth rates of developing countries such as brazil or russia the south korean government signed the koreaaustralia free trade agreement kafta on december   with the australian government

largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a  trade value of a billion the agreement contains an investor state dispute settlement isds clause that permits legal action from south

manufacturers planned a significant shift in future production plans toward hightechnology industries in june  panels of government officials scholars and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials mechatronics—including industrial robotics—bioengineering microelectronics fine chemistry and aerospace this shift in emphasis however did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production which had dominated the economy in the scitation needed south korea relies largely upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy with finished products such as electronics textiles ships automobiles and steel being some of its most important exports although the import market has liberalized in recent years the agricultural market has remained largely protectionist due to serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market as of  the price of rice in south korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on the international market and it was generally feared that opening the agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the south korean agricultural sector in late  however an agreement was reached with the wto in which south korean rice imports will gradually increase from  to  of consumption by  in addition up to  of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by  where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods following  the south korean rice market will be fully openedcitation

industry of south korea that boomed since the s during the s and s south korea became a leading producer of ships including oil supertankers and oildrilling platforms the countrys major shipbuilder was hyundai which built a millionton capacity drydock at ulsan in the mids daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in  and finished a millionton facility at okpo on geoje island south of busan in mid the industry declined in the mids because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession there was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late s new orders for  totaled  million gross tons valued at us billion decreases from the previous year of  percent and  percent respectively these declines were caused by labor unrest seouls unwillingness to provide financial assistance and tokyos new lowinterest export financing in support of japanese shipbuilders however the south korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing

since the early s and remains a critical source of foreign currency and invisible export earnings by  overseas construction projects most of them in the middle east accounted for  percent of the work

industrialization allowed korea to produce increasingly advanced military equipment during the s south korea was largely dependent on the united states to supply its armed forces but after the elaboration of president richard m nixons policy of vietnamization in the early s south korea began to manufacture many of its own weapons since the s south korea now in possession of more modern military technology than in previous generations has actively begun shifting its defense industrys areas of interest more from its previously homeland defenseoriented militarization efforts to the promotion of military equipment and technology as mainstream products of exportation to boost its international trade some of its key military export projects include the t firtina selfpropelled

the name korea is derived from goguryeo also known as koryŏ one of the three kingdoms of korea the name korea derives from the name goryeo the name goryeo itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of goguryeo in the th century as a shortened form of its name the thcentury kingdom of goryeo succeeded goguryeo and thus inherited its name which was pronounced by visiting persian merchants as korea the modern spelling of korea first appeared in the late th century in the travel writings of the dutch east india companys hendrick hamel despite the coexistence of the spellings corea and korea in th century publications some koreans believe that imperial japan around the time of the japanese occupation intentionally standardised the spelling on korea making japan appear first alphabetically after goryeo was replaced by joseon in  joseon became the official name for the entire territory though it was not universally accepted the new official name has its origin in the ancient country of gojoseon old joseon in  the joseon dynasty changed the official name of the country from joseon to daehan jeguk korean empire the name daehan which means great han literally derives from samhan three hans however the name joseon was still widely used by koreans to refer to their country though it was no longer the official name under japanese rule the two names han and joseon coexisted there were several groups who fought for independence the most notable being the provisional government of the republic of korea 대한민국 임시정부臨時政府 following the surrender of japan in  the republic of korea 대한민국 was adopted as the legal name for the new country since the government only controlled the southern part of the korean peninsula the informal term south korea was coined becoming increasingly common in the western world while south koreans use han or hanguk to refer to the entire country north koreans and koreans in china use the term joseon as the name of the country historyedit main article history of korea ancient koreaedit seokguram grotto from the silla era a unesco world heritage site balhae and silla  ce the oldest surviving metal movable type book the jikji was printed in  and goryeo created the worlds first metalbased movable type in  the tripitaka koreana — the buddhist canon tripiṭaka carved onto roughly  woodblocks and stored and still remaining at haeinsa a world heritage site changdeok palace one of the five grand palaces built during the joseon dynasty and a world heritage site the history of korea begins with the founding of joseon also known as gojoseon or old joseon to differentiate it with the th century dynasty in  bc by dangun according to koreas foundation mythology gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria gija joseon was purportedly founded in the th century bc but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era in  bc the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades but the lelang commandery remained as a center of cultural and economic exchange with successive chinese dynasties for four centuries until it was conquered by goguryeo in  three kingdoms of koreaedit during the period known as the proto–three kingdoms of korea the states of buyeo okjeo dongye and samhan occupied the korean peninsula and southern manchuria from them goguryeo baekje and silla emerged to control the peninsula as the three kingdoms of korea goguryeo the largest and most powerful among them was a highly militaristic state and competed with various chinese dynasties during its  years of history goguryeo experienced a golden age under gwanggaeto the great and his son jangsu who both subdued baekje and silla during their times achieving a brief unification of the three kingdoms of korea and becoming the most dominant power on the korean peninsula in addition to contesting for control of the korean peninsula goguryeo had many military conflicts with various chinese dynasties most notably the goguryeo–sui war in which goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men baekje was a great maritime power its nautical skill which made it the phoenicia of east asia was instrumental in the dissemination of buddhism throughout east asia and continental culture to japan baekje was once a great military power on the korean peninsula especially during the time of geunchogo but was critically defeated by gwanggaeto the great and declined silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful korean kingdoms and eventually tang china to its great advantage the unification of the three kingdoms by silla in  led to the north south states period in which much of the korean peninsula was controlled by later silla while balhae controlled the northern parts of goguryeo balhae was founded by a goguryeo general and formed as a successor state to goguryeo during its height balhae controlled most of manchuria and parts of the russian far east and was called the prosperous country in the east later silla was a golden age of art and culture as evidenced by the hwangnyongsa seokguram and emille bell relationships between korea and china remained relatively peaceful during this time later silla carried on the maritime prowess of baekje which acted like the phoenicia of medieval east asia and during the th and th centuries dominated the seas of east asia and the trade between china korea and japan most notably during the time of jang bogo in addition silla people made overseas communities in china on the shandong peninsula and the mouth of the yangtze river later silla was a prosperous and wealthy country and its metropolitan capital of gyeongju was the fourth largest city in the world buddhism flourished during this time and many korean buddhists gained great fame among chinese buddhists and contributed to chinese buddhism including woncheuk wonhyo uisang musang and kim gyogak a silla prince whose influence made mount jiuhua one of the four sacred mountains of chinese buddhism however later silla weakened under internal strife and the revival of baekje and goguryeo which led to the later three kingdoms period in the late th century unified dynastiesedit in  the later three kingdoms were united by wang geon a descendant of goguryeo nobility who established goryeo as the successor state of goguryeo balhae had fallen to the khitan empire in  and a decade later the last crown prince of balhae fled south to goryeo where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by wang geon thus unifying the two successor nations of goguryeo like silla goryeo was a highly cultural state and invented the metal movable type printing press after defeating the khitan empire which was the most powerful empire of its time in the goryeo–khitan war goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century during which the tripitaka koreana was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy literature religion and science by  there were  universities that produced famous scholars and scientists however the mongol invasions in the th century greatly weakened the kingdom goryeo was never conquered by the mongols but exhausted after three decades of fighting the korean court sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to kublai khan who accepted and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince henceforth goryeo continued to rule korea though as a tributary ally to the mongols for the next  years during this period the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess in the midth century goryeo drove out the mongols to regain its northern territories briefly conquered liaoyang and defeated invasions by the red turbans however in  general yi seonggye who had been ordered to attack china turned his army around and staged a coup yi seonggye declared the new name of korea as joseon in reference to gojoseon and moved the capital to hanseong one of the old names of seoul the first  years of the joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education as well as the creation of hangul by sejong the great to promote literacy among the common people the prevailing ideology of the time was neoconfucianism which was epitomized by the seonbi class nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity between  and  toyotomi hideyoshi launched invasions of korea but his advance was halted by korean forces most notably the joseon navy led by admiral yi sunsin and his renowned turtle ship with assistance from righteous army militias formed by korean civilians and ming dynasty chinese troops through a series of successful battles of attrition the japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw and relations between all parties became normalized however the manchus took advantage of joseons warweakened state and invaded in  and  and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynasty after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty joseon experienced a nearly year period of peace kings yeongjo and jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the th century in the th century the royal inlaw families gained control of the government leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country furthermore the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy earning the nickname the hermit kingdom but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders after the first sinojapanese war and the russojapanese war korea was occupied by japan – at the end of world war ii the japanese surrendered to soviet and us forces who occupied the northern and southern halves of korea respectively modern historyedit main article history of south korea war memorial of korea built in remembrance of the korean war – between  and  the south korean economy grew at an average of  annually fueled by annual export growth of  in a period called the miracle on the han river president park chunghee played a pivotal in rapidly developing the south korean economy through exportoriented industrialization president kim daejung the  nobel peace prize recipient for advancing democracy and human rights in south korea and east asia and for reconciliation with north korea was sometimes called the nelson mandela of asia korea was the first chair of the g during the  seoul summit despite the initial plan of a unified korea in the  cairo declaration escalating cold war antagonism between the soviet union and the united states eventually led to the establishment of separate governments each with its own ideology leading to the division of korea into two political entities in  north korea and south korea in the south syngman rhee an opponent of communism who had been backed and appointed by the united states as head of the provisional government won the first presidential elections of the newly declared republic of korea in may in the north a former antijapanese guerrilla and communist activist kim ilsung was appointed premier of the democratic peoples republic of korea in september in october the soviet union declared kim ilsungs government as sovereign over both parts the un declared rhees government as a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of korea where the un temporary commission on korea was able to observe and consult and the government based on elections which was observed by the temporary commission in addition to a statement that this is the only such government in korea both leaders began an authoritarian repression of their political opponents inside their region seeking for a unification of korea under their control while south koreas request for military support was denied by the united states north koreas military was heavily reinforced by the soviet union on june   north korea invaded south korea sparking the korean war the cold wars first major conflict which continued until  at the time the soviet union had boycotted the united nations un thus forfeiting their veto rights this allowed the un to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior north korean forces would unify the entire country the soviet union and china backed north korea with the later participation of millions of chinese troops after an ebb and flow that saw both sides almost pushed to the brink of extinction and massive losses among korean civilians in both the north and the south the war eventually reached a stalemate the  armistice never signed by south korea split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line no peace treaty was ever signed resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war over  million people died during the korean war in  a student uprising the april  revolution led to the resignation of the autocratic corrupt president syngman rhee a period of political instability followed broken by general park chunghees may  coup against the weak and ineffectual government the next year park took over as president until his assassination in  overseeing rapid exportled economic growth as well as implementing political repression park was heavily criticised as a ruthless military dictator who in  extended his rule by creating a new constitution which gave the president sweeping almost dictatorial powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of sixyear terms however the korean economy developed significantly during parks tenure and the government developed the nationwide expressway system the seoul subway system and laid the foundation for economic development during his year tenure the years after parks assassination were marked again by political turmoil as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void in  there came the coup détat of december twelfth led by general chun doohwan following the coup détat chun doohwan planned to rise to power through several measures on may  chun doohwan forced the cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation which had previously not applied to the island of jejudo the expanded martial law closed universities

fourth largest economy in asia and the th largest in the world it is a mixed economy dominated by familyowned conglomerates called chaebols however the dominance of chaebol is unlikely and at risk to support the transformation of korean economy for the future generations south korea is famous for its spectacular rise from one of the poorest countries in the world to a developed highincome country in just one generation this economic miracle commonly known as the miracle on the han river brought south korea to the ranks of elite countries in the oecd and the g south korea still remains one of the fastest growing developed countries in the world following the great recession it is included in the group of next eleven countries that will dominate the global economy in the middle of the st century by creating favorable policy directive for economic development as preceded by japanese economic recovery as the logistic supplying bastion for american troops in the korean peninsula during and after the korean war south koreas rigorous education system and the establishment of a highly motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the countrys high technology boom and rapid economic development having almost no natural resources and always suffering from overpopulation in its small territory which deterred continued population growth and the formation of a large internal consumer market south korea adapted an exportoriented economic strategy to fuel its economy and in  south korea was the seventh largest exporter and seventh largest importer in the world bank of korea and korea development institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of south korea in the  asian financial crisis the south korean economy suffered a liquidity crisis and relied on the bailout by the imf that restructured and modernized the south korean economy with successive djnomics policy by president kim dae jung including the resultant of the national development of the ict industry historically subsidies were used as means of speeding up adoption of new technology in korea and has ultimately helped the adoption and development of faster mobile standards for the economy of south korea the growth of ict industry has been far concentrated on the hardware sector which focuses on expanding wired and wireless telecommunication network penetration rather than the software sector which creates innovative applications and valueadded services the economy of south korea is the global leader of consumer electronics mobile broadband and smartphones south koreas lcd tv global market share also jumped to  percent in  from  percent at the end of  and it will soon replace japan as the world’s numberone lcd tv supplier the economy of south korea ranks no in the world in ict development index   and  bloomberg innovation index despite the south korean economys high growth potential and apparent structural stability south korea suffers perpetual damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to the belligerence of north korea in times of deep military crises which has an adverse effect on the financial markets of the south korean economy however renowned financial organizations such as the international monetary fund also compliment the resilience of the south korean economy against various economic crises citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address any expected financial emergencies other financial organizations like the world bank describe korea as one of the fastestgrowing major economies of the next generation along with bric and indonesia south korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession

economy again recovered with the recordsurplus of us billion mark of the current account in the end of  up  percent growth from  amid uncertainties of the global economic turmoil with major economic output being the technology products exports south korea was a historical recipient of official development assistance oda from oecd throughout the s until the mids south koreas economic prosperity as measured in gdp by ppp per capita was still only a fraction of industrialized nations in  the south korean gdp per capita was  about onethird of nearby developed asian economies such as singapore hong kong and japan since then south korea has advanced into a developed economy to eventually attain a gdp per capita of  in  almost thirteen times the figure thirty years ago the whole countrys gdp increased from  billion to  billion in the same time frame in  south korea officially became the first major recipient of oda to have ascended to the status of a major donor of oda between  and  south

war south korea remained one of the poorest countries in the world for over a decade in  its gross domestic product per capita was  lower than that of some subsaharan countries the growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to economic development in  manufacturing industries accounted for approximately  percent of the gross domestic product gdp and  percent of the work force benefiting from strong domestic encouragement and foreign aid seouls industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities at a rapid pace increased the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion as a result industry altered the countrys landscape drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers a downturn in the south korean economy in  spurred by a sharp decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the industrial sector ministry of trade and industry analysts stated that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded in the nations economy including an overly strong won increased wages and high labor costs frequent strikes and high interest rates the result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in production at a number of electronics automobile and textile manufacturers as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labor to boost productivity with a much smaller work force and to improve competitiveness it was estimated that over twothirds of south koreas manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for facility investments on automation currently korea is a developed country with a developed market rapid growth from s to sedit south koreas real gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than  percent per year from us billion in  to us billion in  breaking the trillion dollar mark in  nominal gdp per capita grew from  in  to  in  reaching the  milestone in  the manufacturing sector grew from  percent of the gnp in  to  percent in  commodity trade volume rose from us million in  to a projected us billion in  the ratio of domestic savings to gnp grew from  percent in  to  percent in  in  south koreas rate of growth first exceeded north koreas rate of growth in most industrial areas though south koreas per capita gnp was still lower the most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early scitation needed this strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of south koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market the strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which south korea could develop a competitive advantage government initiatives played an important role in this process through the model of exportled industrialization the south korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highlycompetitive global market by adhering to state regulations and demands firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fastpaced evolving international arena in addition the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings these efforts enabled south korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income by emphasizing the industrial sector seouls exportoriented development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped except for mining most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast heavy industries generally were located in the south of the country factories in seoul contributed over  percent of all manufacturing valueadded in  taken together with factories in surrounding gyeonggi province factories in the seoul area produced  percent of all manufacturing that year factories in seoul and gyeonggi province employed  percent of the nations  million factory workers increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a serious problem by the s and remained a problem despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural living standards in the early s in order to control inflation a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted growth of the money supply was reduced from the  percent level of the s to  percent seoul even froze its budget for a short while government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote competition to reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors seoul expanded investments in public projects such as roads and communications facilities while further promoting farm mechanization the measures implemented early in the decade coupled with significant improvements in the world economy helped the south korean economy regain its lost momentum in the late s south korea achieved an average of  percent real growth between  and  and  percent between  and  the doubledigit inflation of the s was brought under control wholesale price inflation averaged  percent per year from  through  consumer prices increased by an average of  percent annually seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance of payments in  and recorded a us billion and a

balance was projected for citation needed s and the asian financial crisisedit for the first half of the s the south korean economy continued a stable and strong growth in both private consumption and gdp things changed quickly in  with the asian financial crisis after several other asian currencies were attacked by speculators the korean won started to heavily depreciate in october  the problem was exacerbated by the problem of nonperforming loans at many of koreas merchant banks by december  the imf had approved a usd  billion loan that would be part of a usd  billion bailout plan by

asian financial crisis can be attributed to labor adjustments ie a dynamic and productive labor market with flexible wage rates and alternative funding sources by the first quarter of  gdp growth had

year on year as in the  crisis koreas currency also experienced massive fluctuations declining by  against the dollar annual growth in the economy slowed to  in  and was expected to drop to as low as  by goldman sachs but south korea was able to limit the downturn to a near standstill at  in  despite the global financial crisis the south korean economy helped by timely stimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated for a drop in exports was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialized economies posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of the crisis in  south korea made a strong economic rebound with a growth rate of  signaling a return of the economy to precrisis levels south koreas export has recorded  billion in the first eleven months of the year  already higher than its export in the whole year of  the south korean economy of the st century as a next eleven economy is expected to grow from  to  annually between  and  similar to growth rates of developing countries such as brazil or russia the south korean government signed the koreaaustralia free trade agreement kafta on december   with the australian government seeking to benefit its numerous industries—including automotive services and resources and energy—and position itself alongside competitors such as the us and asean south korea is australia’s third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a  trade value of a billion the agreement contains an investor state dispute settlement isds clause that permits legal action from south korean corporations against the australian government if their trade rights are infringed upon the government cut the work week from six days to five in phases from  to  depending on the size of the

manufacturers planned a significant shift in future production plans toward hightechnology industries in june  panels of government officials scholars and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials mechatronics—including industrial robotics—bioengineering microelectronics fine chemistry and aerospace this shift in emphasis however did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production which had dominated the economy in the scitation needed south korea relies largely upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy with finished products such as electronics textiles ships automobiles and steel being some of its most important exports although the import market has liberalized in recent years the agricultural market has remained largely protectionist due to serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market as of  the price of rice in south korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on the international market and it was generally feared that opening the agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the south korean agricultural sector in late  however an agreement was reached with the wto in which south korean rice imports will gradually increase from  to  of consumption by  in addition up to  of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by  where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods following  the south korean rice market will be fully openedcitation

industry of south korea that boomed since the s during the s and s south korea became a leading producer of ships including oil supertankers and oildrilling platforms the countrys major shipbuilder was hyundai which built a millionton capacity drydock at ulsan in the mids daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in  and finished a millionton facility at okpo on geoje island south of busan in mid the industry declined in the mids because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession there was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late s new orders for  totaled  million gross tons valued at us billion decreases from the previous year of  percent and  percent respectively these declines were caused by labor unrest seouls unwillingness to provide financial assistance and tokyos new lowinterest export financing in support of japanese shipbuilders however the south korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing

in the korean peninsula during and after the korean war south koreas rigorous education system and the establishment of a highly motivated and educated populace is largely responsible for spurring the countrys high technology boom and rapid economic development having almost no natural resources and always suffering from overpopulation in its small territory which deterred continued population

ultimately helped the adoption and development of faster mobile standards for the economy of south korea the growth of ict industry has been far concentrated on the hardware sector which focuses on expanding wired and wireless telecommunication network penetration rather than the software sector which creates innovative applications and valueadded services the economy of south korea is the

potential and apparent structural stability south korea suffers perpetual damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to the belligerence of north korea in times of deep military crises which has an adverse effect on the financial markets of the south korean economy however renowned financial organizations such as the international monetary fund also compliment the resilience of the south korean economy against various economic crises citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address any expected financial emergencies other financial organizations like the world bank describe korea as one of the fastestgrowing major economies of the next generation along with bric and indonesia south korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to

following the korean war south korea remained one of the poorest countries in the world for over a decade in  its gross domestic product per capita was  lower than that of some subsaharan countries the growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to economic development in  manufacturing industries accounted for approximately  percent of the gross domestic product gdp and  percent of the work force benefiting from strong domestic encouragement and foreign aid seouls industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities at a rapid pace increased the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion as a result industry altered the countrys landscape drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers a downturn in the south korean economy in  spurred by a sharp decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the industrial sector ministry of trade and industry analysts stated that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded in the nations economy including an overly strong won increased wages and high labor costs frequent strikes and high interest rates the result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in production at a number of electronics automobile and textile manufacturers as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labor to boost productivity with a much smaller work force and to improve competitiveness it was estimated that over twothirds of south koreas manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for facility investments on automation currently korea is a developed country with a developed market rapid growth from s to sedit south koreas real gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than  percent per year from us billion in  to us billion in  breaking the trillion dollar mark in  nominal gdp per capita grew from  in  to  in  reaching the  milestone in  the manufacturing sector grew from  percent of the gnp in  to  percent in  commodity trade volume rose from us million in  to a projected us billion in  the ratio of domestic savings to gnp grew from  percent in  to  percent in  in  south koreas rate of growth first exceeded north koreas rate of growth in most industrial areas though south koreas per capita gnp was still lower the most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early scitation needed this strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of south koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market the strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which south korea could develop a competitive advantage government initiatives played an important role in this process through the model of exportled industrialization the south korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highlycompetitive global market by adhering to state regulations and demands firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fastpaced evolving international arena in addition the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings these efforts enabled south korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income by emphasizing the industrial sector seouls exportoriented development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped except for mining most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast heavy industries generally were located in the south of the country factories in seoul contributed over  percent of all manufacturing valueadded in  taken together with factories in surrounding gyeonggi province factories in the seoul area produced  percent of all manufacturing that year factories in seoul and gyeonggi province employed  percent of the nations  million factory workers increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a serious problem by the s and remained a problem despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural living standards in the early s in order to control inflation a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted growth of the money supply was reduced from the  percent level of the s to  percent seoul even froze its budget for a short while government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote competition to reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors seoul expanded investments in public projects such as roads and communications facilities while further promoting farm mechanization the measures implemented early in the decade coupled with significant improvements in the world economy helped the south korean economy regain its lost momentum in the late s south korea achieved an average of  percent real growth between  and  and  percent between  and  the doubledigit inflation of the s was brought under control wholesale price inflation averaged

gdp things changed quickly in  with the asian financial crisis after several other asian currencies were attacked by speculators the korean won started to heavily depreciate in october  the problem

economy with finished products such as electronics textiles ships automobiles and steel being some of its most important exports although the import market has liberalized in recent years the agricultural market has remained largely protectionist due to serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market as of  the price of rice in south korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on the international market and it was generally feared that opening the agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the south korean agricultural sector in late  however an agreement was reached with the wto in which south korean rice imports will gradually increase from  to  of consumption by  in addition up to  of

the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion as a result industry altered the countrys landscape drawing millions of laborers to urban manufacturing centers a downturn in the south korean economy in  spurred by a sharp decrease in exports and foreign orders caused deep concern in the industrial sector ministry of trade and industry analysts stated that poor export performance resulted from structural problems embedded in the nations economy including an overly strong won increased wages and high labor costs frequent strikes and high interest rates the result was an increase in inventories and severe cutbacks in production at a number of electronics automobile and textile manufacturers as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labor to boost productivity with a much smaller work force and to improve competitiveness it was estimated that over twothirds of south koreas manufacturers spent over half of the funds available for facility investments on automation currently korea is a developed country

rose from us million in  to a projected us billion in  the ratio of domestic savings to gnp grew from  percent in  to  percent in  in  south koreas rate of growth first exceeded north koreas rate of growth in most industrial areas though south koreas per capita gnp was still lower the most significant factor in rapid industrialization was the adoption of an outwardlooking strategy in the early scitation needed this strategy was particularly wellsuited to that time because of south koreas poor natural resource endowment low savings rate and tiny domestic market the strategy promoted economic growth through laborintensive manufactured exports in which south korea could develop a competitive advantage government initiatives played an important role in this process through the model of exportled industrialization the south korean government incentivized corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency in order to compete in the highlycompetitive global market by adhering to state regulations and demands firms were awarded subsidization and investment support to rapidly develop their export markets in the fastpaced evolving international arena in addition the inflow of foreign capital was greatly encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings these efforts enabled south korea to achieve rapid growth in exports and subsequent increases in income by emphasizing the industrial sector seouls exportoriented development strategy left the rural sector relatively underdeveloped except for mining most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast heavy industries generally were located in the south of the country factories in seoul contributed over  percent of all manufacturing valueadded in  taken together with factories in surrounding gyeonggi province factories in the seoul area produced  percent of all manufacturing that year factories in seoul and gyeonggi province employed  percent of the nations  million factory workers increasing income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a serious problem by the s and remained a problem despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural living standards in the early s in order to control inflation a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted growth of the money supply was reduced from the  percent level of the s to  percent seoul even froze its budget for a short while government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalized to promote competition to reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors seoul expanded investments in public projects such as roads and communications facilities while further promoting farm mechanization the measures implemented early in the decade coupled with significant improvements in the world economy helped the south korean economy regain its lost momentum in the late s south korea achieved an average of  percent real growth between  and  and  percent between  and  the doubledigit inflation of the s was brought under control wholesale price inflation averaged

consumer goods sales dropping  exports in autos and semiconductors two critical pillars of the economy shrank  and  respectively while exports overall fell by a record  in january and  in february  year on year as in the  crisis koreas currency also experienced massive fluctuations declining by  against the dollar annual growth in the economy slowed to  in  and was expected to drop to as low as  by goldman sachs but south korea was able to limit the downturn to a near standstill at  in  despite the global financial crisis the south korean economy helped by timely stimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated for a drop in exports was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialized economies posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of the crisis in  south korea made a strong economic rebound with a growth rate of  signaling a return of the economy to precrisis levels south koreas export has recorded  billion in the first eleven months of the year  already higher than its export in the whole year of  the south korean economy of the st century as a next eleven economy is expected to grow from  to  annually between  and  similar to growth rates of developing countries such as brazil or russia the south korean government signed the koreaaustralia free trade agreement kafta on december   with the australian government seeking to benefit its numerous industries—including automotive services and resources and energy—and position itself alongside competitors such as the us and asean south korea is australia’s third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a  trade value of a billion the agreement contains an investor state dispute settlement isds clause that permits legal action from south

manufacturers planned a significant shift in future production plans toward hightechnology industries in june  panels of government officials scholars and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials mechatronics—including industrial robotics—bioengineering microelectronics fine chemistry and aerospace this shift in emphasis however did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production which had dominated the economy in the scitation needed south korea relies largely upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy with finished products such as electronics textiles ships automobiles and steel being some of its most important exports although the import market has liberalized in recent years the agricultural market has remained largely protectionist due to serious disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market as of  the price of rice in south korea is about four times that of the average price of rice on the international market and it was generally feared that opening the agricultural market would have disastrous effects upon the south korean agricultural sector in late  however an agreement was reached with the wto in which south korean rice imports will gradually increase from  to  of consumption by  in addition up to  of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by  where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods following  the south korean rice market will be fully openedcitation

industry of south korea that boomed since the s during the s and s south korea became a leading producer of ships including oil supertankers and oildrilling platforms the countrys major shipbuilder was hyundai which built a millionton capacity drydock at ulsan in the mids daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in  and finished a millionton facility at okpo on geoje island south of busan in mid the industry declined in the mids because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession there was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late s new orders for  totaled  million gross tons valued at us billion decreases from the previous year of  percent and  percent respectively these declines were caused by labor unrest seouls unwillingness to provide financial assistance and tokyos new lowinterest export financing in support of japanese shipbuilders however the south korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing

elaboration of president richard m nixons policy of vietnamization in the early s south korea began to manufacture many of its own weapons since the s south korea now in possession of more modern military technology than in previous generations has actively begun shifting its defense industrys areas of interest more from its previously homeland defenseoriented militarization efforts to the promotion of military equipment and technology as mainstream products of exportation to boost its international trade some of its key military export projects include the t firtina selfpropelled
